2021-11-02-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Education (a) from 2011 to 2021, what is the annual number of cases of mental distress or psychiatric issues reported by teaching staff in (i) Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges, (ii) Institutes of Technical Education, (iii) Polytechnics, and (iv) Autonomous Universities; and (b) in light of the next normal of living with COVID-19 and home-based learning in 2020/2021 and beyond, what is the Ministry doing to alleviate the stress encountered by teaching staff.",1,1,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00001
2021-11-02-T-001,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Education (a) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether there has been an increase in a teacher’s workload and blurring of lines between work and personal time; (b) whether steps have been taken to measure the mental health index of our teachers; and (c) whether there are efforts to ensure that our teachers are not overwhelmed and suffer from burnout.",1,2,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00002
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?",1,3,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00003
2021-11-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,4,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00004
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our teaching staff have shouldered a heavy responsibility to ensure that our students can continue learning safely during this COVID-19 pandemic. Workload for teaching staff has increased as they are responsible for ensuring that students are educated about and comply with the safe management measures. Each time a confirmed case is notified, staff need to follow-up on contact tracing and communications. When home-based learning (HBL) was declared, teaching staff also needed to make the necessary arrangements, with additional support for students who may not adjust as well to HBL. All these efforts are necessary to allow teaching and learning to continue, despite the pandemic.",1,5,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00005
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To keep track of staff sentiments and well-being, MOE conducts dipstick polls, school visits by senior management and engagement surveys. The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) also conduct surveys and staff engagements with leaders.",2,6,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00006
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE and the IHLs have put in place measures to address the concerns raised by staff on workload. At the system-level, MOE has reprioritised initiatives and reduced schools’ involvement in HQ work and pilots.",3,7,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00007
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Schools have also been given greater flexibility to pace the implementation of selected initiatives, including deferring implementation, if it helps to spread out staff workload. For example, Secondary schools and JCs were given the option to defer the implementation of Blended Learning to 2022 instead of Term 3 of 2021, as originally planned.",4,8,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00008
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At the school-level, we recognise that ground practices may vary. We have called on school leaders to reprioritise school programmes, establish clear expectations on teachers’ availability and work hours and encourage supervisors to check in with their officers regularly. For example, school leaders have been providing guidance on avoiding parent-staff communications after school operating hours except for urgent matters, such as those involving the safety and well-being of students. This can minimise the blurring of lines between work and personal time.",5,9,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00009
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In line with the streamlined health protocols, ring-fencing policies and contact tracing processes in schools have now also been significantly simplified and teachers’ workload related to COVID-19 management is being reduced.",6,10,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00010
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Similarly, the IHLs have implemented various measures tailored to their institutions, such as reprioritisation of work tasks, to reduce workload and setting clearer expectations that staff need not reply to work emails after office hours unless there are exigencies.",7,11,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00011
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To support staff who need help, MOE provides free counselling services. In addition, MOE, Polytechnic and ITE staff who are public officers can access the whole-of-Government counselling hotline. Staff in the Autonomous Universities have access to either in-house or external counselling services. Before COVID-19, about 50 staff from our schools sought support from MOE’s in-house counsellors annually. The annual number has increased to about 80 since 2020. Similarly, the number of IHL teaching staff seeking counselling support has increased. We do not have more detailed data, as information from all counselling sessions is kept confidential and staff are not required to report mental distress or psychiatric issues.",8,12,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00012
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We recognise the exceptional demands that COVID-19 has placed on our staff and have put in additional effort to promote a positive and supportive work environment for staff well-being across schools and IHLs, such as organising workshops covering stress management and self-care. As part of a new well-being initiative since September 2021, schools have nominated Wellness Ambassadors for staff to receive training on how to provide basic peer support and encourage their peers to seek help. Training has commenced in end-October. Some IHLs are implementing similar initiatives.",9,13,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00013
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To support staff in implementing home-based learning effectively, MOE and the IHLs have provided professional development courses and resources. Learning teams within and across schools also allow staff to collaborate and share good practices on the design and delivery of online lessons.",10,14,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00014
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The well-being of our staff is of paramount importance and MOE and the IHLs will continue to strengthen our support for staff to help ensure their well-being.,11,15,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00015
2021-11-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Patrick Tay.,1,16,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00016
2021-11-02-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),I thank the Minister for his reply and note the sensitivity of some of the information. I have three supplementary questions for the Minister.,1,17,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00017
2021-11-02-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Firstly, yes, we are aware and we thank MOE for the various mitigation measures to help lighten the stress and mental distress of teachers as well as educators across our educational institutions. The first question is, what are the further concrete steps that MOE can take to reduce further pressures from various stakeholders, non-essential workload and support better work-life harmony, so that teachers and educators can also attend to their loved ones?",2,18,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00018
2021-11-02-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"The second supplementary question is, can I suggest to the Minister that school leaders, especially, set the tone to look after the well-being of teachers, staff and educators in operationalising MOE's policies as well as meeting the schools' expectations?",3,19,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00019
2021-11-02-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"My third supplementary question is, to overcome mental health and well-being issues, can I ask MOE HQ and educational institutions alike to work closely with our teachers as well as with teachers' and education's cluster of unions to better manage this issue on the ground, as we hear it is brewing; and in addition, also partnering the community and building the right societal values, especially as we move and chart the way forward in the next normal?",4,20,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00020
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his questions and, more importantly, for his concerns for the welfare and well-being of our teachers. I should say a couple of things to set the context as I answer the three supplementary questions from Mr Patrick Tay.",1,21,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00021
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, I think we should all thank our teachers and educators because, over the last two years, it has really been very tough on them. We are one of the few systems in the entire world that have managed to keep our schools going and to allow our students to continue learning with minimum disruptions during the last two years. So, I really want to say a big ""Thank You"" to all our teachers for going all out.",2,22,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00022
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Not many of us realise that in order to keep our school system going, the workload for our teachers has more than doubled. In order for us to switch seamlessly from physical schooling to home-based learning, our teachers need to spend a lot of time preparing more than two sets of lesson plans  one set of lesson plans for the school, the physical schooling; and one set of lesson plans for the home-based learning, just in case we need to switch over seamlessly. On top of that, to be able to take care of the higher-needs students who would still need to return to the school during the home-based learning period.",3,23,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00023
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On top of all this, the school leaders and teachers also have to perform the role of contact tracing in case there are cases in the school. We have to do this without additional manpower support. We have seen the challenges that even MOH, together with the support of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), had and how big a challenge this can be. So, all the more, I am deeply appreciative of the efforts by our teachers.",4,24,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00024
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the course of the last two years, be it the vaccination programme or the mental and social emotional stresses experienced by our students and their families, many of these will culminate in their experiences in the school, which our teachers also have to manage.",5,25,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00025
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"With that at the back of our mind, what can we do as a society to help our teachers manage? Because they are, ultimately, not only teachers but they are also fellow Singaporeans. They also have families that they need to take care of.",6,26,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00026
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I would like to answer the three supplementary questions from Mr Patrick Tay in three parts  what are things that we can do in the short term, things that we can do in the longer term and things that we, as a whole-of-society, can do together to better support our teachers. The fundamental belief is this  if our teachers are well taken care of, they will be able to take care of all our children well. But if our teachers are not well taken care of, if they are not in the best condition, then it is also very difficult for us to expect them to take good care of our children, our students.",7,27,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00027
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the short term, as I have mentioned, we have adjusted various programmes in order to lighten the workload of our teachers. We have adjusted the schedule as to how we roll out new programmes. We have given the schools some of the flexibility to adjust the scheduling, for example, the implementation of blended learning. And for the Full Subject-Based Banding roll-out, we will have to make some adjustments in order to alleviate the workload on our teachers.",8,28,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00028
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing that we can do in the short term is to use technology for us to scale up the lessons, especially for home-based learning. While in the long term, this will help to lighten the workload of our teachers, in the short term, it actually requires our teachers to do more because we have to switch over from the current physical schooling curriculum to the online curriculum. Many of our teachers will need to learn new skills. But our hope is that, over the longer term, as we leverage technology to scale up the lesson preparation and even some of the class sizes, then we will be able to devote more time to the higher-needs students.",9,29,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00029
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Overall, as a system, it is quite unrealistic for us to expect that we can double the amount of resources overnight. In order to focus more attention and bandwidth on the high-needs students, we will need to find other ways to scale up our curriculum teaching so that we can save some time and bandwidth on the other areas where we can.",10,30,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00030
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third thing in the short term that we have done is to insert what we call surgical breaks into the term time so that, in case there is a spike in the number of cases where the workload is very high, we can give our teachers a slight break. An example of this is, this year, Term 4, where we took one extra day to declare it as a school holiday after the PSLE marking. That one extra day would have given us a period of about nine days continuously for some of our teachers to take a bit of a break and to spread out their load during the PSLE marking. These are things that we will continue to do.",11,31,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00031
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The fourth thing that we are doing is to make sure that when MOE communicates with our teachers, we do it systematically. We know that this is a large system that operates with 50,000 educators, more than half a million students. We try not to make too many changes too quickly. This allows time for the teachers and the school leadership teams to make the necessary adjustments.",12,32,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00032
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the longer term, we would need to do much more to help our teachers cope. One is to use technology to scale up our teaching resources so that we can, as I have mentioned, apply the time more surgically to the higher-needs students.",13,33,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00033
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing that we can do to better equip our teachers to manage this is to equip them with the skillsets to detect potential mental health issues among the students and their fellow peers. We are applying it, starting from the National Institute of Education (NIE) curriculum, all the way to their professional development and continuing training. So, these are things we will do over the longer term.",14,34,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00034
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the longer term, I would also like to see our teachers systematically given a break or sabbatical, whereby they can go out and recharge themselves. And not just to recharge themselves but also for them to acquire new perspectives, new skills, new connections to bring back to the school. That is my wish over the long term and we will progressively roll this out.",15,35,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00035
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, can I say that to better support our teachers, we really need a whole-of-society approach. Let me say this  I think our teachers work very hard; they care a lot for our students. I do not think our teachers are afraid to work hard. But in working hard, they must be given a sense of agency, that they are in control, that they are doing things with conviction. That is important. And this is why I keep emphasising that no matter how hard our teachers and school leaders work, they must feel that they are in control, with a sense of agency. They can take charge of things, they can customise the curriculum according to the needs of their students, because every school has a different profile of students and no two children are similar. We need to allow teachers and school leaders that autonomy to customise the programmes according to their school needs, according to their students' needs.",16,36,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00036
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing that I think I would say is that we, as a whole-of-society, must also help our teachers in a form of partnership. I will give a very simple example. Our teachers care a lot, many of our teachers even give their handphone numbers to their students, just in case their students get into trouble outside school hours. And I have heard many stories of our students, sometimes calling the teachers in the middle of the night because they got kicked out of home, because of family issues and our teachers respond. This is the extent to which our teachers go, to take care of our students beyond the curriculum time in school.",17,37,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00037
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But in giving out their handphone numbers to the families and the students, we also hope that the families will not abuse the trust. It is one thing for the child to call up the teacher at midnight to say that he is in trouble. It is another thing for the parent to call up the teacher at midnight to ask whether tomorrow the child has spelling and should wear a red or blue T-shirt. If the child does not remember, so be it. It is part of his learning experience. We, as parents, do not need to overly protect our children and deprive them of the learning experience.",18,38,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00038
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I think we need to establish this clear understanding as expectations of parents and society, and that of ourselves, get heightened, a lot of expectations are projected onto our teachers as well. That is why we need to strengthen this partnership. This is the reason why I want to strengthen the partnership between the schools and the parents support groups, not so much just for the parents support groups to support the schools, but also for the parents support groups to support one another in helping one another set the correct expectations, so that we can have a strong partnership between parents and teachers in bringing up our children.",19,39,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00039
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Last but not least, I would say this  in the COVID-19 situation, there are many changes. We may not be perfect and we will not be perfect. All of us can pull together and help one another overcome some of the imperfections that we are facing. Sometimes, we have to make changes. Sometimes, we have to make changes at the last minute because of the circumstances. But all of us can pull together and help one another. For example, some families prefer HBL, some families prefer physical schooling. There will not be a situation where we can meet the needs of everyone.",20,40,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00040
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But we can all help one another, that when we do not get the things that we want for ourselves, for our families, let us not burden the teachers with the excessive demands on the teachers to try and fulfil our own personal needs. That, I think, will go a long way in helping our teachers cope as well. One of the common feedback from our teachers is that most of our parents are very supportive of our teachers, but there is a small minority of parents who place a very huge demand on our teachers. It is perhaps unfair for the teachers if they are unable to spend their time and take care of all the students because of the high demands placed on them by a very small group of parents.",21,41,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00041
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, we really hope and want to work together with the parents. We also want to work together with society, including the unions, so that we can better support our teachers in an all-rounded way.",22,42,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00042
2021-11-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"If I can remind Members, perhaps let us confine our supplementary questions to just two. And if I can request our office holders to keep the responses short. Ms Carrie Tan.",1,43,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00043
2021-11-02-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Speaker. And I thank Minister Chan for sharing about the short- and long-term perspectives of supporting teachers. I think our Government has always been very good with adopting technology enablement to support all our civil and public servants. We have always done very good on that front. But Minister Chan has also acknowledged that a lot of the stress that the teachers feel come from students reaching out to them, things that happen outside of the classroom.",1,44,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00044
2021-11-02-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"So, I would like to add on to the perspective of our support to teachers on the human support element. I would like to ask the Minister whether any of the support plans that MOE has rendered to teachers can involve none of them requiring to be further trained. When we try to support someone, but we also require them to go through further training to provide peer support, again it adds to the load on their bandwidth and stress.",2,45,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00045
2021-11-02-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Number two, I am not sure whether this was covered and I missed it  are there currently any cost subsidies that teachers can have access to when they need to see external counsellors or psychologists to deal with their stress or anxiety levels?",3,46,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00046
2021-11-02-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"And number three, in line with the perspective about rendering human support, whether MOE will consider, potentially in the long term, developing a team of Allied Educators' supporters or educator carers, to provide a listening ear and pastoral care to our teachers, so that they do not have to take the weight and the burden of all these difficult situations that they are faced with – whether it is their students' mental health, their own mental health – and they have someone to talk to?",4,47,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00047
2021-11-02-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"And lastly, the question is about whether MOE is effecting any kind of mindset change within the system and amongst school leadership and principals to change their mindset towards the notion that hard work is what it is, and teachers just need to suck it up. Because I think we have seen interviews of teachers that they feel like they do not have a safe space to go to. So, thank you, I hope the Minister can clarify on this.",5,48,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00048
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take the four supplementary questions in turn.",1,49,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00049
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, on the issue of training, we do want to equip our teachers to pick up the signs of distress that may happen to their students and also to their fellow peers. To the extent that we can, we would want to do this as part of their professional training. Having said that, one of the things about counselling services is this  be it students or teachers, they all need someone that they can trust in order for them to open up to the counsellors or to the peer, to share. Without this trusting relationship, it is not a function of how many counsellors that we have. Even if we have the counsellors, be they para-counsellors or full-time counsellors, we need this trust relationship to be established. Which is why from Secondary schools and above, we try as much as possible for the first layer to have the peer support, for each of them to be able to identify their own issues and also to look out for their peers. And then, we escalate it to either the family or the teachers, and we escalate it next level to the full-time counsellors. So, we need to triage this.",2,50,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00050
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second question, on the subsidy, I do not think the cost should be an issue. As I have mentioned in my reply, there are services available to all our teachers as part of the Public Service as well.",3,51,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00051
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Yes, we are trying to increase the number of Allied Educators and also the para-counsellors but, as I have mentioned, it is not just the numbers that are important; it is also the trust relationship that needs time to build up that is important for the students and the teachers to open up. Definitely, we want to promote a safe environment for people to come forward and seek help. Which is why, just now, in my reply, I mentioned that we do not actively go and track the number of people who seek help because we do not want to give people the wrong impression, that if people seek help, they become a part of the statistics and so forth.",4,52,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00052
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, if I may just make a pitch on this issue for people to come forward and seek help – be it the students or the teachers. We tend to look at mental health as a black or white issue  I am mentally okay, or I am mentally not okay. We may need to update our concept. Let us look at it as a kind of fitness level. We all grow in our fitness level, with a bit of training. Today, I might not be able to run as fast or as far. But with a bit of training, tomorrow I can run further and faster. And mental health is also like that. Today, I might not be able to cope with some things. But tomorrow, with a bit of training, stretching, I might be able to cope a bit more and that is how we grow as individuals.",5,53,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00053
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If we move away from the binary concept of mental health, then I think it would encourage people to come forward and say that we are much more prepared to come forward and seek help, if we think that we are unable to accomplish a task. There is no shame in this. Once we overcome that level of fitness and we become even fitter, we can then take on more stresses and that is how we grow as a person.",6,54,2021-11-02-T-001-S-00054
2021-11-02-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"With that perspective and that mindset in all school leaders, teachers and students, we will be able to better encourage our people to seek help when they need to.

Second, we are working with our NGO partners to make counselling and para-counselling more accessible. Third, mental healthcare has been made even more accessible. Any migrant worker identified to have need for or to benefit from mental healthcare will be linked up with the appropriate services, including the counselling hotlines. In particular, an escalation pathway with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has been developed to ensure timely care for more severe cases when necessary.",3,60,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00060

An earlier study, which was conducted by Yale-NUS on migrant workers' mental health from June to October 2020, showed no notable difference in stress, anxiety and depression levels amongst locals and migrant workers, although there were indications of higher levels of stress amongst migrant workers with movement restrictions.",4,61,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00061

Minister mentioned that we are ramping up psychological first aid training. Specifically, is this peer support training for migrant workers to provide support for each other, or is this support for employers to provide a more supportive workplace environment, in terms of mental wellness, or is it both?",1,69,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00069
2021-11-02-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Edward Chia for his supplementary question. Indeed, we approach this training on a very holistic manner because mental health awareness, the ability to be able to identify and escalate very quickly and to do constant surveillance and constant monitoring and engagement is a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach that is needed through the support of dorm operators, by our FAST ambassadors on the ground, by the employers, by the NGOs, the partners and, of course, ultimately, the tertiary healthcare providers, including IMH.",1,70,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00070

The DAWN task force started with seven core initiatives.

Can the Minister share with the House what were the considerations that determined that number 3,000? Why not 2,000 or 4,000, because that will give the public and those who are looking at this issue more closely some ideas as to when further opening can potentially take place or, at the very least, when certain foreign workers who may need a little bit more assistance can be attended to by the relevant agencies and individuals?",1,75,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00075

The question of easing the restrictions for our migrant workers to go out into the community is constantly on our minds, not just all of us in MOM, particularly the ACE Group.

We planned for the easing of the restrictions as early as December last year; this was about a month after we formed the DAWN task force.",1,76,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00076
2021-11-02-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"At different times when we planned, with the drawer plans that we have in place, each time, we were hit by different curve balls. You would have read about the Delta variant. At any particular point in time where we try to ramp up, easing the restrictions, there were new and significant turns of events that did not allow us to do so. We then focused on the singular approach of ensuring that all of our migrant workers are protected through vaccination. The vaccination centres were set up and our focus was really making sure that we protect them.",2,77,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00077
2021-11-02-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"When we were able to bring them up to a high level of vaccination within the dorms, again, we tried to work on a mechanism for easing. In my earlier interview with The Straits Times and with the media, I said, ""The key thing was finding a safe and a very calibrated manner"". And I think that there were obviously subsequent events that have overtaken us. In spite of that, once we have achieved that high level of vaccination, and we also had enough evidence to show that those of us who have received and completed the two doses of the vaccination, the incidence of complications was significantly less than for those who are unvaccinated. With that, we took on that pilot in mid-September to allow 500 to go out.",3,78,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00078
2021-11-02-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We also sought feedback through our survey with the migrant workers to ask them what would be important for them when they go out to visit these community areas. Many of them wanted to go to a religious place of worship. So, our ACE Group then engaged the Hindu temples, the mosques, as well as churches to see how we could accommodate them to let them fulfil their religious needs. We also worked with the shopkeepers and so on. We identified shopkeepers, the retail shops to make sure that social distancing was adequately maintained. We reached out to the churches, the temples, the mosques to get them to support us and we started that pilot visit.",4,79,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00079

In the beginning, we even had to nudge employers, because even though we opened up 500 a week, we found that, for a while, we were only getting about 50% to 60% of them coming on board. There were also migrant workers who signed up, only to cancel at the last minute. So, these are all the logistical issues and so on that we had to plan through. Once we were able to smoothen out all of these different gaps and so on, we then moved on to increasing the number to 3,000.",7,82,2021-11-02-T-002-S-00082

Thirty-two weeks, or about eight months, after he was arrested and released? It is very sad. The young man could have had a far better future. The question is  how can we bring across to more of our young people the danger of drugs? How can we also bring across to them and their families, that even if they are arrested, they will still have opportunities to reform and the agencies will help them give up drug-taking and that there can be a good future ahead?",10,144,2021-11-02-T-006-S-00144

You have done wrong, but that does not have to be the final word. Our system is designed to give second chances to help you rehabilitate. And many have succeeded. We have to get that point across. We changed our laws on dealing with pure drug abusers, to not treat them as criminals. Instead, we focus on getting them to change the drug habit. In Justin’s case, he was trafficking drugs and seems like he was also abusing drugs. But with the right help, he could also have changed. And our processes are structured to provide that guidance and help, after he is dealt with in Court.

As I have said, this was some eight months after he had been arrested and released. What happened in those eight months? He had been charged and the case was fixed for hearing. What else happened? I think it is difficult to say. Is it the fact that the case was coming on in seven days’ time? Did he speak with anyone about the oncoming case and his concerns? Were there other issues? How did he have traces of drugs in his blood? How is it that he appears to have consumed drugs before his fall?

Ms Denise Phua, in 2016, and Ms Sylvia Lim, in 2017, had asked if all persons under 18 can be supported with an Appropriate Adult during interviews. Given that the AAYS scheme applies to all persons under 16, the point really is whether it can be extended to persons who are 16 and 17. We have told both of them that this would be reviewed. There were some difficulties in expanding the scheme to suspects in this age group. So, we decided to operationalise the current process, which was announced in 2017, for a period first, while we consider if, and, if so, how we can deal with the issues. We will announce our decision in the next few months as to whether we can extend the AAYS scheme to persons who are 16 and 17 years old.",16,150,2021-11-02-T-006-S-00150

We do not track such data. It is also not meaningful for us to track it.

2021-11-02-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"I will emphasise this. Justin’s case falls in the small minority of 16%, because he was openly trafficking. The general approach when dealing with young suspects is to, where possible, avoid criminalising their conduct, give them a second chance and help them in their rehabilitation. Suitable youths who have been arrested for minor offences can be referred to diversionary programmes, such as the Guidance Programme introduced in 1997, which has a strong focus on counselling and rehabilitation. Placing youth offenders on diversionary programmes allows them to be accountable for their actions and prevents disruption in other areas of development, such as education.

Some of the special needs suspects may actually be non-verbal or non-communicative and perhaps only the family members understand what he or she is trying to say.

2021-11-02-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Nevertheless, as I have shared with the House earlier, there are constraints that we are facing with regard to the Appropriate Adult Scheme because essentially, the Appropriate Adults are volunteers. We will need more volunteers to support the expansion to cover more young suspects. In order for them to come on board, we need to train them. We also need to provide face-to-face training to ensure that the volunteers are well-equipped to perform their roles. During this current pandemic, there are constraints on conducting face-to-face training due to the safe distancing measures. Hence, it is not easy to ramp up the pool of Appropriate Adults quickly.",3,181,2021-11-02-T-006-S-00181
2021-11-02-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Currently, we have about 331 volunteers for the AAYS and 320 volunteers for the AAPMD. As an estimate, if we expand the AAYS to cover suspects aged 16 and 17, we will need to increase the pool of volunteers to double of what we have today. If this age limit is further increased to 21, this would be even more significant. Expanding this scheme is not straightforward. Without a sufficient pool of Appropriate Adults, interviews will be delayed until an Appropriate Adult is available. This could add more strain on the person who is being investigated.",4,182,2021-11-02-T-006-S-00182

So, it is not that the person has to declare or has to ask for it. Even if the person does not ask for it, when we feel that it helps in the investigation process, we will activate it.

To manage COVID-19 importation risk, entry approvals for MDWs were tightened since May 2021, resulting in the number of MDWs entering Singapore being reduced from an average of 3,400 per month from January to April this year to 900 per month from May to October.",1,193,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00193

From 15 October 2021 onwards, we have opened up new applications for the entry of fully-vaccinated MDWs for entry from 1 November and after. More MDWs will be able to enter Singapore in the coming months if the COVID-19 situation continues to stabilise locally and regionally.",2,194,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00194

For those employers who are not successful, they may wish to access the application portal by ICA in subsequent weeks as entry slots are periodically made available.",3,195,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00195
2021-11-02-T-007,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"With more entry approvals in the coming months, the demand for transfer MDWs is expected to ease. Households that require MDWs urgently may wish to consider the commercial programme by Association of Employment Agencies (Singapore) or AEAS. MDWs who already possess documentation overseas can be on boarded onto the programme within a week and there are slots available. AEAS and its partner employment agencies will adjust the programme according to demand to compliment the entry of MDWs through the mainstream channel. As at end of October 2021, the AEAS initiative has facilitated the entry of more than 1,000 MDWs from the Philippines, Indonesia and Myanmar.",4,196,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00196

We are very thankful that MOM is able to increase the quota for MDWs. We know that many families are very anxious about getting their domestic workers to come to Singapore.

So, what is the number that MOM is expecting from November to maybe the next three months so that they can have better expectations?",1,201,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00201

2021-11-02-T-007,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"I thank the Member for the questions. On the number of MDWs who are waiting to enter Singapore for the next three months, there are several thousands. But I think the more important point is how we are able to gradually increase the entry of MDWs while protecting public health in Singapore. As I have said earlier on, we are committed to continue to look at increasing the entry approval quota, together with our MTF colleagues, so that we can clear as many MDWs to come in as possible for the next three months.",1,203,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00203

I was just looking at the information this morning, there are still slots available. In fact, MDWs overseas who have the documentation ready can be onboarded very quickly, within a week or two and can definitely arrive in Singapore within the month.",2,204,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00204
2021-11-02-T-007,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"On the question about the different countries, I think we all know that the common countries that MDWs come from are Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar and India. Indonesia and Philippines, because of the demand, many of the households in Singapore prefer MDWs from these two countries. So, naturally, there are more MDWs that are waiting to enter Singapore from these two countries.",3,205,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00205
2021-11-02-T-007,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Fortunately, for the past few months, the bulk of the 900 per month who entered Singapore were from Indonesia as well as the Philippines. For Myanmar and India, we also know flights were affected by the Not-to-land (NTL) that was determined by MTF. This NTL has been lifted recently. So, we are also hopeful that employers will be able to bring in the MDWs from Myanmar and India for the next few months. Again, the AEAS option already extends to Myanmar and, soon, to India as well. We hope that employers will keep an open mind and opt for this scheme if they need the MDWs to come in urgently.",4,206,2021-11-02-T-007-S-00206

Raising the retirement age is essential for Singapore because it benefits our workers for this new economy. Singaporeans can retire when they so choose but raising the retirement age will provide a vast majority of our workforce with a longer runway to contribute to the economy, learn new skills to stay engaged and be able to continue to earn a fair and decent wage to sustain their lives and further build their savings for retirement eventually.",1,212,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00212

Most recently, he helped to design and execute a new production facility in Tuas for a trading company which wanted to do its own manufacturing. He further guided them on how to manufacture these products to be of high quality so as to achieve local market sales.

Studies have shown that what matters more in a modern economy is the productivity of teams of workers, rather than individual workers. Hence, the solution might be to employ a mixture of vigorous young workers and more experienced older workers. We need to take careful steps to bring our society in tandem with our economy and, in doing so, allow employers to reap the benefits of such investments in human capital and employees to feel valued enough to continue innovating and increasing their productivity.",10,221,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00221

For example, energy specialists go through upskilling courses before they could advise MNCs that are aiming for net zero emissions, or factories looking to measure their Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) leading indicators. Digital tools should not be seen as the new takeover in making our economy an efficient one, but these tools are to assist our workers who are equipped with upgraded skills to effectively harness these tools. In this way, we can empower as many senior workers as possible who have credible experience in a vocation to translate their skills and experience to new areas of applications in the digital and green economy.",12,223,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00223

Some also highlight that they were subjected, or they felt that they had unfair re-employment contracts as they were offered re-employment with the same job scope while receiving a lower remuneration or benefits package.",9,235,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00235

2021-11-02-T-008,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In a recent discussion about retirement and re-employment with the residents in Pasir Ris, Ms Judith highlighted the common question of whether it was a case of “have to work” or “want to work” for our seniors.",11,237,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00237

2021-11-02-T-008,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To better prepare our senior workers, employers must deliberately engage them in a structured career planning conversation well before retirement age. Job requirements must be clearly defined, along with the relevant skills required such that workers are aware of the prerequisites for future re-employment. This would allow workers to add value to the organisation even as they mature. There should not be a case where age is used to assess the workers’ suitability for any job.",14,240,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00240
2021-11-02-T-008,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Hence, it is crucial that the extension of re-employment and retirement age must be accompanied by employers spending time developing a retirement and training plan for our maturing workers. For example, given that digital competencies are enablers for re-employment, can the Ministry consider basic digital skills training as a prerequisite for our senior workers in preparation for retirement?",15,241,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00241
2021-11-02-T-008,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another area to look into is the feasibility and adoption of flexible work arrangements that are already commonly practised around the world. Most of us start work in our 20s and, as we reach retirement age, we would have spent 40 years or more working. By then, there would be less financial pressure as our children would be independent and would likely want to spend more time outside of the work environment and enjoy a better quality of life as we head towards full retirement. Hence, it is understandable that our senior workers want to continue working but with a more flexible work arrangement more suited for their life stage. How do we encourage companies to consider flexible work arrangements, such as shorter work weeks, part-time employment or even job sharing between two or more persons?",16,242,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00242

However, they can be physically demanding and require long work hours which do not play to the strengths of our senior workers. How can we come together as a community and provide jobs that leverage on the strengths of our senior workers’ knowledge, experience and wisdom instead? What have we learnt from the past 20 months where many of us have been able to work productively from anywhere and at any time? Can we look into these remote and flexible work arrangements to ensure that our senior workers have more re-employment options?",19,245,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00245

Mature workers must be willing to train while our unions continue to encourage and assist, and Government agencies must provide structural support for this transformation. Though there are many job redesign initiatives in various industries, such as in cleaning and retail, how do we get more companies on board? Of the half million business entities in Singapore, how many are actively looking at job redesign to hire more workers? Given that job redesign takes a lot of effort and guidance, does the Ministry have sufficient resources devoted to this end? As a community, how do we encourage and adopt the right mindset to feel responsible in creating these employment opportunities for our senior workers?",23,249,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00249

Given our ageing population, it also enables businesses to tap on this experienced pool of workers. However, to meet the intent of the Bill, raising the retirement and re-employment age must be accompanied by efforts to reduce and, eventually, eliminate the barriers to a truly age-friendly labour market. We must expedite the necessary legislation to protect our senior workers and implement fundamental changes in our HR policies. We have to look into redesigning jobs to leverage on the strengths of our seniors. Together, we must look at this challenge holistically and realise that we all have a part to play in this solution.

I welcome more expedient payouts from the Public Trustee to a beneficiary representative. It may go some way to help dispel a persistent myth that unnominated monies are taken by the Government. This issue had been addressed more than once in this House and it was made clear repeatedly that CPF Board and the Public Trustee's Office (PTO) will attempt to locate and contact the next-of-kin so that they can claim the monies.

The grading meant that it has a sound structure with many good features but some areas for improvement. I believe our Government is always working towards closing the gaps.",3,274,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00274

The beneficiary representative would then distribute the monies to the beneficiaries. This would apply if the total amount of the member’s CPF monies does not exceed the specified limit. Does this policy serve to benefit the family of members who did not name any nominees? This would be welcomed as I have residents who are still waiting for years to resolve the distribution of CPF monies. Can the Ministry also clarify how this process will be simplified and sped up?

The topic of death remains a heavy one to broach and some CPF members tend to take it for granted that there will always be a seamless transfer of CPF monies to their families. I would take this opportunity to remind all that life is unpredictable. We all know that. Arranging how our assets will be distributed would bring great peace of mind. I also urge the Government to remind members in simple terms, if possible, and make it easier for them to nominate their beneficiaries.",6,277,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00277

As far as I am aware, refunds were never supposed to be given for accepted top-ups under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up scheme. And this is especially so because members who make CPF top-ups get personal income tax relief based on their contributions. This policy is clearly stated on the CPF website.

I think many members have raised this. I note that the payment of interest would cease upon notification of a member’s demise in respect of the amount outstanding to the credit of the member that has not been transferred to the general monies of the CPF. If it takes a significant length of time, like a year or so, that is quite a significant amount of interest that is lost.

They also appreciate that it is a safe and effective way to grow one’s retirement savings. I was a member of the CPF Advisory Panel from 2014 to 2016 and one of the recommendations was that every CPF member should be encouraged to have his or her own CPF LIFE plan with incentives to top-up the CPF Accounts for families with lower balances. This is especially important for housewives who are relying on their husband's CPF LIFE payouts, as women tend to outlive their husbands. The Panel had proposed then that members be allowed to transfer their CPF savings above what they require for Basic Retirement Sum to their spouses' Special or Retirement Accounts. In this way, each spouse would benefit from the extra interest for lower CPF balances and have their own lifelong income from CPF LIFE.",11,282,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00282

These tend to be the people who have lower incomes, who would benefit most from the additional top-ups. The difficulty to tap on large sums of CPF savings in times of need, such as a major illness, remains a significant pain point.

What are the Government’s plans, moving forth, to improve in this area? Besides CPF, are we looking at other options, like tax-approved group corporate retirement plans? Are there plans to increase the CPF withdrawal age? The Netherlands, which is among the top ranking on the index, is raising its pensions withdrawal age from 65 to 67 years old in 2024.",14,285,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00285

Besides the PTO’s actions taken to safeguard the rights and interests of the beneficiaries, the framework is in-built with a safeguard to only apply to cases where the deceased member’s un-nominated sums do not exceed this sum. This specified limit, in our view, strikes a balance between expediency in the disbursement of the funds and safeguarding of the beneficiaries’ rights and interests, particularly in the context of larger estates. A specified limit of $10,000 would allow around half of the current number of cases coming forward to make a claim for un-nominated sums and we believe that, of this half, a substantial number will be uncontentious and will benefit from an expedited scheme like this.",24,312,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00312

Apart from what I have mentioned earlier, let me highlight that the BR approach only requires the BR to provide proof that he or she is the eligible beneficiary with all the beneficiaries’ details, including his or her own. The BR need not submit proof of eligibility of all the other eligible beneficiaries, so this cuts down part of the administrative time and effort. The BR approach relieves the other beneficiaries from administrative inconvenience. By and large, in the majority of these cases, there is no disagreement, as I have mentioned, and, in such a situation, particularly amongst family members, the facilitation of the disbursements can be much faster.",27,315,2021-11-02-T-008-S-00315

After consultation with stakeholders, the tripartite partners have agreed to continue with this strategy and, beyond raising the retirement age to 65 by 2030, they have also agreed to raise the re-employment age to 70.",11,349,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00349
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"The proposed legislative amendments thus fully reflect the tripartite consensus on this roadmap.

2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),We do not rule out future changes to our approach. This model of constructive tripartism will ensure that we are able to adapt and respond to such needs in the decades to come.,13,351,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00351
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mr Sharael Taha, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira and Ms Mariam Jaafar have spoken on the need to ensure that employers fulfil their re-employment obligations and that re-employment offers are fair. I agree. The system has worked well thus far. Tripartite partners have agreed upon a reasonable set of guidelines, laying out employers’ and employees’ responsibilities.",14,352,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00352
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),I will just highlight a few guidelines that are more relevant to the situations that Members have raised.,15,353,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00353
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"First, early communication and discussion are critical to ensure that re-employment offers are reasonable to both parties. The Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees make clear that employers should engage employees at least six months before they reach retirement age.",16,354,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00354
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Second, on the issue of medical fitness, they should offer re-employment to eligible workers who are medically fit to perform any job within the company, not just the existing job role. Employers are also advised to presume that their senior employees are medically fit, unless there are clear reasons to believe otherwise. To Ms Ng Ling Ling’s concern, having chronic conditions alone cannot be used to justify denial of re-employment, if it does not affect their ability to perform the job.",17,355,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00355
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"The re-employment framework is designed to balance the need to enable senior workers to continue working, while giving employers sufficient flexibility so that businesses can remain nimble and sustainable. Different businesses may also face different challenges. So, we must strike a very careful balance.",18,356,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00356
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"I thank Ms Janet Ang for sharing her journey and her views towards retirement as a senior executive. Indeed, different individuals have different needs and expectations as they approach retirement. While some may want to stay on in their current roles, others may desire a job role with reduced work intensity or see themselves trying out new roles. This is why the tripartite partners have agreed that employers and employees should be given the flexibility to negotiate adjustments to the job roles, wages and benefits, as long as they are reasonable and based on factors like productivity, responsibilities, skills and the employer’s wage system.",19,357,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00357
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Notwithstanding this, the vast majority of re-employed workers continue on their existing contract or a new contract in the same job.

Let me reiterate – this is as a last resort, to help the worker tide over while he or she seeks alternative employment.",21,359,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00359
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"To Ms Nadia Samdin and Mr Patrick Tay’s queries about the sufficiency of the EAP amount, a fine balance was struck by the Tripartite Workgroup. If the EAP is too high, it may deter employers from hiring jobseekers who are approaching retirement age. If the EAP is too low, employers may too readily offer to pay the EAP. Nevertheless, the tripartite partners agreed to increase the minimum and maximum EAP amounts from 1 July 2022 onwards. This is in tandem with the growth in general wage levels.",22,360,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00360
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Ms Ng Ling Ling also asked about the success rate for conciliation of re-employment disputes.

We agree that ageism and workplace discrimination of any form have no place in Singapore. As Members have noted in their speeches, the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness, which I co-chair, is deliberating on the scope of legislation to address workplace discrimination. We are making progress in the discussions and we hope to finalise our recommendations by the first half of 2022.",24,362,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00362
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"I am glad that Members’ speeches in this House over the past two days also recognise that legislation is not a silver bullet nor a panacea. In this regard, I agree with Mr Heng Chee How, who has very wisely pointed out that strengthening the employability of our senior workers cannot start only when they are near retirement age. There is a need to invest in retraining and employment facilitation not only for our senior workers, but also for the future cohorts of senior workers. As Mr Patrick Tay has highlighted, employers play an instrumental role in this. And we are committed to providing the necessary assistance, including funding support. To Ms Nadia Samdin’s query on the extension of the Senior Employment Credit beyond 2022, we will also study it and update in due course.",25,363,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00363
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Members of the House, I have already spoken extensively on the various ways that the Government is supporting upskilling and employment opportunities for senior workers in my response to several Parliamentary Questions last month. So, today, I will just highlight the critical roles that our tripartite partners NTUC and SNEF play in this endeavour. The Company Training Committees, or CTCs, established by NTUC early this year, are making their impact felt. The CTCs bring together the employers, HR and employee representatives to identify gaps and opportunities and develop the necessary training plans to align a company’s workforce to its business transformation roadmap. This ensures that our senior workers’ training needs are correctly identified, to enable them to contribute productively for many more years to come.",26,364,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00364
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"As highlighted by Mr Sharael Taha, Mr Abdul Samad and Ms Janet Ang, it is also important for companies to have structured career planning conversations with their employees, especially for those in their 40s or 50s. This allows training needs and suitable job roles to be identified early. Employees will also be more motivated to pick up new skills if they have a clearer picture of how they fit into their companies’ future plans. We are working with both SNEF and NTUC to encourage more employers to do so.",27,365,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00365
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"There are many other areas where the tripartite partners have been working closely on, including encouraging job redesign and flexible working arrangements, which Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Sharael Taha, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Ms Nadia Samdin have raised. We encourage the tripartite partners to do more and we will continue to give our fullest support.",28,366,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00366

As mentioned by Mr Shawn Huang and Ms Yeo Wan Ling, it is also important for our workers to adopt a lifelong learning mindset. Continuing Education and Training, or CET, is just as important as pre-employment training (PET), as a means for our workers to upgrade their skills, remain relevant and keep pace with global trends and developments.",29,367,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00367

2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"First, let me reassure everyone that the Government has not suggested changing the Payout Eligibility Age. The Payout Eligibility Age, or PEA, is not linked to the retirement or re-employment age. The current PEA of 65 strikes a balance between timely access to retirement income and providing a sufficient runway for members to build up savings for retirement, especially as Singaporeans are expected to live longer. Members continue to have the option to defer the payouts for higher monthly payouts. In fact, yesterday, I shared that for every year that they defer after 65, the increase could be up to 7% more per annum.",33,371,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00371
2021-11-02-T-010,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Members will also continue to have the flexibility to make lump sum withdrawals from age 55, years before they start their monthly CPF payouts. The banker friend that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has, and I believe is likely to be as successful as Assoc Prof Lim himself, will be able to withdraw amounts well above the retirement sum at 55. This includes the $5,000 that he can withdraw unconditionally and the amounts in excess of his Basic Retirement Sum, given that he will likely own a property.",34,372,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00372

Today, Members with conditions of any kind, including auto-immune or neurological diseases, can qualify for early withdrawal of CPF savings if they are certified by a doctor as having a reduced life expectancy or being permanently unfit to work, or lacking mental capacity. These are now collectively referred to as “significant conditions”. The Bill provides for these same grounds to be prescribed in the Regulations. Therefore, there are no changes to the qualifying rules for early CPF withdrawal.",36,374,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00374

On the top-up rules and the position of givers, CPF Board will take into account Mr Louis Ng and Ms Joan Pereira’s suggestions. I do believe that Singaporeans top up their loved ones’ CPF accounts out of the generosity of their hearts and to help boost their loved ones' retirement adequacy.

And if notice is not sufficient, payment in lieu can be made in accordance with that clause.",2,395,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00395

Firstly, as I have said in my speech, I am not here to encourage people to work to their last breath. Has MOM done a study on how many of those actually choose to retire early, maybe because of age or they just want to retire early? Hence, can they actually ask for their CPF payouts to be at an earlier age compared to 65? That was the main gist of me requesting for the Ministry to explore the possibility if someone decides to retire before the legislative age because they want to do something personal. To them, it is their money and they are also requesting whether they can get part of the share.",2,402,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00402

In the Retirement Account, he is expected to have the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), which I believe is pegged at $93,000 today. If his property is pledged – and I believe the majority of Singaporeans today would have a property and it is pledged to the CPF – he can withdraw not just the $5,000 at the age of 55, he can also withdraw a sum higher than the $5,000 from his Special Account and his Ordinary Account. That is what is current today.",2,404,2021-11-02-T-010-S-00404

2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"The Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) Act, Electricity Act and Gas Act underpin the energy market structure and regulatory framework we have today. The EMA Act charges EMA with the duty to create a market framework for electricity and gas, promote fair and efficient market conduct, protect the interests of consumers and the public in electricity and gas supply and promote the efficient use of energy utilities. The Electricity and Gas Acts establish the regulatory regimes to ensure competitive, secure and reliable electricity and gas supply to the industry and the public.",2,422,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00422
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Yesterday, I spoke about the pre-emptive measures that EMA will be taking to safeguard Singapore’s energy security in the near term to address the recent supply crunch and volatility in global energy markets. However, energy security is not just about ensuring the robustness of our current energy supply. It is also about looking into our energy future.",3,423,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00423
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"With the power sector accounting for about 40% of Singapore’s carbon emissions, decarbonising the power sector is a key pillar of our efforts to combat climate change. MTI and EMA have embarked on a multi-decade programme to decarbonise our power sector. We will need to make a shift on many aspects – reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, maximising solar deployment, working with our regional partners to develop renewable energy sources and developing new low-carbon alternatives.",4,424,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00424
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),We should not underestimate how challenging this journey will be.

2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Safeguarding energy security and reliability – first, I will speak on our amendments to ensure that we have a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity which is critical to Singapore’s survival.",11,431,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00431
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Today, we rely on the private sector to provide sufficient generation capacity and the critical infrastructure needed for energy security and system stability. This ensures market discipline and cost effectiveness. However, the global energy transition introduces various risks and uncertainties in energy markets. For example, it is unclear when new energy solutions, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage may become cost-viable for large-scale deployment. It is also unclear how natural gas may feature in the future global energy mix.",12,432,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00432
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"These uncertainties may inhibit private investments. For example, generation companies may not be willing to invest in new generation capacity to replace older retiring generation units. They may also not be willing to invest in new technologies that incorporate cleaner fuel. Banks may be increasingly reluctant to finance generation projects which are needed but are not based on renewable energy.",13,433,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00433
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"To safeguard energy reliability and security during the energy transition, we must give EMA the option to step in and provide the critical infrastructure and services needed to ensure the proper functioning of the energy sector.",14,434,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00434
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"The first key amendment, therefore, amends section 3 of the Electricity Act and the Second Schedule of the EMA Act, to empower and enable EMA to acquire, build, own and/or operate critical infrastructure. Examples of such infrastructure would be generating units, energy storage solutions and transmission infrastructure, including those that may be required for cross-border electricity trading.",15,435,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00435
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"This will allow EMA to provide the required critical infrastructure when there is a need to do so. One example is the Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT). OCGTs are quick response units that can be brought online quickly to augment any shortfall in generation capacity, such as when there are unplanned outages among other generation units. These quick response units are necessary for the security and reliability of our electricity system. However, there is little private sector interest to build these units as they are less competitive compared to the Combined Cycle Gas Turbines. The existing OCGTs in Singapore are more than 30 years old and they are long overdue for replacement. EMA could step in to build new OCGTs.",16,436,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00436
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Where needed, EMA may directly operate the critical infrastructure or set up a subsidiary to do so. Should EMA or its subsidiary operate the critical infrastructure, operational Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, similar to the regulatory requirements that licensees are subjected to today, will be imposed, in lieu of licensing requirements. The Bill also expands EMA’s borrowing powers in the EMA Act to allow EMA to issue bonds, in addition to borrowing through commercial or Government loans, to finance the construction of these critical infrastructure.",17,437,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00437
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mr Speaker, in moving this amendment, I am mindful that the powers to acquire, build, own and/or operate critical infrastructure are broad and can affect the commercial considerations of the stakeholders in the power sector. In EMA’s industry consultations, power generation companies were concerned that the units that would be owned and operated by EMA would compete with their units in the wholesale electricity market and depress wholesale electricity prices. There were also concerns that EMA would act as both regulator and owner/operator of the generation unit. These are valid considerations. Allow me to address them.",18,438,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00438
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"First, this amendment is worded broadly to provide EMA with the flexibility to react to the wide range of scenarios which may undermine the security, stability and reliability of our energy sector. Our preference is for the private sector to build, own and operate the electricity infrastructure. I would like to assure this House that before exercising this power, EMA would have explored alternative solutions to provide the critical infrastructure that is needed.",19,439,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00439
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Second, EMA will be putting in place safeguards to ensure that they do not compete unfairly against the private generation companies. For example, EMA may set up a separate subsidiary to own and operate a generating unit and will put in place proper procedures and governance structures to mitigate any conflict of interests.",20,440,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00440
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"The second key amendment updates the Electricity Act and the Gas Act to make it an offence to damage any infrastructure housing or intended to house any transmission electricity cables, gas transmission pipeline or submarine gas pipeline in the territorial waters of Singapore. This is needed to enhance protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure.",21,441,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00441
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Currently, sections 80 and 85 of the Electricity Act, and sections 32, 32A and 32B of the Gas Act, only penalise offenders who damage the actual cables and pipelines. However, as the infrastructure housing these cables are an important part of the transmission network, EMA will be expanding the scope of the offences in these sections to cover such protective infrastructure as well. The offences carry the same penalties as those for damaging the actual cables and pipelines.",22,442,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00442
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"Moving on to the third amendment, the third key amendment empowers EMA to enhance the carbon efficiency of parties licensed under the Electricity Act. Currently, around 95% of our electricity is generated using natural gas, which is the cleanest form of fossil fuel. Even as we ramp up various sources of low carbon energy, such as solar energy and tap on regional power grids for low carbon energy, natural gas will remain an important source of energy for us over the next few decades. To reduce the carbon footprint of electricity generation, it is important that we gradually shift towards cleaner and more efficient modes of power generation.",23,443,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00443
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"The Bill expands EMA's regulatory functions under the Electricity Act to include implementing policies and strategies connected with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the import, export, generation, transmission or supply of electricity. Under clause 3(k), these policies and strategies may be imposed on licensees through Codes of Practices.",24,444,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00444
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"This move towards a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is part of a larger effort to shape a more energy- and carbon-efficient power sector. Since 2018, EMA has rolled out incentive schemes, such as the Energy Efficiency Grant for Power Generation Companies, to encourage power generation companies to improve energy efficiency. To date, more than half of the larger generation companies have tapped on the grant to make improvements to their generation units. However, as low carbon technology matures and becomes more cost-competitive, it is timely and necessary for the sector to move beyond incentives and grants and to empower EMA to regulate on this front.",25,445,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00445
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),EMA will work with the industry to develop reasonable standards and provide a transition period for existing generation units as needed.,26,446,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00446
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"This amendment will also complement ongoing economy-wide initiatives to lower carbon emissions, such as carbon taxes, to transition the power sector towards low carbon generation sources.",27,447,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00447
2021-11-02-T-012,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng),"The Bill also makes several miscellaneous amendments to the Electricity, Gas and EMA Acts and related amendments to the District Cooling Act.

2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Adding to the uncertainties, the imported piped natural gas from Indonesia is also disrupted, leading to EMA taking the extraordinary pre-emptive steps to establish standby fuel facilities where power generation companies or gencos can draw upon.",4,456,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00456
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Credits to MTI and EMA for also establishing the liquified natural gas (LNG) infrastructure about a decade ago to serve as a back-up source to the piped gas supply. This is most critical as, today, 95% of our electricity is generated from natural gas and, by far, still the cleanest fossil fuel to date.",5,457,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00457
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Beyond the current energy woes, the longer-term challenge for Singapore would be how we can repower ourselves as almost all the existing natural gas-powered plants will reach the end of their shelf life and would be retired in the next one to two decades. What would be the new mix of energy sources in the future that will be both efficient and resilient and also meet our sustainability goals?",6,458,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00458
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"It is a key strategic policy decision the Government has to make and to implement. But this major transition to a more efficient, resilient and sustainable energy architecture for Singapore also requires new executive powers to effect massive industry changes and restructuring.",7,459,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00459
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Among others, this Bill empowers EMA to directly build, acquire and manage these essential electricity infrastructures, if need be, to ensure the resilience and security of our power supply. It also enables EMA to issue licences, import of electricity and issue bonds to finance these critical facilities.",8,460,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00460
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, I support giving EMA these powers to ensure that the country will be reliably powered. This is of paramount importance. In situations of crisis or significant market disruption, EMA may require this delegation of authority to take necessary decisive actions. I will go further to submit that critical infrastructures like power generation which has a direct bearing on our security, economy and the well-being of our people should be a nationalised company or maybe even Temasek-linked companies.",9,461,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00461
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"This would ensure that the power generation companies would be operated and invested with our long-term national interest in mind. This is especially so for a small island economy like Singapore, where we lack the scale. Power generation infrastructures do have their useful lifespan and obsolescence.",10,462,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00462
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"It requires continuous long-term investments to renew, repower and invest in new capacities to meet our growth demands. There is now also the added sustainability emphasis as well as the need for further resiliency to be built into our future energy supply. Whilst doing all the above, we also want to ensure that electricity prices stay affordable to consumers and to businesses.",11,463,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00463
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"All these requirements and often competing needs may not be best served by commercially-run business enterprises. Having these infrastructures largely owned and operated by, say, foreign commercial entities, may leave us exposed to potential disruptions should the parent head offices or other subsidiaries of these companies run into problems or that they have no plans to reinvest and merely want to sit out the legacy investment till it is fully depreciated.",12,464,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00464
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Of course, the Government can regulate to require the gencos to close the line, but we know that too much of regulations and directives can actually kill the enterprising spirit and defeat the purpose.",13,465,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00465
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The other steep challenge faced by power generation companies is the ability of the company to fund the long-term capital expenditure needed to renew and to grow the capacity. Not all companies are able to raise long-term capital which can stretch more than 10 years or 20 years, at a reasonable cost. The commercial returns from the generators may not be adequate to service such long-term debts which also come with project risks and, therefore, higher risk premiums.",14,466,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00466

2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"This is needed to facilitate the decarbonisation of our gencos and, importantly, it signals the way forward in how we generate electricity. Besides enabling EMA to push for carbon-efficient technologies through this Bill, there are also the upcoming carbon taxes to incentivise the reduction of carbon emissions.",17,469,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00469
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In recent years, we have seen more forward-looking businesses incorporating sustainability into their corporate agenda.

2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"With the progressive build-up of the four supply ""switches"" and the diversification of the various energy sources, the regulations and the development of the sector would also need a more differentiated approach.",19,471,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00471
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, as this Bill is also about resilience, can I use this opportunity to seek a progress update from the Minister on the alternative sources of energy that EMA is developing? In particular, whether hydrogen, which has been quite talked about, can be a viable source or game changer for Singapore energy supply; and also, what would be the likely timeline?",20,472,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00472
2021-11-02-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, my final point is on the transition risks as we journey towards the new landscape.

2021-11-02-T-012,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member),"Many generation companies across the globe are only now shifting from coal and oil to natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind, solar and hydropower. Singapore, as a small city state with little natural resources and renewable energy options, has always had to rely on fuel imports to meet our energy demand. We had, in the early 2000s, made the shift from oil to natural gas to power our electricity generators. This was a big shift for us as a nation, as natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. The adoption of natural gas has helped Singapore manage our carbon emissions since the switch.",10,530,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00530

EMA has never failed to provide the necessary support and guidance on matters that relate to the business outlook that will directly affect the workforce both in the current moment and also preparing for the future. It is at such meetings that UPAGE was informed of this transition journey that will be undertaken by the Government to decarbonise the power grid while meeting our economy's and social energy demand via tapping on four switches, or energy supply sources, as was also announced at the 2019 Singapore International Energy Week.",11,531,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00531

During the circuit breaker last year, this group of workers were either out in the hot sun or humid conditions inside the plants and stations to ensure that businesses and consumers can have a continuous and uninterrupted supply. I hope we do not just feel upset when the tariff rates go up, but do also bear in mind the efforts of the workers that ensure our electricity and gas reach us at home.",15,535,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00535

2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. The world is gripped by an energy crisis. The demand for natural gas has remained at multi-year highs with no clear signs of easing; the same applies for fossil fuels. With 95% of Singapore's electricity generated by natural gas, our electricity market is bearing the full brunt of this energy crunch. Electricity prices were highly volatile. The Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) recorded extremely volatile intra-day figures in the past month. This has also forced several electricity retailers out of the Open Electricity Market (OEM), so it is quite timely for us to discuss this Bill of resilience.",1,539,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00539
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),This Bill allows the Ministry and EMA to robustly safeguard Singapore's energy security and resilience. The amendments effect this in two ways.,2,540,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00540
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, to enable EMA to acquire, build, own and/or operate critical infrastructure. Second, to empower EMA to require licensees to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. I will address these in turn.",3,541,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00541
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, high capex and the great energy transition have diminished investors' appetite to invest in gencos, at least in the short term. Therefore, EMA must be able to address failures in the private electricity market. The proposed amendment to empower EMA to acquire, build and own this critical infrastructure will ensure that this energy supply remains resilient.",4,542,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00542
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"However, it is not without concerns. There are concerns that the EMA would potentially act both as a regulator and owner or operator of generation units. The Ministry has reiterated its commitment to ensure a competitive wholesale electricity market. I seek the Minister's clarification on the proper governance structures to mitigate against potential conflicts of interest.",5,543,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00543
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, on empowering EMA to impose requirements to reduce GHG emissions. I have spoken in this House on how critical it is to curb climate change on a few occasions. We must reduce GHG emissions to the greatest extent possible. There is no time to waste. Emissions in Singapore are largely dominated by the energy sector. It accounts for 38% of the nation's carbon emissions in 2018. Thus, to help in combatting climate change, we must lower carbon emissions by promoting energy efficiency within the energy sector.",6,544,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00544
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The proposed amendment enables EMA, with more tools, to reduce GHG emissions. For example, it can introduce policies to decarbonise electricity generation and mandate the uptake of cleaner technologies.",7,545,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00545
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, could the Ministry clarify if EMA's efforts to reduce GHG emissions would necessarily translate into higher business costs for companies? If so, what are the scale and extent? And, in turn, does it also mean higher electricity tariffs for consumers? If so, what is the longer-term strategy to soften this impact for consumers and businesses, especially the SMEs and lower-income households?",8,546,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00546
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, the existing Energy Efficiency Grant for Power Generation Companies or gencos disburses grants of up to 50% of qualifying costs for gencos to invest in energy-efficient technologies. In 2020, three gencos were awarded a total of $23 million for energy-efficient projects. These projects would translate into taking about 9,200 vehicles off the roads annually.",9,547,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00547
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"However, my concern is that gencos might be constrained by the new policies while grappling with high price volatility. High price volatility makes it difficult for them to forecast revenue streams and apportion funds to adopt greener technology. The quantum of the grant might be insufficient to beef up the genco's appetite to do so.",10,548,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00548
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"We need to further incentivise and support gencos to switch to greener technologies. Clearly, increasing the quantum of the grant is one way but not the only one. We can also introduce flexibility tied to energy price trends. This can allow the companies to plan and manage their cashflows better.",11,549,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00549
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, on the OEM, it was introduced in 2018 and many consumers benefited from competitive pricing and innovative offers. However, the price of natural gas in 2018 was half of what it is today. Analysts have suggested that the recent exits from the OEM can be attributed to the high number of retailers in the OEM market. This makes them less able to reap economies of scale. It also makes it more difficult for retailers to build up financial reserves, reducing their ability to weather negative market conditions.",12,550,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00550
2021-11-02-T-012,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The global energy crunch will persist for some time. The volatility will only be worsened by the shifting of investment to renewables and cleaner energy sources. Could the Ministry share on its plans to support these OEMs while developing a more sustainable longer-term framework? Perhaps, there is scope to reduce the number of approved retailers to avoid disruptions to consumers.",13,551,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00551

The district cooling system is one innovative and practical example. It is an underground centralised cooling and heating system for air-conditioning of buildings. With district cooling, building owners need not invest in having their own chillers, thereby removing capital expenditure. Currently, we have one at Marina Bay that is managed by SP Group and another in the upcoming Tengah development.",8,573,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00573

This system effectively shifts the electric load requirements and optimises energy consumption throughout the day by tapering any need for energy surge or sub-optimal usage of compressors. Such new innovation implementation is necessary as current split units used in residential buildings – that is, both public and private – operate in poor energy efficiency, primarily average more than 1.5 kilowatt per tonne, because they are air-cooled and, typically, also have half or less the lifecycle.",9,574,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00574

2021-11-02-T-012,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As global temperatures are set to rise, Singapore needs to fundamentally change the way we cool spaces and scale efficient cooling systems. Beyond implementing new innovations, such as district cooling systems in new developments and estates, we need to explore ways to implement such systems in mature business districts and residential estates. Beyond grants, such as the district cooling grant, we should tap on private sector innovations and financing schemes.",11,576,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00576
2021-11-02-T-012,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"For building owners who would like to convert their existing chiller plant ownership into a utility-based cooling as a service, the private sector can offer to buy over the chiller plant from building owners and sell back chilled water as a utility. This way, capital expenditure is avoided by leveraging on the private sector’s innovative financing model. This will help building owners’ cashflow to support their core businesses, especially during this tight economic situation, and make the transition to more sustainable consumption easier.",12,577,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00577

2021-11-02-T-012,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This amendment Bill addresses both the downside and limiting factors of our current energy strategy by boldly diversifying our energy sources, investing in new innovations to both optimise our energy usage and tapping on new forms of sustainable energy. Consequently, by investing in new taps, such as importing clean energy from regional grids, it will provide new growth opportunities and jobs for Singaporeans. I believe that we can reap the benefits from building a sustainable and efficient energy system that serves our national needs while enabling us to compete globally.",20,585,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00585

2021-11-02-T-012,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"I also support the move to allow EMA to raise capital and issue bonds as this protects our energy plans to a better degree from adverse market forces. Few governments can or choose to fill the infrastructure investment gap alone. With the Minister's approval, EMA will now have the ability to raise capital not just from the Government, but also any source in or outside of Singapore. I think it is important for Singaporeans to be able to participate and benefit from supporting the nation's infrastructural goals. Will preference be given to Singaporeans who would like to participate in the issuance of such an infrastructure bond? And under what conditions would EMA look to raise capital from outside of Singapore? In the event that large amounts of overseas capital are approved of and raised, will the Government make the sources of such capital public knowledge?",11,597,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00597

In this Bill, there are clarifications on the ability to draw down on electricity retailers' deposits to offset outstanding settlement payments and this move intends to protect consumer interests to reduce the amount of default costs borne by consumers in the event of insolvencies. It has been reported that at least five energy retailers have announced exits, while others have stopped taking on new customers and are considering changes to their business model. I applaud the Government for taking the prudent step of protecting consumers' interests by drawing down on these deposits. However, many of these companies have employees, too. And in these difficult circumstances, I would also like to ask if the Government will also consider ensuring that there is support for such employees from these companies who are choosing to downsize or exit.",13,599,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00599

2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It is, indeed, timely that this Bill is introduced at a time when there is turmoil in the electricity market which has resulted in licensed retailers throwing in the towel in Singapore. The price distortions disrupted the SGX electricity futures market, leaving the retailers in the cold as they could not hedge their exposure to the price volatility triggered by the rise in gas prices overseas. This certainly highlights the importance of Singapore ensuring that it has a strong infrastructure in place as part of our energy security.",2,603,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00603
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Much has been said about going environmentally friendly and the power generation sector is certainly one big bloc. Decarbonising electricity generation is important and the gencos need to move from fossil fuel to cleaner natural gas. According to the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), since 2000, the percentage of natural gas used in electricity generation rose from 19% to more than 95%.

As we know, on all fronts, costs are rising from construction, manufacturing to transportation, logistics and manpower. We have to also bear in mind that, in the near future, we would be having higher GST and other taxes to add to the cost of generating electricity.",4,605,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00605
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Bill highlights the strategic move for Singapore to look at imports as the most viable option for decarbonising the power generation sector in the near to medium term. We are already importing all our energy supplies. As we are told by the EMA statement recently, the sharp rise in Singapore's spot electricity prices amid a global power crunch was exacerbated by a reduction in gas supply from Indonesia. Natural gas supply to Singapore from Indonesia has not fully recovered from disruptions in July, according to a news report on 18 October.",5,606,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00606
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We will have to diversify our sources of energy and importing solar power supply from Australia-Asia Power Link (AAPowerLink) is one option on the table. Another is to tap on electricity from Malaysia which is to kick-start a two-year trial starting next year to diversify the country’s energy supply. We are also part of the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project that is known as a “pathfinder” to a broader ASEAN power grid system. This will be just somewhat similar to Britain, which imports hydropower from Norway, helping to ensure secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supplies for UK consumers. Nordic power exchange, Nord Pool, held its first auction in September 2021 to trade electricity on a newly launched interconnector between Norway and Britain as both markets grapple with tight energy supplies.",6,607,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00607
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, this Bill provides further enhancements to the role that EMA plays going forward and with extra powers. My first question is  in our outreach to the regional supply source and where subsea cables are needed to connect with Singapore, what does it mean for our energy infrastructure demands going forward? How will the evolution of technology in energy infrastructure affect us and, if needed, how much would it cost in terms of actual infrastructure and human capital requirements and where would these increased landing points be located as it comes in into Singapore? And with the need to invest in capital for the cables and the landing stations, how much more would these add to the cost for consumers, whether it is private or public built? What can our Government do to mitigate the higher cost going forward, maybe a few decades down the road?",7,608,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00608
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, could the Minister share with the House how do we ensure the reliability of the energy supply from these external sources? In recent times, we have seen how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations in some countries. So, we need to think of contingencies so that we are not caught off-guard.",8,609,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00609
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, in fact, on 15 October, EMA said Singapore's power utilities might have to switch to using LNG because of the reduction in piped gas supplies from Indonesia. The resultant effect caused spot electricity futures on SGX to spike on those days. This also prompted the operator of the LNG terminal, Singapore LNG Corp, to look into boosting gas inventory to bolster energy supplies. We need to learn from this and look at how to manage such a scenario.",9,610,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00610
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Another question is  if we are going to build a back-up capacity, how long can it last and do we have multiple sources for this back-up? How do we ensure, if one supply source is disrupted, the other external sources could still keep the supply flowing? I think some Members in the House mentioned this earlier, but it highlights the point that, besides diversity, we need to ensure that our external source supplies actually do not get disrupted significantly, even after diversification. For example, the natural gas supply to Singapore from Indonesia was disrupted in July and, as of October, the supply has not fully recovered. The July disruptions were blamed mainly on an unplanned shutdown at the Anoa field and planned maintenance at the Gajah Baru field, both located in Natuna, according to a report. Production in Natuna is down 27.5% from its previous peak to 370 million standard cubic feet per day.",10,611,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00611
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"EMA had also said that the disruptions in supply from Indonesia's gas fields in Natuna had contributed to a spike in our spot electricity prices. ""The recent spike could be attributed to a number of factors, including higher than usual electricity demand, the outage of several generation units, curtailments of gas from West Natuna, as well as low landing pressure of the gas supplied from South Sumatra,"" EMA reportedly said.",11,612,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00612
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In fact, in February 2020, the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry of Indonesia said it would stop gas shipments to Singapore in the next three years to cater to domestic demand. ""Gas exports to Singapore will stop in 2023 and we will use the gas for the domestic market”, Downstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency (BPH Migas) head Fanshurullah Asa said, as quoted from the ministry’s press release. Indonesia's gas exports to Singapore come from the Corridor Block, which has a supply of 300 million standard cubic feet per day. The gas supply will be channelled into the Dumai Duri transmission pipeline to be distributed to industrial estates in Sumatra, namely, the Sei Mangkei Special Economic Zone in North Sumatra, among other destinations.",12,613,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00613
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Our supply from Malaysia is also another uncertainty. The 18-year deal for delivery of natural gas was expected to start from mid-2006 via a new five-kilometre pipeline linking Petronas’ Peninsular Gas Utilisation Pipeline to the Singapore Gas Transmission System. There is no guarantee that the expiring contract will be renewed.,13,614,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00614
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I believe, hence, we are moving to LNG as the alternative to fill the vacuum. This is where new offshore terminals will also add Singapore to a growing list of Asian countries deploying floating infrastructure. Can the Minister give the House an update on this undertaking and how are we coping with these LNG alternatives? When would LNG likely replace our demand for natural gas for use by gencos? And what steps are in place to avoid a worst-case scenario? Would it result in any supply shortage that may necessitate a back-out of supply to households?",14,615,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00615
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"At this point, if I could resurface the question whether we should consider using nuclear energy as part of our energy resilience, not within the confines of Singapore, but probably from far afield, for example. This idea is not new and our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 2008 had said that he had once considered tapping nuclear energy as the best alternative to fossil fuels for Singapore. Can the Minister share his thoughts on this, please?",15,616,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00616
2021-11-02-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, the Bill empowers EMA to acquire, build, own and operate critical infrastructure, including generation capacity. May I ask how EMA would play its role if it is a genco, wholesaler and regulator? Would this not open it to a conflict of interest? I think it would be useful if the Minister can share on this point. This would only cause the electricity market not to be a level playing field for all participants, if you interpret it from a conflict-of-interest perspective.",16,617,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00617

2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I thank MTI for conducting a public consultation for this Bill and publishing a public response to inputs received. I hope we will continue this good practice of gathering and responding to public feedback for legislative amendments.,3,622,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00622
2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three points of clarification to make.,4,623,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00623
2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification relates to the expansion of borrowing powers. Clause 2(a) of the Bill expands the powers of EMA. With this change, EMA can now raise loans and grant charges over EMA’s property. I understand that the goal is to ensure energy security by freeing EMA to fund its construction of critical energy infrastructure. However, it seems like this change also opens a gap in our energy security. After all, borrowing from foreign financiers may also mean granting them rights and interests over parts of our energy infrastructure. Can the Minister share in what circumstances would such foreign funding be approved by the Government? What safeguards would the Ministry implement to limit the risks of foreign funding to our energy infrastructure?",5,624,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00624
2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification is on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In its response to feedback from the public consultation, MTI said that EMA would use its new powers under this law to develop “further targeted measures” that would reduce the power generation sector’s emissions. Can the Minister share EMA’s timeline for consulting the sector and for releasing new standards and policies? Put simply, we are already behind schedule. The latest IPCC report on climate change stresses that there is only a small window of opportunity left for countries to keep the 2050 temperature increase below two degree Celsius. Power generators will need time to adapt to any new regulations. Will the Ministry commit to setting an aggressive timeline for releasing EMA’s new policies?",6,625,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00625
2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition to sharing its timeline, will the Ministry proactively share with the public the expected emissions impact of any new power generation? After all, as Minister Grace Fu mentioned this year, the Green Plan is a living plan, designed and executed in collaboration with our people. Let us empower members of the public to understand and support policies that will help Singapore reach its climate goals.",7,626,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00626

2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"There have been many more of such attacks. We must be proactive and aggressive in closing any cybersecurity gaps in our energy infrastructure. To this end, I have three questions.",10,629,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00629
2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, can the Government share how many cyber attacks have our energy and water infrastructure faced in recent years? I am talking about entities across the entire supply chain, including gas pipelines, generation plants, energy retailers and more. If the Government is not able to share the specific number, can it at least confirm whether attempts at an attack have taken place?",11,630,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00630

2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, will the Government update our laws to ensure high cybersecurity standards in our energy and utilities sector specifically? Minister Josephine Teo said in October that the Government has been reviewing our cybersecurity laws. I hope that this review will consider new regulations specifically for our water supply and energy supply systems.",13,632,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00632
2021-11-02-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, does the Government have plans for dealing with a successful cyber attack on our energy and water infrastructure? Are there clear actions that would be taken on emergency supplies and crisis communications? After all, we can do our best to build defences, but we should not pretend that a successful attack will never happen. When it does happen, we must have contingency plans to address the unrest and emergencies that would emerge. Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",14,633,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00633

To enhance Singapore’s energy resilience in the longer term, it is important for us to look at it holistically from the entire value chain. We have existing assets and infrastructures that span this value chain today. But our challenge remains with the strong need for importation of energy sources. I would thus like to ask which aspect will our resiliency measures moving forward be focused on  raw material sources, including green options, energy generation, the grid distribution that supports low-carbon electricity or better balancing of power allocation and usage between industries and consumers?",4,637,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00637

2021-11-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Given our limited land and rooftop spaces, there is a practical limit to how much we can harness from solar energy within our shores. It is thus imperative that we look further to explore importation of renewable energy sources from other countries through regional grids. However, in the race to decarbonise each economy, neighbouring countries would have their own domestic carbon reduction commitments to achieve in the near term and may not be as forthcoming towards sale of these electricity sources to us.",6,639,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00639
2021-11-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Just this month, Malaysia’s Energy and Natural Resources Ministry announced that only non-renewable energy is allowed to be exported to Singapore, and power sales through self-developed transmission and interconnection facilities to Singapore will not be allowed. Apart from Malaysia, I believe we may encounter similar situations with others. How then would we prepare to overcome this if Singapore’s ability to import renewable sources are limited by export measures set by other countries’ domestic considerations? Could the Ministry share whether this change in stance from Malaysia has any impact on the trial project of the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP)?",7,640,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00640
2021-11-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"It appears that continuing to import natural gas to fulfil our usage is inevitable.

2021-11-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"In my view, establishing the ground infrastructure and having a detailed transition plan to accommodate the future combination of low carbon or green fuels in our energy generation and distribution system are fundamental. These infrastructure projects are extremely costly and the appropriate choice of technology selected at any point will give rise to future impact on sufficiency in supply while also having to meet the evolving and higher bars of climate change goals.",9,642,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00642
2021-11-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"On this note, I would like to ask the Minister in the case that we switch to lower carbon sources, for example, hydrogen, this would mean some changes are required for the pipelines and electricity grids. There is also a likelihood for more public-private partnership to involve the local players and overseas companies with the expertise to enable adoption of microgrid supplies as we transition to prevent any disruption. May I know what are the expectations and parameters in which Singapore may likely adopt or move towards such changes?",10,643,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00643

Having said that, I belong to the school of thought that we should pursue this aspiration and continue to strengthen our ability to support these industries as they set foot on our shore. However, I feel that the path to evolve is one where the industry players and businesses here must take an active role in shaping and contributing their share of reducing energy needs and, concurrently, using technologies to enable adaptation of their facilities for usage of greener energy sources or to decarbonise existing infrastructures.",12,645,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00645

If not, will further actions be taken to address them so as to ensure balanced stability in energy consumption over time?",13,646,2021-11-02-T-012-S-00646
2021-11-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Moving on, let me raise the point about consumption pattern and energy allocation of power supply. As a resource-constrained nation, we are resigned to the fact about our predominant need for energy imports. Yet, I believe it is ever so important for us to be more intentional and conscious with regard to our energy usage and allocation. As a manufacturing hub for higher value-add technologies and digitalisation, some services like data centres, foundries and green fuels will bring benefits to our broader ecosystem.

2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, it is important to safeguard our heritage for the benefit of future generations of Singaporeans. This Bill sends a clear signal on the importance of our heritage sites and gives the authorities the tools they need to protect these sites.",1,776,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00776
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three points of clarification to make.,2,777,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00777
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is about the punishment for those who damage our monuments. The new section 15 provides some leniency to those who damage or alter our monuments. One situation is when a person acts in good faith to comply with a Government order or requirement.,3,778,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00778
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I welcome this amendment. It would be unfair to punish someone who acts in good faith and is complying with a Government order.,4,779,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00779
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the spirit of providing effective deterrence against people damaging our monuments, could I also suggest that MCCY work with monument owners to ensure there are clear signs and labels to inform members of the public when they come across a monument?",5,780,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00780
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The list of gazetted monuments is long. I am sure that many members of the public have no idea even when they are in or around a national monument. This will especially be the case as we expand the definition and start gazetting less concrete things like bodies of water and plots of land. Deterrence works best when expectations are clear, after all.",6,781,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00781
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is about clearer definitions. I agree with the existing defence in section 15(8) being retained. A person will not be liable for a section 15(4) offence if he had acted because of a person’s or property’s safety and had exercised all reasonable care to ensure that the act or omission would have no more effect on the “character or appearance” of the monument than was “necessary in the circumstances”.,7,782,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00782
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify whether there are any guidelines or subsidiary legislation in determining how a monument’s “character or appearance” is affected?,8,783,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00783
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"As something that seems quite subjective, it would be useful to have some factors for consideration. Similarly, can the Minister also provide some examples of what may be considered “necessary in the circumstances” and whether there is a legal or factual threshold to be met?",9,784,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00784
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final point is about conditions for a warrantless entry. With the new section 27, a Director or a Monument Inspector will have the power to forcibly enter any land or site without warrant if certain conditions are fulfilled.",10,785,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00785
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I agree with the Director and Inspector having stronger enforcement powers and understand that there could be certain situations where taking enforcement action can be urgent. However, I note that time sensitivity is not one of the conditions that have to be met for the Director or Inspector to enter the premises without a warrant. Can the Minister clarify why this is the case?",11,786,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00786
2021-11-02-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If the enforcement action is not urgent and no monuments are in immediate danger, I do not see why the Director or Inspector should not apply for a warrant before entering the premises. This will ensure that proper process is followed and reduce the likelihood of allegations of improper misconduct made against the enforcers. Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",12,787,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00787

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I note with particular concern that section 27(2A) will enable the Monument Inspector to “forcibly enter” the site “without warrant” when they suspect on reasonable grounds that the site is being defaced, damaged or interfered with, “including by breaking open any outer or inner door or window”. I urge careful reconsideration. How is such violent action consistent with protecting our monuments? Such actions could damage the very monuments they are intended to protect.",7,794,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00794
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"While I do agree with the thrust of the Bill to increase protection powers for these sites, I believe the law needs to be more balanced and should not encroach on the rights of monument owners and occupiers, especially at the risk of damaging the actual monuments, unless absolutely necessary. I repeat the Workers’ Party’s position from the debate on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, or FICA, that exceptional Executive power must be matched with strong judicial oversight.",8,795,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00795
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I have two specific questions to ask. Firstly, in what circumstances will the Monument Inspector deem it of such necessity to forcibly enter the site that the accompanying potential damage to the site’s windows and doors is justified? Can the Minister give some examples?",9,796,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00796
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, in the 51 years of existence of the Preservation of Monuments Act, has the Government ever seen the need for forced entry without warrant into a monument or proposed monument to protect the site for the same reasons that confer such powers in the Bill?",10,797,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00797
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to suggest a circumscribing of the powers of forced entry without warrant by bringing in judicial oversight, unless in particularly exigent situations. The existing section 21 of the Preservation of Monuments Act already provides that the Director or a Monument Inspector may apply to the High Court, quote, “for any actual or apprehended contravention of the provisions of this Act to be restrained by injunction”, unquote.",11,798,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00798
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In urgent cases, it is possible to obtain a temporary injunction from the High Court within days.

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Hence, I propose to circumscribe the powers of forced entry without warrant to the following situations  firstly, non-compliance of the owner with an injunction issued under section 21; or, secondly, where there is reason to believe, on balance of probability considerations, that irreparable damage to the site will happen before an injunction order can be obtained.",13,800,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00800
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I note, however, that in urgent cases, it is possible to obtain an injunction order fairly quickly. I would welcome the Minister’s assurances on the substance of these proposals.",14,801,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00801
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the Hong Kong and UK equivalents of this provision, there are stronger checks and balances than what is proposed here. Hong Kong’s Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance, section 5, also provides for public officials to have such powers of entry to inspect monuments. For entry into residential sites, written consent must be obtained from the occupier, or the Authority must give not less than 48 hours' written notice of their intention to enter. Furthermore, section 22(2)(b) of this Ordinance reads, quote, “no regulations made under this Ordinance shall confer upon a person any right which he would not otherwise have had to enter upon private land"", unquote. This is from Hong Kong.",15,802,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00802
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The UK’s Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act, section 88, also allows for forced entry into recognised heritage sites, but only with a magistrate’s warrant. According to guidance notes by the UK Institute of Historic Building Conservation, forced entry with a warrant, quote, “should be seen as a last resort”, unquote. And I quote, “To convince the Magistrates that forced entry is necessary, the planning authority needs to show what steps have already been taken to gain access by agreement and why these have failed"", unquote.",16,803,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00803

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I note the Government’s reasoning that this provision is to align the PMA with powers of forced entry under section 27 of the Planning Act for protecting conserved buildings. However, the Planning Act provision does not have any mention of forced entry without warrant. Furthermore, we should remember that other than conservation, the Planning Act also covers land use and development in a broader sense and does not perform a monument preservation function.",18,805,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00805
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, my second proposal for better protection of monument owners’ interests is to ensure the certainty of timelines in, firstly, objections made to preservation orders; and, secondly, the duration of a preservation order.",19,806,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00806
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"When the Minister makes a preservation order in relation to a monument, sections 7(b) and (c) of the PMA allow the owner or occupier to make objections and require that the Board considers these objections and makes recommendations to the Minister.",20,807,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00807
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, there is no specific timeframe on how long the Minister has to consider these objections and make the final decision on the preservation order. Given the often onerous responsibility of maintaining a proposed national monument, it would be helpful for owners and occupiers of these sites to have greater certainty on the duration of the process. And I seek assurances from the Minister on this point.",21,808,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00808
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I note that section 12 of the PMA does require that dwelling-houses that are served a preservation order be acquired by the state within a year, or the preservation order would lapse.

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Once again, it may be helpful to take a leaf from Hong Kong’s Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance, which clearly set out the process, procedures and timelines for how declarations of “proposed monuments” and objections may be made. Section 2B of the Ordinance provides that the declaration of a “proposed monument” only has effect for 12 months. Section 2C of the Ordinance provides that if the proposed monument is within private land, the owner or occupier may at any time apply to the Authority for withdrawal of the declaration. The Authority has to consider such objections within one month of the objection. If unsuccessful, the owner or occupier can pursue their objections further with the Chief Executive and Chief Executive in Council. The clear and transparent statutory timelines provide certainty for all stakeholders.",23,810,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00810

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"As it stands, the process for making, amending or revoking a preservation order appears, by law, to be one solely between the owner and occupier of a monument and the authorities.",26,813,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00813
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Section 11(7)(a) of the PMA provides that before the Minister makes, amends or revokes a preservation order, the Board is required to “give notice in writing of the Minister’s intention to do so to the owner and occupier of the monument and any land adjacent thereto which will be affected (by the preservation order)”. There is no legal provision or mechanism enshrined in law for members of the public or heritage groups to provide feedback or objections in this process. Such engagement seems to be up to the discretion of the Government, the kind of broad discretion that is often given to the Government in the language of many of our laws.",27,814,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00814
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"If our national monuments are sites that we, as a people, reflect upon as sources of meaning and identity, public and heritage groups must have avenues, inscribed in law, to provide feedback on whether sites should be preserved. This would enhance the public’s investment in the heritage preservation cause.",28,815,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00815
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I propose we adopt, in subsidiary legislation, the same process as the Planning (Master Plan) Rules, specifically Rule 4, which requires that a proposal for an amendment to the Master Plan (for example, to designate a site as a conservation area) be advertised by notice and made available for public inspection. Rules 5 and 6 make provisions for members of the public to submit representations and objections to the amendments and require that, if the objection is not ruled frivolous, they have to be attended to by a hearing or public inquiry by the authorities.",29,816,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00816

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, my first point on resources is in respect of the National Monuments Fund. Amendments to sections 4 and 5 of the Act extend the functions of NHB to cover “maintenance” of monuments and proposed monuments. I understand that NHB also administers the National Monuments Fund, a co-funding scheme.",31,818,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00818
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Can NHB look into expanding the list of qualifying maintenance works?

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My second point on resources is about the availability of craftsmanship expertise to restore and maintain monuments. One of our national monuments that had been gazetted early on in 1980 is Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery. In the 1990s, it fell into disrepair and was infested by termites. But the restoration and reconstruction took almost 20 years due to the difficulties in, firstly, finding local craftsmen with the necessary expertise and, secondly, bringing in foreign craftsmen.",33,820,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00820
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Singapore currently classifies heritage building maintenance and restoration under the construction industry, so, these craftsmen can only work here as foreign construction workers. However, the highly-skilled and experienced craftsmen preferred for these projects are often older and would face the age limit obstacle when applying for a work permit. Furthermore, they would only be allowed to work on a single “construction” project, and would have to leave on project completion. So, there is no one available to attend to the daily maintenance of these heritage buildings. I also note that, in recent years, it has been even harder to attract such foreign craftsmen to come here, given that the pay in Singapore may not be significantly more attractive than in their home country. Could the Ministry look into this problem more closely in collaboration with MOM and perhaps consider relaxing entry requirements for foreign craftsmen by recognising them as such, instead of seeing them as “foreign construction workers”; and allowing them to work on multiple projects while here?",34,821,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00821
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the longer term, Madam, we need to build up local expertise. Could the Ministry work with local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and architecture or construction firms to professionalise career pathways for these craftsmen or artisans of heritage sites? Could IHLs also consider incorporating practicum options for IHL students to be involved in craft work on heritage projects?",35,822,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00822
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Over the past year, I have spoken about the need to move more Singaporeans into trades jobs sustainably. It is said that many Singaporeans do not want to go into these jobs, such as highly-skilled construction workers and plumbers. To fix this problem of lack of local craftsmanship expertise, I would like to repeat my call for ensuring decent working conditions and enhancing the standing and pay of these jobs.",36,823,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00823
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, on the new section 22A, this provides exemptions from Part IV Provisions for Preservation of Monuments and may mean that the provisions of other laws will always supersede a preservation order issued under the PMA.

2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),The final concern I would like to highlight in my speech is the importance of protecting heritage in a more holistic manner so that the proposed amendments can be truly meaningful.,40,827,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00827
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I will start off by proposing the incorporation of the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) mechanism into our heritage management policies going forward. The HUL mechanism incorporates community participation in the process, especially in the mapping, identifying and categorising of historically significant monuments and sites. It would bring us towards greater “democratisation” of heritage management and protection by giving a greater voice to broader communities and all stakeholders. This mechanism was recommended by UNESCO to all member countries for urban heritage management.",41,828,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00828
2021-11-02-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, besides being preserved, historic urban spaces in Singapore need to be used more adaptively, or they run the risk of being underutilised and “lifeless.” One such space that would benefit from such adaptive reuse is the Padang. In MCCY’s press release on this Bill, the Padang had been singled out as a site that will be proposed for preservation. Despite having borne witness to key historical milestones, the Padang today is regrettably an under-utilised public place.

If the house comes under consideration for preservation, it is this very Act, the Preservation of Monuments Act, that will determine what is due process.",53,840,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00840

Given the high-profile nature of this case, how it is handled will set a precedent for future heritage decisions. This will be monumental, pun intended, for heritage management in Singapore. In relation to this case, whether the wishes of a single individual are respected in relation to the national heritage interest, how the public is consulted, how negotiations with the owner and occupier are conducted, how heritage value is assessed and evaluated, whether our heritage institutions and laws are seen to be legitimate and effective – will resonate in the years to come.",54,841,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00841

2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"That is not correct. Section 27(1A) of the Planning Act provides specifically for there to be forced entry in the scenario where the officer concerned is reasonably satisfied that there is a risk of damage to the conserved property or to the property under the Planning Act.

Section 13(7), for example, deals with failure to comply with the preservation notice. Section 15(4) is in relation to works or alterations that are being done to the monument or the proposed monument without prior permission. Section 20(1)(a) deals with non-compliance of an enforcement notice. So, in other words, there is already an enforcement notice and the officer suspects that there is a non-compliance with the enforcement notice. Section 22(1) deals with a situation where there is a defacement, damage or otherwise, an interference with the monument or the proposed monument.",15,875,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00875

So, again, every attempt is made to demonstrate that you are either unable to enter, or you have been refused entry, and these two sub-provisions that I have cited show that every effort must be made by the officer concerned to make an attempt to either speak to the owner or occupier or some other person who appears to have control of the site – and all that takes place before entering, as is explicit in both sections 27(2B)(a) and (b).",19,879,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00879

Indeed, preservation and enforcement powers help us to safeguard National Monuments, but that, in itself, is not sufficient if the public is not aware of its significance and also appreciative of its heritage value. Many of us would have noticed that several of our National Monuments have also been given a new lease of life, to borrow Mr Leon Perera's words, ""through careful, adaptive reuse"", which is a pragmatic and sustainable approach to preservation. Even though their historic façades and structures are preserved, the internal uses may evolve over time.

2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But the point about adaptive reuse is well-understood and, sometimes, it is a question of trying to balance modernising and preserving the heritage, and adaptively reusing, with imagination, to repurpose the interior, which, sometimes, can maximise preservation and also affinity with the public, who are drawn more to the premises rather than just by the façade.",34,894,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00894
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To further increase public awareness and appreciation of our national monuments, NHB also runs a slate of programmes for the public. This includes walking tours for the public, learning journeys for school children, at least in pre-pandemic times, led by volunteer guides who share stories of the history and significance of the National Monuments. There is also the Milestones Through Monuments programme, introduced in 2019, which allows the public to learn more about the history of each monument through onsite exhibits and physical installations.",35,895,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00895
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I have mentioned, COVID-19 has impeded physical programmes to an extent and also NHB's outreach efforts. NHB has also kept up engagement of Singaporeans through digital means, instead of embarking on physical learning journeys for school children. As I have mentioned, NHB offers Monumental Robo-tours. Not only for school children, Members are always welcomed to try for themselves as well. It uses a telepresence robot to create a virtual tour experience for students who can sit in the comfort of their classrooms and still get to experience virtual tours of our national historic and heritage sites.",36,896,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00896
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Other initiatives include the Music at Monuments digital programme, a series of musical performances held at National Monuments streamed online, which was released last year. And I am pleased to say – perhaps because people cannot be physically present as much as they would like to be – that it garnered more than 300,000 views, which is very encouraging.",37,897,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00897
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These digital programmes will be with us for the long term, even after the pandemic. And they will expand the menu of the offerings.

2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would just like to respond to some of the specific points that Mr Leon Perera raised, in terms of trying to strike a balance. I have explained how section 27 is designed to work, but Members will be assured to know that, as far as NHB is concerned, any damage to the heritage site will be an absolute last resort, only if necessary to have a protection of the greater site itself.",39,899,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00899
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In terms of the duration of the Notice itself, I have noted Mr Leon Perera's points and we can consider them. But one also needs to appreciate that as you look at gazetting or considering the gazetting of sites for preservation, no two sites will be the same. Some, in fact, after this amendment, will be a site, others might be a building. Some are larger, some are smaller, some have a more complex history and some require a little bit more work, as Mr Leon Perera also outlined, in terms of preserving and making sure that it is something that can be kept well.",40,900,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00900
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, we have framed it as ""a reasonable period"" in this case; that is the language of the statute. That is one way of doing it. Mr Leon Perera says, ""Why don't we follow Hong Kong?"", which says one year. But in some cases, one year is too short; in other cases, one year is too long.",41,901,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00901
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For now, it is probably best for us to look at the sites and, given the level of interactivity that NHB has with stakeholders, with owners, with occupiers, with members of the public, with the heritage groups, it is sufficient for now, I believe, to leave it as ""reasonable period"", so that there is some flexibility in their engagement. And one can also have regard to the specific context of the site in question. And it does not have to be tied to a particular period, in all cases, for all sites or all buildings.",42,902,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00902
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Leon Perera raised the point about engagement. There is no provision in the Bill that stipulates a timeline and a plan for engagement, but Mr Leon Perera probably knows that NHB conducts public engagements regularly. In fact, some were done even before this Bill was canvassed and proposed. Likewise, in other jurisdictions, including those provisions that Mr Leon Perera looked at in Hong Kong and the UK, some have, some do not have, a formal process.",43,903,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00903
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have chosen not to have a formal process hard-coded into the legislation, but that does not mean that NHB does not engage. In fact, NHB engages the heritage societies I have mentioned regularly, including NGOs, docent leaders, monument owners and occupiers regularly. And also the grant applicants, those who take grants from NHB, we engage them as our stakeholders. NHB also conducts focus group discussions and public consultations for major projects and initiatives. Our SG Heritage plan is part of that. But also for museum or heritage institution revamps, NHB does public consultations on these.",44,904,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00904
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"And as Mr Leon Perera pointed out, in these amendments in this Bill, what will happen after the Minister has formed the intention to gazette a site as a monument, that will be published. Mr Leon Perera asked if it is online and if it is free. I think if it is online it will be free and NHB intends to publish it online, so that members of the public will know in advance if something is proposed to be gazetted as a monument. That is not to say that that is the only feedback that NHB gets. It does not stop anyone with any interest from making submissions and giving feedback to NHB at any time, which has happened.",45,905,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00905
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, what the provisions do is to say that the moment something is considered and an NOI is filed in respect of that particular site or building, then that would be published and members of the public will know about it.",46,906,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00906
2021-11-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There were some questions by Members on the operation of the new section 22(a). As I have explained in my opening speech, sometimes, for a site, besides being subject to regulations or orders on preservation, how it is to be conserved, preserved and so on, there is also a question of how it is otherwise maintained by other agencies. In some cases, it may be a sewer, in other cases it may be about the maintenance of the environment. What section 22A does is to provide that these other agencies may come in and deal with their area of operations, their works, without running afoul of PMA. To Mr Leon Perera's suggestion, he should be assured that there is close collaboration between MCCY and also with NHB, together with URA, whenever there are such works that concern or touch on or impact heritage sites or buildings.",47,907,2021-11-02-T-013-S-00907

2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),MOF sought views from the public on the draft Bill earlier this year. The public consultation was conducted from 6 to 27 July 2021. MOF has published on 1 October 2021 our responses to the key feedback received.

2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We impose GST on all goods imported via land or sea, regardless of value. We also impose GST on goods imported by air or post with a value above $400. We currently do not have GST on goods imported by air or post with a value of $400 and below. This is a gap which puts local businesses at a disadvantage.",5,918,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00918
2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"To close this gap, the first set of amendments introduces GST for goods that are valued up to the current GST import relief threshold of $400, or ""low-value goods"", that are imported via air or post from 1 January 2023 onwards.",6,919,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00919

2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),The introduction of GST for low-value goods imported via air or post and for imported B2C non-digital services is necessary to ensure a level playing field for our local businesses and allow them to compete effectively. Overseas suppliers of goods and services will be subject to the same GST treatment as local suppliers. These amendments will also keep our GST system resilient in a growing digital economy.,10,923,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00923

2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Currently, the basis for determining whether a supply of media sales is zero-rated or standard-rated depends on the place of circulation of the advertisement.

2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We, therefore, need to update and revise the GST treatment of media sales. Thus, with effect from 1 January 2022, the GST treatment for the supply of media sales will instead be based on where the person who contracts for the service, for example, a local or overseas headquarters or HQ, and the person who directly benefits from the service, for example, a subsidiary in Singapore, belong.

2021-11-02-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Since then, there have been changes to our GST system. For instance, we introduced GST on imported B2B services and imported B2C digital services from 1 January 2020.

2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In the past two years, we had observed a significant increase in interest in online shopping. The borderless nature of the Internet would mean that Singaporeans also have easy access to foreign online marketplaces. Local businesses would now find themselves competing with online sellers from overseas, who are often more experienced and able to offer their goods and services at lower prices due to lower production costs and lack of taxes.",2,942,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00942
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Government’s move to apply GST to lower-value overseas imports via air is highly anticipated and welcomed by the local businesses that I have spoken with. The business owners believe reducing the cost differences between buying products locally and overseas would, to some extent, help to drive the consumer traffic inwards. But to achieve its intended purpose, the policies must be pragmatic and enforceable. With the sheer number of independent foreign merchants that offer direct shipping to Singapore, how will this policy be implemented?",3,943,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00943
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Would GST be paid to the merchant or would consumers make the payment when their purchase reaches local customs? With this additional step of GST collection on an increased number of parcels, will this slow down the delivery process significantly? How could a possible decrease in delivery service standards be mitigated, while ensuring prompt collection of taxes?",4,944,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00944
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, for digital services, the absence of customs intervention could mean a higher possibility of tax evasion. For example, if someone purchases a web design service from an independent designer overseas, is there any way for the authorities to track this transaction, besides self-declaration from the consumers? Would the Government work with international payment platforms, such as PayPal and Stripe, to better monitor the outflow of online payments from Singapore to overseas?",5,945,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00945
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Besides administrative issues, the fact that this tax on lower-cost goods would affect lower-income households is another cause for concern. Some Singaporeans buy products from overseas that they cannot find locally. They will now have to contend with significantly higher costs as a result of increasing shipping costs and GST costs and not to mention the supply chain disruptions that we are facing now. For the lower-income households, every cent in savings counts. Being driven towards local options that are initially more expensive than its foreign counterpart may be a win for the local retailer, but, for the low-income consumer, it would feel like a loss.",6,946,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00946
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"A resident of mine recently learnt to shop online after receiving training from the Seniors Go Digital Programme. She has frequent backaches and was delighted to buy a brand of ointment from Indonesia, which is not available in any of the local supermarkets. She says it is much cheaper than her usual choice of ointment and more effective. With the new policy, she lamented that she may give up using it if it becomes too costly. So, I did tell her that she could try to suggest to some of our local supermarkets to bring in the product. As I understand, our local supermarkets and retailers have been heeding the Government’s call to diversify supplies. So, I would hope that our residents do not have to feel deprived of their favourite overseas products because it has become significantly costlier to purchase overseas.",7,947,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00947
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Nonetheless, all this is happening in tandem with the scenario of a potential increase in local GST rates, which may take place by 2025. Singaporeans are still reeling from the economic impact of the pandemic. So, all these possible factors that may contribute to increased expenses may be very difficult to be taken as the normal scheme of things, even if the policy is necessary, and many countries have already implemented similar moves. A young resident tells me that he is feeling disheartened because he is still searching for a stable job after graduating, but costs of living are going up faster than he can find one.",8,948,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00948
2021-11-02-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The widespread popularity of e-commerce and foreign marketplaces in Singapore would mean that increasing GST not only impacts businesses, it also indirectly impacts Singaporeans’ costs of living. So, it is important that we address it as such. With that said, I understand that some major multinational online marketplaces, in fact, already incorporate GST into their goods and services and pay it directly to the Government. So, the number of consumers affected by the new policy may be less than expected. Can the Minister share data on how this policy may impact overall inflation and living costs in Singapore, even at the margin, especially so given the already inherent pressures and delays from supply chain disruption risks?",9,949,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00949

Back then, I shared my concerns about the loss of public revenues through GST leakages and had also asked about the status of introducing GST on imported goods, a point which was first raised in Budget 2018. I shared then that the OECD had, in March 2019, endorsed new rules and frameworks for the collection of taxes on the online sale of goods.",1,952,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00952
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Meanwhile, COVID-19 has resulted in dual impacts on the retail sector in Singapore  firstly, an acceleration in the already rapid growth of the e-commerce market; and, secondly, the continued struggle of brick-and-mortar retailers amid an uneven playing field.",2,953,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00953
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Fast forward to this year, these points continue to be relevant, with online sales now representing 16.4% of total retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, in August this year and with vacancy rates of retail space remaining elevated at 8% despite declining retail rents since 2015, given the challenges faced by the retail industry and made worse by multiple waves of COVID-19-related restrictions.",3,954,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00954
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"From the perspective of supporting our local SME retailers and to address a growing source of tax leakage due to overseas online retailers and to correct a key imbalance faced by tax-paying retailers in Singapore, I would like to state upfront that I am supportive of this Bill and the ensuing changes to ensure a level playing field for our local businesses to compete effectively.",4,955,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00955
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"A year ago, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong shared that he was very happy that I had brought up this point and supported it, because the MOF will certainly look for ways to raise more revenues and I believe the Minister will be equally happy with my discussion today. That being said, I do have a number of clarifications and broader issues to raise.",5,956,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00956
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The first is that, since 1 January last year, GST is now payable on digital services provided by the GST-registered overseas service providers. In December 2019, IRAS shared that more than 100 overseas digital service providers have registered for GST under Singapore's Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime and will be charging GST on their sales of digital services to Singapore consumers.",6,957,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00957
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In November 2018, it was shared in this House that the Government expects additional revenue of about $90 million per year from this so-called ""Netflix tax"". Incidentally, Netflix has grown its subscriber base globally by about 1.5 times from 2018 to 2020, adding 37 million subscribers globally in 2020 alone. In Singapore, Disney+ was also launched in February this year, with many other over-the-top (OTT) services, Software as a Service (SaaS) and other forms of digital services witnessing prolific growth, due to the change in consumption patterns brought about by COVID-19.",7,958,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00958
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I would like to ask the Minister  what was the assessed contributions from the tax on overseas digital services in the last financial year and how does it compare with initial estimates? More broadly, what has been MOF's initial assessment of the level of industry compliance, effectiveness of the administration of this tax and the number of cases of non-compliance by overseas vendors detected by IRAS so far?",8,959,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00959
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Second, I understand that from 1 January 2023, GST will now apply to goods imported by air or post with a value of up to S$400, as well as imported non-digital services. In both of these cases, implementation is by way of extending the Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime, similar to how GST was being extended to digital services. Under certain conditions, a local or overseas operator of electronic marketplaces may also be regarded as the supplier of such low-value goods or imported services.",9,960,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00960
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"With the likes of Shopee and Lazada being the e-commerce marketplaces with the largest estimated market share here in Singapore and with these companies themselves being headquartered in Singapore, the focus on these popular electronic marketplaces and digital platforms does provide for an effective way to ensure tax compliance and proper GST collection. However, now that we are venturing into the realm of low-value goods, a significantly larger plethora of overseas businesses are now supposed to be GST-registered.",10,961,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00961
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"But the reality is that not all of them may be aware of this requirement and, even if they do, could simply decide not to go through this hassle to collect GST on the Singapore Government's behalf. A quick search on the IRAS GST Registered Business Search throws up four records for Shopee, five records for Lazada, 20 for Amazon but none for Taobao, by far the most dominant marketplace in China, for example. There could also be many more direct overseas vendors that may or may not be registered as well.",11,962,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00962
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"How then can IRAS ensure that there is a robust enforcement framework in place, to ensure that all those who fall within the scope of the OVR regime do so? In the absence of financial records of companies incorporated overseas, much less the amount of revenues they derive from Singapore specifically, how does IRAS make the determination as to which companies it seeks to audit or investigate? And whether the overseas tax authorities will be able to provide as comprehensive an information set that IRAS seeks to retrieve?",12,963,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00963
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The third point is in relation to one of tax efficiency and IRAS has been an efficient tax authority, a consistently low cost of tax collection at less than one cent per dollar of tax collected over the past years. I recognise that this new Bill is also about protecting Singapore's revenue base, not just merely about the additional GST receipts from the imposition of GST on these categories of goods and services.",13,964,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00964
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),But how much does the Government expect to collect in GST receipts from each of the low-value goods and imported non-digital services? And what is the cost of tax collection in this regard and the expected level of resources and costs to ensure a comprehensive compliance and enforcement framework?,14,965,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00965
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The fourth point is more of an adjacent one and while Singaporeans may not be able to travel overseas as freely as we would like to right now, we do yearn for the skies one day. As and when we do travel overseas, it is to be expected that one might be doing some shopping and bring home some gifts and souvenirs. Today, travellers are granted GST import relief on new goods that are purchased overseas and brought into Singapore for their personal use, with the relief amount set at $500 with 48 hours spent away from Singapore. Can I ask the Minister if this GST relief is expected to stay intact even when GST on low-value goods is in place from 2023?",15,966,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00966
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Before I end, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak about a number of broader but pertinent issues relating to GST.",16,967,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00967
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The first is on the spectre of a looming GST hike from 7% to 9% amid current macroeconomic uncertainties. The Workers' Party has been voicing our concerns on the GST hike since it was announced in 2018 and I take comfort that Member Mr Yip Hon Weng also shared his concern on the impending GST hike, where he pointed out in his speech on the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill last month, that this was originally announced before the pandemic. To which, Minister Lawrence Wong responded that, ""The Government has announced that the GST rate increase will take place sometime during 2022 to 2025. This remains unchanged and we will continue to consider all factors, including our fiscal needs as well as the prevailing economic conditions in deciding on the timing of the GST rate increase.""",17,968,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00968
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While I agree with the need to roll out GST on low-value goods and imported non-digital services, the target implementation from 1 January 2023, coupled with the ""sooner rather than later"" hike in GST rates, could mean a double whammy for consumers.",18,969,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00969
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Yet, Mdm Deputy Speaker, this impending GST hike is weighing on not just consumer confidence but also on businesses, especially the retailers hard-hit by COVID-19-related restrictions. The Singapore Tenants United for Fairness group, for example, in commenting on the latest month-long extension of COVID-19 restrictions, shared that the frontline business community is in deep despair and disrepair, and I quote, ""To make matters worse, over the next 12 months, frontline businesses will be further hit by a likely increase of GST to 9%"".",19,970,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00970
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The other factor that is critical to consider is that of inflation. High inflation would simply mean lower real incomes and, at the moment, the debate globally, which has yet to be settled, is whether or not the current inflationary pressures in the market are seen to be transitory or permanent. What I do know, however, is that MAS is concerned enough about inflation to surprise the market with a tightening of monetary policy in October, that is, last month, given that external and domestic cost pressures are accumulating.",20,971,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00971
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"For Singaporeans already grappling with inflation and higher household expenditures, that additional two percentage points may be too much to bear. Yes, there will be the GST Assurance Package that delays and does not deny the impact of higher GST rates. Yes, I acknowledge that there will be an enhancement to the permanent GST Voucher scheme, which, at the moment, only applies to those earning less than $2,300 a month, amongst other conditions. These may be progressive elements involved but does the raising of GST make our tax system as a whole more progressive or more regressive? I believe the answer is clear. Do we really want higher GST to be the straw that breaks the camel's back?",21,972,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00972
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"As I shared in my speech last year, we need to explore other forms of revenue sources before looking to an eventual GST hike to raise tax revenues. The Significant Infrastructure Government Loan (SINGA) Bill was passed earlier this year. We are now casting our GST net further overseas. We are raising carbon tax rates. We are considering wealth taxes. We are in the midst of the OECD global tax reforms which could, as Finance Minister Lawrence Wong pointed out, give Singapore some additional revenue. And as I have shared during the Budget debates earlier this year, not all Government revenues are included in the official Budget.",22,973,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00973
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, while I support this GST amendment Bill, I cannot support a GST hike which will be an unnecessary burden on our fellow Singaporeans, especially at this point in time when inflation is a serious concern and a full recovery of the employment market remains uncertain.",23,974,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00974
2021-11-02-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"We must have the courage to make the difficult decisions that are necessary to uphold a culture of fiscal responsibility, even if it means walking back on a prior decision made under very different circumstances. It is not too late to change course and I strongly urge the Government to reconsider the necessity of a GST hike.",24,975,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00975
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Online sales in Singapore will hit an estimated US$8 billion this year. In a recent report by Bain & Company, e-commerce sales in Singapore are expected to grow to US$10 billion by the end of 2026. In the past 20 months, due to the confluence of factors, such as travel restrictions due to the pandemic, the growth of end mile-delivery platforms, lower-priced alternatives and our digitally well-connected population, online shopping has become the norm for us Singaporeans.",1,976,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00976
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Since the onset of COVID-19, people have changed the way they shop and these changes are unlikely to reverse. A recent study in Singapore last year by Visa also found that three in four consumers in Singapore are shopping online more frequently because of the pandemic and one-third of Singaporeans also made an online purchase for the first time. The same survey also found that more than half of the respondents shopped less frequently in physical stores. This is likely due to the fact that we can purchase almost anything online now, from small, low-value items like cutleries, pots and pans, tools, mattresses and household items to expensive luxury items.",2,977,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00977
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While most of us are enjoying the convenience of online shopping, a portion of our fellow Singaporeans, our small retail merchants, are struggling. In my recent discussion with our Merchants Association in Pasir Ris, our merchants, especially those that sell low-value household items, such as hardware, tools, curtains, small pieces of furniture and non-perishable products, shared that since the pandemic, their business has gone down by up to 40% to 50%.",3,978,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00978
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Ms Ann Tan, a business owner at one of our neighborhood shops in Pasir Ris selling furniture, shared that her business has dropped by 50% and showed examples online where the overseas retailers were charging the same price for the exact same cupboards and shelves without GST. Bike shops also shared examples where small bicycles parts like grips, handlebars and gloves were all available online from overseas but not subjected to GST. The merchants also shared that some customers now are browsing the physical item in the shop, trying out the items, enquiring about the items but when it came to payment, some customers whip out their handphones and ask the shop owners for a lower price compared to what is available online.",4,979,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00979
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The sale of these items used to be the bread-and-butter of our small retail merchants, but it is no longer. With people shopping less frequently in physical stores and the unfair advantage that overseas suppliers have by not paying GST, our neighbourhood businesses are struggling to make ends meet. Hence, our small retail merchants are hoping for a level playing field and the introduction of GST on low-value goods from overseas will be one of the enablers for that.",5,980,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00980
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In addition to the introduction of GST on low-value goods from overseas, these small enterprises will need more assistance to remain competitive with the overseas online retailers. I am glad that we have programmes like IMDA's SMEs Go Digital which has a three-step checklist to go digital and the retail industry digital plan which provides a step-by-step guide on the digital solutions for local retail SMEs. These programmes assist our small retail merchants to start their digital initiatives. However, most of them, at least for the small retailers in Pasir Ris, have found it hard to sustain the digital activities as they are usually a one- or two-man operation and have no resources nor skillsets to continue with these activities.",6,981,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00981
2021-11-02-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Since the intent of introducing GST to low-value items from overseas is to level the playing field, can the Ministry consider the tax income from the activity to be used to provide more support for our neighbourhood retailers, such as hiring more consultants or trainers, to guide more retailers through their digital transformation and provide a support package for the small retailers to continue to sustain their digital activities? Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.",7,982,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00982

While many of us enjoy the convenience of online shopping, other Singaporeans, such as neighbourhood shop owners, clothes sellers and small businesses, are facing challenges in running their business. Many of them have reported their business declining by 40% to 50% and one of the reasons was that prices of low-value items from overseas retailers are not subject to GST.",8,983,2021-11-02-T-014-S-00983

Jia Jia never planned to become a home baker. Out of her passion for baking, she started baking in her parents’ home and archived her creations on Instagram. This attracted significant interest from friends and family, who enquired whether they could commission her to bake cakes for their parties and also make dessert boxes. Her consumer base grew gradually through word of mouth because of the popularity of her bakes and this allowed her to quit her full-time job to focus her attention on her passion-turned-livelihood in baking. Today, she continues to run her bake sales on her Instagram and she has about 9,000 followers on her page.",8,1000,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01000

2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Due to their lack of recognition in the formal economy, these businesses do not receive subsidies for equipment and, sometimes, have restrictions on who they can even do business with, with or without a licence, leading them to struggle to even compete with some of their larger SME counterparts, much less overseas competitors. They keep their prices affordable not just to drive up profit margins, but because they thrive on strong personal relationships with the very people they serve. Absorb the significant dent on profit margins passed on to them by GST and their businesses are in danger. Pass it to their customers and they would feel that they have done them a disservice.",13,1005,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01005
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Further, although it is desired that those affected by the GST on low-value imported goods would channel demand to the local economy, in the case of home business owners, this may not be so. Once again, it must be reiterated that it has always been passion over prices. Our home business owners take a lot of pride in their work and put their heart and soul into their craft. This is one of the biggest draws of supporting home businesses. You know that your product has passed through the watchful eye of a personally invested business owner.",14,1006,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01006
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"And this is why the home business owners I have spoken to maintain that they would never compromise on quality. Sometimes, this commitment to quality requires imports, such as for quality ingredients or materials that simply cannot be found in Singapore. This commitment to quality could pinch their profit margins should they continue to import their ingredients.",15,1007,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01007
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Therefore, Mdm Deputy Speaker, when debating on the tax on importing low-value goods, the question is not whether or not we should be #supportlocal. The question is whether, by doing this, we are really supporting local. In our bid to level the playing field, have we inadvertently made the hill a little bit steeper for some businesses we had intended to support? Would we be able to then further level the playing field through other support mechanisms for our home-based businesses, financial or otherwise, because our home-based businesses are often left unnoticed?",16,1008,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01008
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Further, when debating the imposition of GST on imported goods, we must inspect the substantive benefits accrued to those we seek to uplift. At the peak of the restrictions last year, many Singaporeans were really quite dismayed to see the haunting photos of an empty Orchard Road and the impact on retailers in Singapore since then cannot be understated.",17,1009,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01009
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"With the rise of online shopping and e-commerce, some predict that online competition could spell the gradual debilitation of retail in Singapore. And this is a ghastly prediction the imposition of GST on low-value goods seeks to reverse.",18,1010,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01010
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While this is all done with good intentions, I believe we should not merely aim to prop up the retail sector in Singapore, but usher a new golden resurgence. Just as Times Square, Ginza, Tsim Sha Tsui, Dongdaemun crown the vibrancy of their world-class cities, it is time that Singapore polishes our crown and restores the vibrancy of our retail sector. Merely levelling the playing field with price adjustments will serve us short term, but we cannot settle for stop-gap measures for what has once been the crowning jewel of urban life in Singapore, which is our retail sector.",19,1011,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01011
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I propose that these measures pertaining to price must be complemented with a wider ecosystem change that not only merely props up retail businesses but elevates the retail experience in Singapore. This brings me to the case of Pazzion, best known as a brand for female footwear in Singapore.",20,1012,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01012
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Pazzion opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Marina Square in 2005 and boasts its 10th local outlet as of 2019, in the meantime building its presence in Asia Pacific. What is interesting about Pazzion, however, is that, in recent years, it has broken out of its mould as a fashion business and opened a café over at Jewel, committing to becoming a lifestyle brand that sells experiences beyond goods. Any shop, online or brick-and-mortar, can peddle goods, but I would say brick-and-mortar shops are, at the moment, much better placed to deliver an experience.",21,1013,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01013
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"It is my hope that retailers and mall owners in Singapore can partner up to deliver retail experiences beyond the delivery of retail goods, rejuvenating the retail experiences for Singapore and her visitors. This is how we will truly be able to make the case for retail in Singapore to return to its crowning glory. Online shopping makes purchases possible, but, here in Singapore, passion is made possible.",22,1014,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01014
2021-11-02-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"With this, I call for the distinction to be made for microbusinesses, especially our home-based businesses, when it comes to GST changes and other provisions for growth support. Further, I call on Government agencies to think bigger in revitalising Singaporean retail, going beyond propping up businesses in the short term, to architect a real retail environment for the ages. These concerns notwithstanding, I support the Bill.",23,1015,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01015

2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, this Bill will update our GST regime. Significantly, this Bill will extend GST to imported low-value goods.

Additionally, the Bill will also update the GST treatment for media sales to more closely reflect the reality of how services are advertised and consumed.",1,1017,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01017
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank MOF for consistently consulting the public on its Bills, including this Bill.

2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have two points of clarification to make on this Bill.,3,1019,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01019
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is on the GST treatment for the supply of media sales. The amendments to section 21 mean that the GST treatment for supplies of media sales depends on where the customer and the direct beneficiary of the service belongs, rather than where the advertisement is circulated.",4,1020,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01020
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"IRAS’ e-Tax Guide has provided some guidance on how to identify the “direct beneficiary” of media sales. In particular, the e-Tax Guide provides that the contractual client will, generally, be regarded as the sole direct beneficiary where two conditions are satisfied.",5,1021,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01021
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, the service agreement does not require the services to be provided to another person. Second, the supplier liaises only with the contractual client and is accountable only to the contractual client.",6,1022,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01022
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify if both conditions must be satisfied in order for the contractual client to be deemed the sole direct beneficiary? Or is it sufficient that either one of the conditions is satisfied?,7,1023,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01023
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The e-Tax Guide also provides that when the two conditions are satisfied, the supplier does not need to look beyond the contractual client in determining the correct GST treatment. In the event that the two conditions are not satisfied, can the Minister share what other factors a supplier should take into account to determine who the “direct beneficiary” of the service is?",8,1024,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01024
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In particular, where multiple layers of contracts exist between a service provider and the beneficiary of a service, where should a supplier draw the line in determining its “direct beneficiary”?",9,1025,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01025
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is on the use of best available information to determine whether goods are distantly taxable. The new section 14(1B) provides that a recipient may rely on the best available information to determine whether goods are distantly taxable if the recipient is unable to verify the location of the goods at the point of sale of the goods or how the goods will be transported to a place in the customs territory.,10,1026,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01026
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the public consultation conducted on the Bill, MOF had declined to accept a suggestion that the Bill prescribe information that businesses should rely on to determine if a supply of goods are distantly taxable goods that fall within the scope of GST. MOF declined to prescribe the information to reduce compliance burden and has stated that IRAS will provide examples in its e-Tax Guide.",11,1027,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01027
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While the examples will be useful, what will also be important in the event of a dispute is which party bears the burden of proof. Can the Minister elaborate where the burden of proof lies and how the burden shifts in determining whether there was compliance with the tax treatment of distantly taxable goods? For instance, does the burden of proof shift to the Comptroller of Income Tax once the recipient is able to show a preliminary case that they relied on the best available information? Is the burden of proof then on the Comptroller to show that the recipient, in fact, had access to and should have relied on other information?",12,1028,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01028
2021-11-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This clarification is important because the term “best available information” is so general that it might pose enforcement issues. Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",13,1029,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01029
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, cross-border spending constitutes a key component of our e-commerce market. This is projected to reach $8 billion in 2025. As such, it is important to ensure that our tax policies are reviewed and revised accordingly. The decision to impose taxes on all imports by air or post will help to level the playing field for our local retailers. It will also help to supplement the increased Government spending in the upcoming years. I would like to share my thoughts on four issues.",1,1030,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01030
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we need to provide more support for lower-income households. I am concerned that imposing GST on all incoming overseas goods will lead to an increased burden on these residents. Has the Government done research or sought feedback on how foreign online retailers intend to handle this tax increase? Will it be absorbed? If not, how much of it will be passed on to the consumers? As this new Bill mainly impacts individual buyers, the additional tax will be a heavier burden for our lower- to middle-income families. This will be compounded by the impact of the GST hike that is likely to be implemented in the next few years.",2,1031,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01031
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Are there further measures on top of the existing Assurance Package and GST vouchers to mitigate the impact on them? Or can the quantum of these initiatives be increased to help families, given this new change? Will it be possible to utilise the Assurance Package or GST vouchers to cover online purchases, too?",3,1032,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01032
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we need to continue to encourage our local retailers to compete globally. Compared to many of their overseas competitors, which have large economies of scale, SMEs are disadvantaged, as they often have to pay high rental and labour costs. If the savings on purchasing foreign imports are reduced, this could diminish the attraction of overseas purchases, thereby encouraging more Singaporeans to support local businesses.",4,1033,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01033
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Nevertheless, why do Singaporeans shop from overseas sites? According to a survey, eight in 10 local respondents shared that the main reason was the overall lower cost of procuring goods and services from foreign sites. The second reason was the wider variety of international brands’ products and the lack of availability from local retailers. If Singaporeans cannot find their preferred brand, services or shopping experience locally, the imposition of the GST will do little to shift their buying behaviour towards local businesses.",5,1034,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01034
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As such, local businesses must not be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking that they can rest on their laurels and become complacent with the perceived decreased competition from foreign markets. They must continue to innovate, use business analytics to understand their customers’ needs, establish global partnerships and bring in products that are in high demand. The Government must continue to encourage and support our local businesses to compete globally by embarking on digitalisation and by getting onto these online retail platforms. In this connection, perhaps the additional tax revenue from the imposition of GST can be funnelled to support the globalisation efforts of local businesses.",6,1035,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01035
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my third point is on the need to tackle implementation challenges that come with the new taxation policies. With more companies and individuals obliged to comply with the new GST regime, compliance costs will, therefore, increase. What is the estimated number of low-value transactions in a year?",7,1036,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01036
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"There may be a disproportionately large number of low- versus high-value transactions. As such, the Government may require disproportionately more resources to ensure that individuals comply with the new GST regulations. How will the Government ensure that there are adequate resources to enforce the new policies in an efficient manner? Will more personnel be hired to handle the additional workload at IRAS? In light of the additional cost to ensure compliance, has any study been done to weigh up the cost of compliance, including prosecution of GST evasion, and the potential tax revenue that may be generated?",8,1037,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01037
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"With the new law, individuals are subjected to taxation or reverse charge. Is IRAS ready for the potential increase in enforcement action when this comes into play? As for businesses, local GST is imposed on all GST-registered companies in Singapore. They collect GST from the customers or absorb it. And the collective amount is paid to the Government. Will foreign retailers who wish to sell to the Singapore market be GST-registered? How will the Government engage these foreign businesses and provide them with the relevant legislative and administrative material, so that they have sufficient time to understand and apply the new practices?",9,1038,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01038
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Perhaps this ties in with my above point on compliance. There are foreign companies with a large online shopping presence in Singapore, such as Amazon, Taobao and Lazada. These companies allow smaller third-party companies to sell on their platform. Have the relevant stakeholders engaged these companies to collaboratively resolve the issue of compliance?",10,1039,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01039
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"What if the foreign retailer withholds GST payment? How will the Government deal with overseas companies who fail to comply with our GST regulations? In the case of New Zealand, their Inland Revenue would monitor for non-complying retailers. Under international agreements, it can request counterparts in some countries to collect tax on its behalf or assess and pursue unpaid tax through a retailer’s national courts. Is this an option that we would pursue? Or will the burden then irrevocably fall on the customer as a reverse charge?",11,1040,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01040
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In addition, similar to Member Saktiandi Supaat's earlier point, how will consumers be made aware about whether their payment at the point of purchase already includes GST? And will they be told that they have to pay additional GST to collect their parcel in Singapore? SingPost has recently switched to an online cashless system for collecting GST on packages valued above $400. The new policy would see a significant rise in the number of packages due for GST payment. This could also provide opportunities for scams. Unscrupulous merchants may leverage on this to cheat consumers into paying them a sum to retrieve their purchase. Parcel clearance scams, where callers masquerade as customs officers asking for payment to retrieve a parcel, have not been uncommon even before this. It is thus imperative to educate consumers on when and where GST is to be paid and the official payment platforms to do so. I would expect that SingPost or other online delivery platforms would be well-equipped by then to address more queries concerning GST payments on their parcels.",12,1041,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01041
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"How will the Government keep track of all parcels coming into Singapore and their GST payment status? Some packages may contain purchases from small businesses, or gifts from family and friends. Some may not come with invoices.",13,1042,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01042
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second-hand items like those from eBay, may have had their GST paid when the items were first bought. Are these second-hand items still subjected to GST taxation a second time? It is also not unheard of that some foreign retailers would allow customers to under-declare the value of their purchases to evade taxes, or to reduce the amount of tax payment due. How will the Government police these?",14,1043,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01043
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my last point is on the implementation for media sales. Many firms now employ gig workers from overseas or outsource to provide remote services like designing programmes or media pieces.",15,1044,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01044
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Such services are difficult to apply a quantum to and are easy to evade. As such, many of these services could be under-declared or not declared at all, to avoid GST. In addition, many of these small firms may neither have a turnover of $1 million nor are GST-registered. Will these firms – which may be acting as an underlying supplier or re-deliverer – be liable for reverse charge, if the services provided are below $400? If reverse charge still applies to these firms, can they still pass these additional costs to the consumers?",16,1045,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01045
2021-11-02-T-016,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, taxing all imports is necessary as e-commerce grows globally.

Her husband, who is the sole breadwinner, is a delivery driver and does not earn a lot. Mdm K supplements her family income by importing children’s story books, toiletries and cosmetics from China and Korea, which are either cheaper or not available in Singapore. These items do not cost a lot. And Mdm K brings in items in small amounts. I, therefore, urge the Government to provide some support to the lower-income groups, micro businesses and entrepreneurs like Mdm K and her family who may be significantly affected by the changes, if the tax is passed to them.",18,1047,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01047

For example, if the media sales supplier's contract is with an overseas headquarters, but the contract requires the media sales to be, first, provided to a subsidiary in Singapore, or second, the media sales supplier is accountable to the subsidiary in Singapore for his service deliverables, then the subsidiary in Singapore is the direct beneficiary of the service.",27,1093,2021-11-02-T-016-S-01093

2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"On that note, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I just have one ask from this Adjournment Motion  that the Government significantly increase the stock of rental flats across flat sizes, thereby creating a viable and expanded public rental scheme, with an emphasis on ensuring that our lower- to middle-income households’ housing needs are well looked after.",4,1130,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01130
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Let us first take stock of the existing housing model in Singapore today, particularly as it relates to rental housing. When HDB first started building flats, it built rental flats. From 1960 to 1965, there were 42,408 rental flats versus only 2,967 home ownership flats, given the Government’s home ownership scheme really only started in 1964.",5,1131,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01131
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"After decades of pushing for home ownership, when HDB resumed the rental building programme in 2007, only 1-room and 2-room flats were built. As at the HDB’s latest annual report, there were about 63,773 rental flats as of March 2021, compared to 1.02 million sold flats, out of which a dominant 97% of the flats are 1-room and 2-room flats.",6,1132,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01132
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"HDB rentals today take on three different forms, the Public Rental Scheme (PRS), Interim Rental Housing (IRH) and Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS).

2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Flats under the PRS in its current form are supposed to be heavily subsidised to cater to Singaporean households who, in the HDB’s words, have no other housing options. Another eligibility criterion is the low total household gross income threshold of not exceeding $1,500 per month, with monthly rents for a 1-room flat ranging from $26 a month to $205 a month and a 2-room flat from $44 a month to $275 a month.",8,1134,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01134
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Interim Rental Housing is similar to the PRS in that it is for low-income households with no family support and no other housing options, where the HDB will consider offering IRH on a case-by-case basis.",9,1135,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01135
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Lastly, the PPHS was part of the enhanced Marriage and Parenthood Package and helps to temporarily house families as they await the completion of their new flats. Rents are between $400 and $500 for 2-room flats, $600 to $900 for 3-room flats, and $1,500 for 4-room flats, depending on their location.",10,1136,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01136
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Fundamentally, I believe that there needs to be a greater diversity of housing options but, more urgently, the key problem, in my view, is that there is a severe shortage of HDB rental flats in its various forms today and supply is simply insufficient to meet current demands.",11,1137,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01137
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"As I have noted earlier, there were 63,773 rental flats as of March this year, the vast majority of which would comprise 1-room and 2-room flats under the PRS. Worryingly, there are only about 1,600 rental flats under construction, which will be completed progressively by around 2025. In response to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) in May earlier this year, Minister Desmond Lee noted, and I quote, that  “There are currently about 31,000 1-room and 31,000 2-room flats. We have sufficient supply for households who need these flats”.",12,1138,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01138
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"However, I understand from another PQ filed by Member Ms Nadia Samdin that the average waiting time for a rental flat has lengthened to about five months. I understand from a fellow Workers' Party Member of Parliament that HDB shared in a reply in late May that HDB is facing an island-wide shortage of 1-room flats and that all four zones are having an estimated waiting time of about six months from date of registration.",13,1139,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01139
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I recognise that part of this is also related to COVID-19-related constraints, such as taking up a longer time to spruce up flats that have been returned to the HDB before they are let out to new tenants. I am sure Members of this House would have received many requests by your residents to assist them with an appeal for a rental flat from the HDB, just as I have. Again, in response to my PQ in April this year, Minister Desmond Lee shared that, from 2016 to 2020, HDB received an average of 7,500 requests regarding rental flats and only about 35% or an average of 2,600 such requests were successful each year.",14,1140,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01140
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"So, while we may say that a wait time of two months pre-COVID-19 is “okay”, the eligibility conditions around public rental flats are highly restrictive. In fact, the total household income cap of $1,500 a month is even lower than the Average Monthly Household Income from Work of the lowest 10% of resident employed households! Just how many truly needy citizen families have we excluded as a result of the tight eligibility conditions?",15,1141,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01141
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"A similar situation can be said for the PPHS. Again, in response to my PQ in May, there were 110 2-room, 570 3-room and 60 4-room flats for the PPHS, or a total of 740 flats. As the Minister noted, the supply of PPHS flats is limited and depends on the availability of vacant flats, such as those in vacated blocks not immediately needed for redevelopment.",16,1142,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01142
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I acknowledge that in HDB’s press release in August, the number of existing PPHS flats is now 840, with another 800 more flats to be set aside over the next two years. It is commendable that HDB is doubling the number of PPHS flats. In absolute numbers, however, we are dealing with a very low base today, given that the demand for such flats has far exceeded the limited supply.",17,1143,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01143
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The HDB also introduced a household income ceiling of $7,000 and switched to conducting PPHS exercises every two months instead of monthly to, and I quote, “provide PPHS applicants with a larger pool of flats to choose from. This will improve the applicants’ chance of securing a flat”. However, the number of flats available still appears to be very limited at 60 in October and with a very high application rate of more than nine times, given 544 applications received, indicating excess latent demand that cannot be met with the existing supply.",18,1144,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01144

2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Firstly, creating a diversity of living options would better support the diverse needs of our fellow Singaporeans, especially millennials who are faced with limited living options. Going for a BTO flat has been the avenue to provide couples an affordable home for their future families. However, even if one beats the odds of securing a BTO flat, application rates of between three and 25 times were seen in the recent August sale exercise. Also, the average waiting time for BTO projects has increased, from an average of three to four years in the past to four to five years for ongoing BTO projects. And as I have shared, the odds of securing a PPHS flat is equally low. Meanwhile, resale HDB prices are now 12.5% higher than what they were a year ago.",20,1146,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01146
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Singaporeans who are more financially well to do have access to open market HDB or private residential rentals or even accessing serviced residences and co-living apartments. The desire by millennials to have a space of their own is well reported, with a Business Times (BT) article dated 18 June highlighting that more Singaporeans are moving out of family homes into formerly expat-dominated co-living properties and serviced residences. On 11 September, Today published a similar article, titled “Affluent and craving space to grow, more single millennials leave the nest for greater freedom”. Should we not cater to the changing housing needs and aspirations of all our millennials today regardless of their income?",21,1147,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01147
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Secondly, adequately satisfying the housing needs of young couples could arguably be supportive of our fertility rate, which has been steadily declining and is now at a record low of 1.1. Undoubtedly, a good number of couples have been affected by construction delays in existing BTO projects; and with low odds of securing a new BTO project, given high application rates, without a place of their own, are left with no choice but to rethink their family planning decisions. We need to recognise that everyone’s circumstances change all the time and we should cater to Singaporeans’ housing needs across life stages, as people may decide it is most appropriate to rent or buy at different stages of their lives.",22,1148,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01148
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Besides, by providing young couples with an alternative to save up larger amounts of capital which would have otherwise been locked up in their housing asset, this might encourage them to start families at a younger age and be open to having more children.",23,1149,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01149
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thirdly, on workforce flexibility. The need for a dynamic and flexible workforce today would mean that individuals may need to take greater calculated risks or seek alternative pathways to advance their careers. What we have not adequately considered is that individuals require the financial freedom to pursue these tough choices. Would you still take up that overseas posting or pursue further graduate studies if you are tied to a significant mortgage or if it means your MOP would have to be extended?",24,1150,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01150

Take Vienna, for example. About half of social housing units are owned directly by the municipal government and the rest by state-subsidised, not-for-profit co-operatives. Private developers who build affordable housing projects must allow the city to rent half of the new apartments to lower-income residents, while the developer leases out the remaining units.

Just as how REITs allow for the fractional ownership of commercial property assets, the stock of HDB rental units can similarly be held in a REIT structure, be it a public or private REIT. This would also have the additional benefit of supporting the financing of the construction of new rental flats and is self-sustaining, reducing the cash costs on the part of the Government.",50,1176,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01176

Singaporeans can enjoy the benefits of renting, while also truly say that they own a HDB flat, or a part of Singapore's entire stock of HDB flats.",51,1177,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01177
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"To conclude, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the idea of an expanded public rental scheme by HDB is not new. The Workers' Party has, in our 2019 HDB Working Paper, proposed the creation of a viable and expanded public rental scheme, which, in our view, is a realistic proposal to expand the universe of options for rental for those Singaporeans who want this option for a certain number of years.",52,1178,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01178
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Let us also remember that the concept of leasing is not new to HDB. The concept of owning a HDB flat is a misnomer where Singaporeans have signed with HDB a lease agreement and not exactly a sale and purchase agreement, albeit one which is for 99 years, lease payments are paid upfront and you are able to take out a loan to pay for it.",53,1179,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01179
2021-11-02-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Further, the concept of having shorter leases is also not new. Today, elderly residents aged 55 and above already have the flexibility of choosing the length of lease on their 2-room flexi flats, ranging from between 15 and 45 years in five-year increments, as long as it covers them and their spouse up to the age of at least 95 years. It really is simply just a difference in mode of payment, where the lease payment is paid upfront, as compared to regular monthly payments in the case of conventional open market short-term leases.",54,1180,2021-11-02-T-018-S-01180

While our overall housing policy continues to support families, we recognise the home ownership aspirations that many singles have. For instance, some singles have had to forgo opportunities of forming families of their own because of caregiver responsibilities. Seniors who are single also tend to be more vulnerable than those who can count on the support of their spouses, children and even grandchildren. In such cases, home ownership can be material in improving a person's well-being as well as financial security.

Anyone who contravenes this law can be fined up to $50,000 and/or jailed for up to two years under the Health Products Act.",2,1240,2021-11-02-T-021-S-01240
2021-11-02-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Defence how does Singapore view the relevance and significance of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) on its 50th anniversary and the recent conclusion of its Exercise Bersama Gold 2021, especially with a UK carrier strike group visiting South China Sea for the first time in many years and in light of the continuing tensions in the South China Sea.",1,1241,2021-11-02-T-022-S-01241
2021-11-02-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) was established in 1971 to provide critical security for Malaysia and Singapore, then two young nations, following the withdrawal of British forces. Fifty years on, while the security context has changed, the remit of the FPDA has remained the same, that is, for member-nations to consult one another in the event of a threat or actual armed aggression against Malaysia or Singapore. This was reaffirmed by all member-nations at the recent FPDA Defence Ministers’ Meeting held in October 2021.",1,1242,2021-11-02-T-022-S-01242
2021-11-02-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The FPDA also continues to bring value to its member-nations through exchanges and exercises that build confidence and enhance cooperation and interoperability across our militaries. In recent years, these activities have incorporated contemporary security threats, such as terrorism. Exercise Bersama Gold this year is the highlight exercise for the FPDA’s 50th Anniversary. The fact that, despite the pandemic, member-nations successfully held an exercise with around 2,700 troops, many ships and planes and a submarine, and pulled together a flypast and naval display over the Marina Bay area in Singapore reflects the strong, continued commitment of the five countries to the FPDA. It also underscores the FPDA’s non-threatening posture. Neighbouring countries understand and accept that the FPDA is not targeted at any one country or grouping, but has, for the past 50 years, been a transparent grouping that contributes to regional peace and security.",2,1243,2021-11-02-T-022-S-01243
2021-11-02-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The FPDA complements other multilateral and bilateral defence exchanges which Singapore engages in. The Member mentioned the UK’s Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group's recent transit through this region. Singapore has longstanding defence ties with the UK – in part, because of history, through the FPDA, but also because of shared interest in upholding international law and a rules-based order. We have welcomed UK ships calling at Singapore for decades for FPDA exercises, as well as for bilateral port calls and replenishment stops. We continue to welcome the UK’s constructive engagement in the region.",3,1244,2021-11-02-T-022-S-01244

2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Government introduced the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) in 2020 to provide rapid, broad-based wage support to help employers retain their local employees during the height of the COVID-19 crisis.",1,1247,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01247
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"JSS payouts are computed based on actual mandatory employer CPF contributions made to bona fide employees. The CPF Act requires employers to make CPF contributions on wages payable to their employees, subject to the prevailing wage ceilings. Employers will not receive JSS payouts if they fail to make CPF contributions for their employees for the respective reference month. Similarly, if employers cut wages for their employees during the respective reference month, their JSS payout will be correspondingly reduced. In other words, the JSS is designed as a reimbursement to help employers offset part of the wages already paid to their employees. Announcing the timing and schedule of JSS payouts allowed employers to take these payouts into account and retain local workers despite the challenging economic circumstances during the pandemic.",2,1248,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01248
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We also capped the Government’s co-funding under the JSS to the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee. This means that employees and senior executives whose gross monthly wages are higher than $4,600 will have a lower effective JSS support.",3,1249,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01249
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Given how JSS payouts are computed, MOF does not track the data that Mr Zhulkarnain asked about. To prevent abuse of JSS, IRAS, as the administrator of JSS, has instituted a robust anti-gaming framework since the first JSS payout in April 2020. For cases with high risk of fraud, such as irregular CPF contributions to get higher JSS payouts, IRAS requires the firms to authenticate their CPF contributions before the payouts are released. As of August 2021, 1,889 cases have been denied or had their JSS payout adjusted. Cases with strong corroborative evidence to support JSS abuse are reported to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) for further investigation and prosecution. As of August 2021, 10 cases are undergoing Police investigations.",4,1250,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01250
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides IRAS’ anti-gaming checks for JSS, the CPF Board also audits employers to check the accuracy of CPF contributions paid and wages declared. The CPF Board is also piloting the CPF Contribution Alert which allows employees to receive personalised notifications when their monthly CPF contributions are credited. Employees can conveniently verify the wages declared by their employers and CPF contributions paid by their employers against their payslip. Employees and whistle blowers can lodge reports to the CPF Board for any non-compliance of CPF contributions.",5,1251,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01251
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The JSS and other COVID-19 economic relief grants were meant to support businesses in this period of significant economic uncertainty. While the Government does not intervene in how business owners and board directors determine remuneration and bonuses for key executives, they are expected to practise good corporate governance and stewardship. In particular, a good practice is to exclude Government grants in the computation of a company’s financial performance for the purposes of determining remuneration and bonuses for key executives. This is because Government grants are not a result of the performance efforts of these key executives. We understand that the Singapore Institute of Directors will also be putting up some guidelines on best practices in remuneration governance soon.",6,1252,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01252
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For companies that are managing well, we encourage them to return the JSS to us, or donate the JSS received to a charity of their choice. It is commendable that companies which were able to cope well with the crisis have declined to receive JSS or donated the JSS received. Some have asked to remain anonymous for internal organisational reasons. Meanwhile, there are also companies that have chosen to use the JSS in other responsible ways, such as providing additional training to upskill their employees or expanding their operations, hiring more Singaporeans as a result.",7,1253,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01253
2021-11-02-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will need to study carefully the implications of publishing the list of organisations that have returned part or all of their JSS, balancing public recognition, requests for anonymity and the risks of placing undue pressure on other firms that have been using the JSS monies responsibly in other ways.",8,1254,2021-11-02-T-023-S-01254

This includes regular tracking of the project progress on site, to ensure early detection of issues to ensure timely and appropriate actions can be taken to bring the project back on track. Contractors are also assessed every six months under HDB’s Contractors Performance Assessment (CPA) framework, which takes into account the progress of site works, the quality of works completed, as well as site safety. Poor performance in any of these indicators during construction will result in lower CPA scores and impact the contractor’s ability to secure future HDB projects.",1,1286,2021-11-02-T-029-S-01286

We have also finetuned the eligibility conditions and allocation process to prioritise families in greater need of subsidised temporary housing. As the supply of PPHS flats will remain limited, we encourage flat buyers waiting for the completion of their BTO flats to continue living with their families or consider renting from the open market.

On average, the mortgage servicing ratio, which is the proportion of monthly income used to service mortgage instalment payments, has remained stable at 23% among resale flat buyers taking an HDB housing loan, over the past three years. This means that first-timer buyers, generally, have little or no cash outlay in servicing the payments for their resale flats as their mortgage loans can be paid using their CPF contributions.

This is a 24-hour duty, which is a longstanding practice that all doctors have gone through to ensure a seamless continuity of care for the patients. To support the well-being of doctors, guidelines on the frequency and duration of night-calls have been introduced. For example, for Post Graduate Year 1 doctors, after a 24-hour duty, they should spend no more than six additional hours for handing over and other activities. Surveys showed that 85% complied with this requirement. Number of calls are mostly within SMC guidelines of four to seven per month.",4,1326,2021-11-02-T-037-S-01326

2021-11-02-T-038,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"With these efforts and assistance measures, we have been able to minimise the extent of further delays to BTO projects. Thus far, the average waiting time for ongoing BTO projects, including delays brought about by the pandemic, has remained between four and five years.

2021-11-02-T-038,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To improve construction productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour, BCA has been working with the industry to adopt the Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) building method on a wider scale. DfMA allows building components to be fabricated off-site in automated facilities and subsequently assembled on-site. This reduces our on-site workforce, raises productivity, improves workmanship and reduces disamenities to residents near construction sites.",4,1334,2021-11-02-T-038-S-01334

We aim to make DfMA the default building method, especially for large projects, as they have more economies of scale for off-site fabrication. To do so, BCA will enhance its Buildability Framework by raising the minimum Buildable Design Score (B-Score) for large commercial, institutional and industrial developments with Gross Floor Area (GFA) of at least 25,000 sqm. Firms can tap on the Productivity Innovation Project (PIP) scheme under the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF) to help support the upfront cost of adopting DfMA solutions.",5,1335,2021-11-02-T-038-S-01335

2021-11-02-T-040,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the issue of parking which the Member has raised, Government and Statutory Boards, including schools, are required to implement market-rate parking charges. This arose from previous AGO audit observations. Given the long-term nature of season parking, season parking rates are not waived or refunded due to partial use. This applies to all Government-managed car parks, even if the season parking holder does not physically come into the office on certain days due to work from home or hybrid work arrangements. Hence, the parking rates are worked out on the basis of a flat monthly charge, with no pro-rating or waiver for days when there are days of non-usage. This also means that the monthly season rates typically translate to a fairly reasonable pricing, which is certainly the case for school season parking, as compared to alternative time-based parking options at nearby public carparks.",3,1344,2021-11-02-T-040-S-01344

2021-11-02-T-041,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB flats are meant for long-term owner occupation. The minimum occupation period, or MOP, for new and resale HDB flats ensures that flat buyers purchase HDB flats with the intent of living in the flat, instead of quickly reselling the flats for profit. This safeguards HDB flats for households with genuine housing needs and deters speculative purchases, thereby helping to keep HDB flats affordable.",1,1346,2021-11-02-T-041-S-01346
2021-11-02-T-041,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While reducing the MOP may temporarily increase the number of flats available on the resale market, it is unlikely to significantly increase the overall housing supply as flat sellers will need alternative housing and will add to the demand for resale flats. It would also compromise the intent of the MOP and could encourage short-term, speculative churning of HDB flats. This would then result in buyers paying higher prices for resale flats.",2,1347,2021-11-02-T-041-S-01347

2021-11-02-T-045,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the probability of contracting COVID-19 from close contacts with COVID-19-positive family members on the Home Recovery Programme; and (b) how does this contrast with those who become infected at their workplace.,1,1362,2021-11-02-T-045-S-01362
2021-11-02-T-045,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,I thank the Members for their questions. I have addressed them in my reply to Question Nos 77 to 85 for oral answer on the Order Paper for 1 November 2021. [,1,1363,2021-11-02-T-045-S-01363
2021-11-02-T-046,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider increasing the deterring measures for those who have taken part, in full or in part, in the perpetration of scams or scam syndicates via telecommunication media to victimise the public.",1,1364,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01364
2021-11-02-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Depending on the facts of the case, persons who take part in the perpetration of scams can be charged with one of the cheating-related offences under sections 417 to 420A of the Penal Code, which carry imprisonment terms of up to between three and 10 years. MHA’s assessment is that these penalties are adequate for now.",1,1365,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01365
2021-11-02-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The main challenge in combating scams perpetrated via telecommunication media is that most of the scammers are based overseas. We have adopted a multi-pronged approach to tackle them. This is led by the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS).,2,1366,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01366
2021-11-02-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, we have strengthened enforcement. We have been actively collaborating with foreign law enforcement agencies to share information that may lead to the arrest of scammers based abroad. For example, between June and September 2021, the Singapore Police Force worked with the Royal Malaysian Police, Hong Kong Police Force and Taiwan Police, to bust 10 transnational syndicates involved in job scams, Internet love scams and impersonation scams.",3,1367,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01367
2021-11-02-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, we are partnering stakeholders outside of the Home Team to combat scams upstream. One such initiative is ScamShield, an iOS mobile app developed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and GovTech, launched in November 2020. Apart from blocking SMS messages and calls from known scam numbers, ScamShield also has a function for users to report suspected scam calls and messages to the Police. As of 30 September 2021, there have been more than 210,000 user downloads, 1.8 million scam SMSes blocked, and 11,900 suspected scam phone numbers blocked. The ScamShield team is presently working on an Android version of the app which is expected to be released by end of this year.",4,1368,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01368
2021-11-02-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In addition, IMDA has required the telecom operators to block international calls that spoof numbers, for example, 999, 995 and other numbers of our Government agencies. IMDA has also implemented the ""+"" prefix for all international calls since April 2020 to help consumers who are not expecting any overseas calls to be more vigilant and exercise greater care when answering such calls.",5,1369,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01369
2021-11-02-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, we are strengthening public education and awareness. The best defence against scams is a discerning public. For example, we have been working with partners, such as the NCPC, to disseminate advisories to the public through various media and online platforms. We urge members of public to stay vigilant and also to watch out for their families and friends to prevent them from falling prey to scams.",6,1370,2021-11-02-T-046-S-01370

2021-11-02-T-049,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As of 30 September 2021, 90% of the rough sleepers and homeless accepted into MSF’s temporary shelters have been fully vaccinated. We are unable to monitor the vaccination rate of those still sleeping rough on the streets. MSF is collaborating closely with partners to conduct physical outreach (in alignment with allowed group sizes) to continue to encourage these individuals to be fully vaccinated and get their booster shots when eligible. The rough sleepers can also walk into our mRNA vaccination centres without appointment to receive their primary doses since 10 August 2021.",1,1376,2021-11-02-T-049-S-01376

2021-11-02-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks adopts a holistic and science-based approach to managing the pigeon population in Singapore, comprising measures, such as food source reduction, habitat modification and population control.",1,1378,2021-11-02-T-050-S-01378
2021-11-02-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Food made available by humans is a key driver of pest bird population growth. To reduce the availability of food sources, NParks works closely with SFA, NEA and Town Councils to encourage proper food waste management at food establishments and to enforce against littering and illegal bird-feeding. As part of its education and outreach efforts, NParks also partners Town Councils, MSO, PA and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to engage feeders. This enables NParks to find out feeders’ motivations and discourage them from continuing to feed birds.",2,1379,2021-11-02-T-050-S-01379
2021-11-02-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks also works closely with stakeholders to ensure that its population control methods for pigeons are conducted in a sustainable and humane manner. For example, NParks works with Town Councils and the industry to equip workers with the necessary skills and methods to handle and remove pigeons properly during their operations and to maintain general cleanliness afterwards.",3,1380,2021-11-02-T-050-S-01380
2021-11-02-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,NParks will continue to work with agencies and regularly review its measures to manage the pigeon population to safeguard public safety and health. All of us can also play our part by not feeding these pest birds and keeping our environment clean.,4,1381,2021-11-02-T-050-S-01381
2021-11-02-T-051,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the  Minister for Social and Family Development,1,1382,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01382
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past five years, there has been an increase in the number of civil divorce cases where shared care and control was awarded, from 161 cases in 2016 to 256 cases in 2020. This translates to an increase in the proportion of civil divorces with shared care and control orders made, from 5.6% in 2016 to 9.5% in 2020.",1,1383,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01383
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Regarding studies on shared care and control, an overseas scan of Western jurisdictions that have considered or legislated shared care and control, also referred to as ""shared parenting time"", found that there is no consensus on whether such an arrangement benefits the child. For example, in 2018, a study by Elizabeth Keogh, Bruce Smythe and Alexander Masardo found that in Australia, which legislated default ""shared parenting time"" since 2006, shared-time arrangements may work well for children where separated parents are able to cooperate and communicate in ways that avoid or contain conflict. This increases the longevity and quality of the relationship between the child and both parents, encouraging parents to maintain or establish a meaningful relationship in all aspects of the child’s life1.",2,1384,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01384
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, the same study found there are also risks arising from shared-time arrangements, especially where (i) there are high levels of entrenched interparental conflict; (ii) where a parent has safety concerns; or (iii) where the child is an infant or very young. Where there are high levels of ongoing conflict, shared-time arrangements may be more damaging because children are likely to be “caught and used” in conflicts. Where there are safety concerns arising from issues, such as family violence, mental health, alcohol or substance abuse, child well-being could also be negatively affected in a shared-time arrangement.",3,1385,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01385
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Lastly, the appropriateness of shared-time arrangements for infants and young children remains highly contested2. An earlier study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies in 2009 showed that children in shared-time arrangements fared slightly better than those who were mainly in the care of one parent and spent some time with the non-resident parent on some measures, but the differences were small and largely disappeared after controlling for demographics and other characteristics3.",4,1386,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01386
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In terms of local studies, MSF’s 2020 Study on Co-Parenting Styles (""Co-Parenting Study"") found that the cooperative co-parenting style is associated with positive child outcomes, such as less child behavioural and emotional problems and better school learning behaviour, compared to parallel co-parenting and single parenting. Cooperative co-parenting is characterised by parents who communicate frequently and collaborate with each other regarding their children’s matters and make major decisions about their children together. Parallel co-parenting is characterised by parents who tend not to communicate with each other and seldom make major decisions about their children together, but both continue to be involved in their children’s lives.",5,1387,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01387
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Lastly, single parenting is characterised by parents who do not communicate with each other and only one parent is heavily involved in their children’s lives.",6,1388,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01388
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our finding corroborates those from overseas which show that children who experienced cooperative co-parenting exhibit fewer behavioural problems. The cooperative co-parenting style was, however, independent of whether there was sole or shared care and control.",7,1389,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01389
2021-11-02-T-051,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Hence, there are no conclusive findings on the benefits of shared care and control both locally and overseas. Instead, research shows that cooperative co-parenting is associated with better outcomes for children and MSF will continue to support and encourage divorced parents to practise cooperative co-parenting to serve the best interests of their children.",8,1390,2021-11-02-T-051-S-01390
2021-11-02-T-052,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether it will be publishing on REACH’s platforms any public consultation exercise specifically on revisions to the carbon tax and whether sufficient time will be given to the public to incorporate suggestions before Budget 2022; (b) whether any revision to the carbon tax will also include revisions to the carbon tax target by 2030; and (c) whether a summary of the resulting feedback and responses to the exercise will be provided to the public before Budget 2022.,1,1391,2021-11-02-T-052-S-01391
2021-11-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As the Minister for Finance has indicated at Budget 2021, the Government is currently reviewing our carbon tax and will announce at Budget 2022 the revised post-2023 carbon tax level and indicate what we can expect up to 2030.",1,1392,2021-11-02-T-052-S-01392
2021-11-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Public consultation on the carbon tax has been ongoing as part of engagements under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which include conversations on the need for a revised carbon tax and the trade-offs involved in our transition to a greener and more sustainable future. NCCS, MTI and agencies will also leverage other platforms, which may include REACH, to engage the public in the lead up to Budget 2022. The Government will also engage businesses on the potential impact of a higher carbon tax and how we can support them in pursuing green growth opportunities.",2,1393,2021-11-02-T-052-S-01393
2021-11-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Feedback received from the consultations will be taken into consideration in the review. The Government will provide a summary of relevant feedback at the appropriate time.,3,1394,2021-11-02-T-052-S-01394

2021-11-02-T-053,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Formal requests for a doctor’s memo or medical test result through hospital administration cost $8 on average.

2021-11-02-T-053,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Medical reports containing more details of the patient’s medical condition, such as reports required for insurance underwriting, could range from about $90 to $535, depending on the complexity of the medical report.",2,1397,2021-11-02-T-053-S-01397
2021-11-02-T-053,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Restructured hospitals charge for these reports on a cost recovery basis for manpower and other administrative costs incurred. For more complex reports, a doctor may need to review the patient’s medical records in order to produce the report. Charges are, therefore, levied for the service of generating these reports.",3,1398,2021-11-02-T-053-S-01398
2021-11-02-T-053,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Patients with financial difficulty can request for these charges to be waived. Other reasons, such as whether the report is an official requirement, may be submitted to the hospital, for consideration for fee waivers.",4,1399,2021-11-02-T-053-S-01399

2021-11-02-T-054,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For an offence to be considered a serious offence listed in the Schedule of the Organised Crime Act (OCA), the offence must pose a serious threat to public safety and security in Singapore. The offence must also be one that is associated with organised crime in Singapore. Examples of crimes in the Schedule to the OCA include murder, drug-trafficking and unlicensed moneylending.",1,1401,2021-11-02-T-054-S-01401
2021-11-02-T-054,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The offences under sections 4 and 5 of the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (ESA) and sections 8 and 9 of the Wildlife Act relate to the international and domestic trade of wildlife without the requisite permits, and the offence under section 19 of the ESA is for the abetment of offences under the ESA. We take these offences seriously. However, the question is whether they will qualify under the OCA – do they pose a serious threat to public safety and security in Singapore and are they related to organised crime? Over the years, NParks has investigated and made a number of prosecutions for illegal wildlife trade. These cases have so far not been found to be associated with organised crime in Singapore. That said, MHA and MND will monitor the developments. We do not rule out including these offences under OCA if the specific criteria set out are met. We will emphasise  even if they are not within the ambit of the OCA, nevertheless, they are considered serious offences.",2,1402,2021-11-02-T-054-S-01402

Banks, generally, act only upon the instructions of the account holder unless he has provided written consent and mandated another person to operate the account on his behalf.

We can share with them information and other resources on scam prevention. The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) has a dedicated website – scamsalert.sg – which provides useful tips on how to identify and avoid falling prey to scams, as well as a mobile application – ScamShield – which will block scam calls based on a list of numbers maintained by the Police. We can also discuss with family members the banking facilities they require for daily use and advise them to protect their accounts by setting appropriate transaction limits and lowering transaction alert thresholds. These are basic measures that can help them stay alert to unauthorised transfers and limit their financial losses in the event of an unauthorised transaction.",4,1430,2021-11-02-T-059-S-01430

2021-11-02-T-063,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Helium is used to cool semiconductor components and the superconducting magnet in magnetic resonant imaging machines due to its high thermal conductivity. Helium is also used in some healthcare settings, such as to inflate intra-aortic balloon pumps. Firms have a natural incentive to not waste helium to minimise costs.",2,1443,2021-11-02-T-063-S-01443

2021-11-02-T-064,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The ability to use NRIC or other identification documents at selected Community Clubs/Centres and Residents’ Committee Centres in Singapore has made it easier for some groups, such as seniors, to redeem their vouchers. Alongside other efforts to enhance the redemption process, such as setting up SRV counters at attractions, more citizens have been able to redeem their vouchers and enjoy the tourism offerings in Singapore.",2,1446,2021-11-02-T-064-S-01446
2021-11-02-T-064,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The SRV was designed to give Singaporeans an opportunity to rediscover the charms of Singapore and to support the core tourism sectors, such as hotels, attractions and tours.

2021-11-02-T-065,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Singapore economy contracted by 5.4% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, rose by 1.3%, as the total number of actual hours worked fell by a larger extent. This was due to the physical workplace closures implemented during the circuit breaker, as well as the subsequent phased resumption of activities last year. In the first half of 2021, labour productivity grew by 4.6% on a year-on-year basis, supported by the recovery in the Singapore economy.",1,1450,2021-11-02-T-065-S-01450

The westerly winds could have carried the foul odour from the farms and composting sites in Lim Chu Kang to the residential area in Woodlands, while light wind conditions overnight and in the early morning restricted the odour from dispersing, resulting in smell nuisance to residents.",2,1485,2021-11-02-T-074-S-01485
2021-11-02-T-074,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,Relevant agencies have been actively engaging the owners and occupiers of the identified premises to implement odour mitigation measures where feasible. Several agencies have also been piloting an initiative to work with members of the community to collect detailed smell feedback data. This would enable the agencies to better identify the sources of smell nuisance and work with the source premises to address the odour issue.,3,1486,2021-11-02-T-074-S-01486
2021-11-02-T-075,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Education in view of Singapore dealing with COVID-19 as an endemic and considering the significant disruption home-based learning (HBL) can cause, whether HBL can be minimised to facilitate interaction between students, CCA groups and other student groupings.",1,1487,2021-11-02-T-075-S-01487

2021-11-02-T-075,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE’s approach has always been to keep schools safe so that they can remain open as far as possible. We recognise that home-based learning (HBL) cannot be a full substitute for the school-based learning experience. During HBL, students are also less able to tap on their peers for support or take part in other activities, such as in-person Co-curricular Activities (CCAs), which are important for their holistic development.",1,1489,2021-11-02-T-075-S-01489
2021-11-02-T-075,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Schools mitigate the impact of HBL by leveraging technology to maintain social connections and minimise disruption to curriculum coverage. Teachers used online platforms and resources to conduct regular check-ins with students to monitor their well-being and to ensure continuity in their learning. Schools also remained open for high needs students and those without alternative care-giving arrangements during HBL.,2,1490,2021-11-02-T-075-S-01490
2021-11-02-T-075,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As we transit to living with COVID-19, our aim is to minimise HBL while safely resuming as many aspects of normal school life as we can. We will do so for students from Secondary schools and above first, given their high vaccination rates. Throughout the Stabilisation Phase, school-based learning continued for these older students under strict safe management measures (SMMs). After the national situation stabilises, a gradual return to normalcy may include resuming CCAs and larger school events first, with a view to allowing students to participate in important inter-school events next year, such as the National School Games.",3,1491,2021-11-02-T-075-S-01491

A key indicator which we are monitoring closely is the weekly infection growth rate, that is, the ratio of community cases in the past week over the week before. If the ratio goes below 1.0 and hospital/ICU situation remains stable, it will give us scope to relax restrictions. This will include resuming sports, school activities and allowing members from the same households to dine together at food and beverage (F&B) establishments without having to spread across multiple tables.",1,1519,2021-11-02-T-082-S-01519

As such, centre-based services, including exercise and cognitive activities, remain available, albeit with reduced capacities and safe management measures. We are working to augment these in light of the extended stabilisation phase. The People’s Association (PA) will also be piloting the resumption of selected activities for fully vaccinated seniors aged 60 and above.

Nonetheless, we recognise that not all seniors may be familiar with accessing services online and may face barriers.

2021-11-02-T-092,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Under the Strategy, five National AI Projects in logistics, smart estates, education, healthcare and border security, are now underway. These projects aim to harness the benefits of AI to increase productivity, raise the quality of public goods and bring about greater convenience, safety and security for Singaporeans. More National AI Projects in other domains are currently being explored.",2,1549,2021-11-02-T-092-S-01549
2021-11-02-T-092,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The intent is for these projects to catalyse AI adoption and innovation throughout the public and private sectors. To this end, we are working closely with industry stakeholders to build local AI capabilities. The Open Innovation Platform, which aggregates demand and scales solutions by connecting businesses with technology solution providers, regularly hosts AI-related challenges with problem statements from both the public and private sectors. Through the SMEs Go Digital programme, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can easily adopt pre-approved, sector-specific AI-enabled solutions.",3,1550,2021-11-02-T-092-S-01550
2021-11-02-T-092,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We want to do more to deepen our capabilities in both cutting-edge AI and the application of AI to real-life problems. Over the past five years, we have invested over $500 million in AI R&D. AI Singapore’s (AISG) “100 Experiments” programme brings together our Research Institutes and Institutes of Higher Learning with industry players to co-create and deploy AI solutions in commercial settings. AISG’s PhD Fellowship Programme supports top research talents to advance fundamental AI research here. More broadly, the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) helps Singaporeans to upgrade and acquire new tech skills. Since 2016, TeSA has placed more than 10,000 Singaporeans in good tech roles, including in AI, and will place another 5,500 over the next three years.",4,1551,2021-11-02-T-092-S-01551
2021-11-02-T-092,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,A trusted and progressive environment is critical as we grow our capability and use of AI.

2021-11-02-T-093,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Buildings accounted for about 11 CO  (,1,1556,2021-11-02-T-093-S-01556
2021-11-02-T-093,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To reduce embodied carbon in buildings, BCA will require building projects to implement a minimum number of sustainable construction practices, such as the use of low-carbon concrete and resource-efficient design, from 1 December 2021. On top of this, BCA’s voluntary Green Mark scheme promotes the reduction of a building’s carbon footprint over its entire lifecycle. The scheme encourages developers to assess the embodied and operational carbon of their building projects, use sustainable construction practices and materials and establish environmentally-friendly specifications in the fit out of their buildings.",2,1557,2021-11-02-T-093-S-01557
2021-11-02-T-093,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To facilitate companies’ access to green financing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Green and Sustainability-Linked Loans Grant Scheme (GSLS) in January this year. The scheme helps companies defray the cost of conducting independent assessments to validate the sustainability credentials of a loan. The GSLS also supports banks in the development of green and sustainability-linked loan frameworks. Such frameworks provide standardised criteria and processes for the assessment and issuance of loans to finance activities that contribute to sustainable development, such as the construction of green buildings.",3,1558,2021-11-02-T-093-S-01558
2021-11-02-T-093,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,BCA and MAS are also working with the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) and the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (REDAS) to build green financing capabilities in banks and built environment firms. This includes engaging banks on the Green Mark scheme and recognition of green building certification standards for meeting green financing requirements and conducting workshops to raise awareness on green financing schemes for built environment firms.,4,1559,2021-11-02-T-093-S-01559
2021-11-02-T-094,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for National Development in each year over the last 10 years, (a) what is the number of HDB flats eligible for resale within one year, five years and 10 years after the five-year minimum occupation period (MOP) respectively; and (b) what is the number of direct-purchase HDB flats sold within one year, five years and 10 years of meeting MOP respectively.",1,1560,2021-11-02-T-094-S-01560
2021-11-02-T-094,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Direct-purchase HDB flats are generally eligible for resale in the open market after the five-year minimum occupation period (MOP). The number of direct-purchase HDB flats that are eligible for resale after the MOP, and those that are sold within one year, five years and 10 years of meeting the MOP respectively, for each year over the last 10 years, is appended in Table 1.",1,1561,2021-11-02-T-094-S-01561

2021-11-02-T-095,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"asked the Minister for National Development what are the plans and measures taken to experiment, certify and deploy new construction materials, building capabilities or techniques to reduce construction costs and time to keep housing prices affordable.",1,1564,2021-11-02-T-095-S-01564
2021-11-02-T-095,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Innovation and technology are key enablers to support the transformation of the construction industry. BCA works closely with other agencies and the industry to facilitate the development and deployment of new solutions that can enhance construction productivity. Such solutions can potentially reduce time and costs for construction projects, including residential developments.",1,1565,2021-11-02-T-095-S-01565
2021-11-02-T-095,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For example, BCA is part of the multi-agency Built Environment Accelerate-to-Market Programme (BEAMP) for solution providers to work with the industry and public agencies to deploy their solutions. For the recently concluded cycle of the BEAMP in July 2021, eight innovators were awarded funding to develop solutions under themes, such as robotics and automation, advanced design and fabrication, and digital asset delivery and management. In addition, the multi-agency Building Innovation Panel (BIP) led by BCA acts as a one-stop platform to facilitate the regulatory clearances required for the deployment of new solutions to enhance construction productivity and sustainability.",2,1566,2021-11-02-T-095-S-01566
2021-11-02-T-095,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Changes in construction costs will not affect the prices of flats sold by HDB, as HDB does not price flats with reference to construction costs. Instead, HDB prices new flats with reference to the market value of flats. To ensure that new flats are affordable, especially for first-time buyers, HDB applies a significant subsidy to the assessed market values of new flats, so that new flats are priced below market. That said, BCA will continue to work closely with HDB to facilitate the deployment of new solutions in their projects through initiatives, such as the BEAMP.",3,1567,2021-11-02-T-095-S-01567
2021-11-02-T-096,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what cleanliness and hygiene standards apply to hotels deployed as COVID-19 quarantine facilities; and (b) what avenues of feedback and support are available to persons staying at such facilities who are concerned about cleanliness and hygiene.,1,1568,2021-11-02-T-096-S-01568
2021-11-02-T-096,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Hotels deployed as COVID-19 quarantine facilities are required to regularly clean their premises and guestrooms in line with standards set by MOH to safeguard the health of its staff and the Persons Under Quarantine. The standards specify the regularity and type of cleaning for each setting and situation to minimise transmission risk of COVID-19 within these facilities and into the community.,1,1569,2021-11-02-T-096-S-01569
2021-11-02-T-096,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MND conducts regular audits to ensure hotels comply with these standards and highlight specific areas for improvement. In addition, MND shares good practices and measures with its stakeholders to ensure that a high cleanliness and hygiene standard is observed across all quarantine facilities. Persons staying at quarantine facilities may provide feedback on cleanliness and hygiene matters directly to the hotel front desk or MOH’s Quarantine Order Agent hotline. All feedback will be assessed by MOH and MND thoroughly and the appropriate follow-up actions will be taken.",2,1570,2021-11-02-T-096-S-01570
2021-11-02-T-097,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the forthcoming legislation of existing TAFEP guidelines (a) whether there are adequate professionals and resources to implement enforcement and remedial action of claims in a timely manner; (b) how will the legislation address anxieties that may arise from the issue of unfairness which may be subjective or are driven by perception; and (c) how will the Ministry ensure that all claims are thoroughly investigated to avoid unnecessary compliance costs and Court processes.,1,1571,2021-11-02-T-097-S-01571
2021-11-02-T-097,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,The Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness’ deliberations involve defining the scope of future legislation and designing a legal framework that is balanced and in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans. This includes a claims process where mediation is the first and necessary step and appearance before the tribunal is a last resort to avoid the unintended consequence of fostering a litigious workplace culture. This has worked well for the handling of salary-related and wrongful dismissal cases.,1,1572,2021-11-02-T-097-S-01572
2021-11-02-T-097,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We agree with the Member that anxieties about workplace discrimination can also be driven by perceptions. Not every complaint means that the employer has done something wrong. That is why the mediation process, in itself, is an opportunity for employers and employees to close gaps in their understanding of requirements. Legislation must also go hand in hand with education efforts to change mindsets and attitudes towards inclusive and fair work practices.",2,1573,2021-11-02-T-097-S-01573
2021-11-02-T-097,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The reality is that trade-offs will need to be made as we develop an approach that aims to strike a balance between objectives that are in tension with each other. For example, while we want to ensure that claims are thoroughly investigated, which is time-consuming, we also want to make sure that the claims management process is efficient and not over-burdensome on workers and employers. This illustrates the difficult task being undertaken by the Tripartite Committee, which will have to manage such trade-offs.",3,1574,2021-11-02-T-097-S-01574
2021-11-02-T-097,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The Tripartite Committee aims to complete its work in the first half of 2022. The Government will then consider its recommendations and, if accepted, start work to prepare legislation and commit the necessary resources for the legislation to be implemented effectively. In the meantime, TAFEP and MOM will ensure the Tripartite Guidelines continue to be practised and upheld.",4,1575,2021-11-02-T-097-S-01575
2021-11-02-T-097,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,We thank the Member for his interest in the topic of workplace fairness and ask that Members continue to support the Tripartite Committee’s work and eventual recommendations.,5,1576,2021-11-02-T-097-S-01576
2021-11-02-T-098,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for the past three years, what is the number of reports filed by workers that they are made to work longer than that allowed under the Employment Act; (b) what have been the actions taken; and (c) how can the tripartite partners work together to protect workers from being overworked.",1,1577,2021-11-02-T-098-S-01577
2021-11-02-T-098,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Between 2018 and 2020, MOM received about 180 complaints each year on excessive working hours in breach of Part IV of the Employment Act.",1,1578,2021-11-02-T-098-S-01578
2021-11-02-T-098,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Enforcement action was taken against 65% of the cases, ranging from the issuance of warnings to fines, and prosecution for more serious cases. The rest of the complaints were either issued with an advisory for minor contraventions or were unsubstantiated.",2,1579,2021-11-02-T-098-S-01579
2021-11-02-T-098,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Enforcement is also complemented with education to raise awareness of both employers and employees. This is done through the Workright initiative which conducts annual education campaigns through various media platforms and on-the-ground roadshows in the heartlands.,3,1580,2021-11-02-T-098-S-01580
2021-11-02-T-098,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The tripartite partners come together to address deep-seated practices which may need to be changed. For example, the security industry used to routinely rely on overtime exemptions. The Security Tripartite Cluster studied this issue and took progressive steps to change industry practices and norms. This resulted in the industry being able to do away with overtime exemptions from January 2021.",4,1581,2021-11-02-T-098-S-01581

2021-11-02-T-099,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each year from 2018 to 2020, how many work pass holders reported their employers for not providing properly itemised payslips; (b) how many employers were found liable, with the percentage breakdown; (c) how many employers were repeat offenders; (d) whether, and, if so, what harsher penalties were imposed on these repeat offenders; and (e) whether the Ministry actively monitors employers’ compliance with the itemised payslip requirement and, if so, by what means.",1,1584,2021-11-02-T-099-S-01584
2021-11-02-T-099,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Between 2018 and 2020, MOM looked into an average of 100 complaints per year from work pass holders on the non-issuance of itemised payslips. Some complaints were lodged directly with MOM while others arose from salary disputes between employer and employee. A further 280 cases involving both foreign and local employees were detected from proactive inspections under the Workright initiative each year. In about 80% of the cases, including complaints, employers were formally notified to make the necessary rectifications. For the others, inquiries revealed that itemised payslips were available digitally or were issued late due to a lapse. No further action was taken for these cases. There were no repeat offenders.",1,1585,2021-11-02-T-099-S-01585
