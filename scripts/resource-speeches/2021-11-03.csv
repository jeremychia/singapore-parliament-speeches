2021-11-03-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Prime Minister in light of the disclosures in the Pandora Papers (a) whether MAS will be looking into the Singapore-based financial institutions and Singaporeans/foreigners who are implicated in the report; (b) whether any individual or financial institution will be asked to issue a clarification as to their activities disclosed in the report; and (c) how does MAS ensure that offshore wealth management services in Singapore remain lawful and legitimate by international standards.,1,4,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00004
2021-11-03-T-002,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether Singapore is implicated in the Pandora Papers; and (b) whether the Government is investigating whether Singapore entities or individuals residing in Singapore are involved in the alleged practices.,1,5,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00005
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to answer all the Parliamentary Questions (PQs) related to the recent disclosure by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) of confidential information, dubbed the “Pandora Papers” together. This includes Question Nos 1 and 2 from Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Patrick Tay filed for today’s Sitting, the Written PQ from Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling filed for today’s Sitting, and the Oral PQ from Mr Murali Pillai filed for yesterday’s Sitting.",1,6,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00006
2021-11-03-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please do.,1,7,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00007
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, as a global financial centre, Singapore intermediates a large volume of fund flows for investment or commercial purposes and also provides services in financial asset management. While the vast majority of these activities are carried out by law-abiding individuals and companies, we are constantly on guard against the risk of illicit financing activities.",1,8,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00008
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) continually monitors and analyses information from a wide range of sources as part of its surveillance of money laundering and terrorism financing risks. This includes suspicious transactions reports filed by our financial institutions (FIs), information from intelligence sources, including those abroad and publicly available information such as from independent investigations and media reports. MAS therefore takes seriously the recent disclosures in the Pandora Papers.",2,9,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00009
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The ICIJ has reported that 336 prominent individuals from around the world had established offshore structures to hold assets, assisted by 14 service providers operating in at least 38 jurisdictions. Two of the 14 service providers are foreign-incorporated trust companies with subsidiaries in Singapore that are licensed and regulated by MAS. Some ICIJ media reports also mentioned that many of these individuals had foreign bank accounts linked to these structures, in various financial centres including Singapore.",3,10,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00010
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Based on MAS’ assessment and information available thus far, the Pandora Papers have not raised significant concerns over the money laundering and counter terrorism financing (AML/CFT) controls of our FIs. Nevertheless, MAS is engaging the relevant FIs to assess if tightening of controls are warranted.",4,11,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00011
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As ICIJ itself is careful to acknowledge, there are legitimate reasons to set up offshore structures, such as for investment and estate management. However, offshore structures often lack transparency and are thus vulnerable to abuse for illicit activities. Hence, MAS has clear requirements for FIs in Singapore to identify and verify the identities of persons who are beneficial owners or effective controllers of their customer accounts. FIs must understand the reasons for the use of such structures, take measures to ascertain that the assets held in these structures are not illicit and scrutinise any unusual transactions as part of their ongoing monitoring of the account.",5,12,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00012
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MAS also supervises the FIs to ensure that their boards and management have implemented robust controls against money laundering and terrorism financing. Where there are breaches of AML/CFT requirements, MAS has taken strong enforcement action.",6,13,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00013
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, both the licensed trust companies in Singapore mentioned in the Pandora Papers have already been subject to MAS’ supervisory or enforcement actions. One of them, Asiaciti Trust (Singapore) Pte Ltd, paid a composition penalty of $1.1 million imposed by MAS in July last year for its failure to implement adequate AML/CFT policies and procedures. The other trust company, Trident Trust Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was directed by MAS in September last year to remediate weaknesses detected in its risk assessment controls during MAS’ supervisory surveillance. Both companies were under intensified scrutiny by MAS before they were mentioned in the Pandora Papers.",7,14,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00014
2021-11-03-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me assure this House that Singapore takes the integrity of our financial sector very seriously. As a major international financial centre, Singapore will always face the risk of illicit financial flows. What is important is that we supervise our FIs well, and take strong enforcement actions where necessary to reduce this risk as much as possible. MAS has been doing this and will continue to do so.",8,15,2021-11-03-T-002-S-00015
2021-11-03-T-003,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling,"asked the Minister for Transport in light of the new COVID-19 protocols where patients waiting for their polymerase chain reaction test results should return home via private transport, what are the measures taken to protect our point-to-point drivers when they are ferrying such passengers.",1,16,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00016
2021-11-03-T-003,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are adequate taxis and private transport to ferry passengers to and return from Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinics; (b) whether the drivers are sufficiently protected; and (c) whether the vehicles are kept sanitised and safe.,1,17,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00017
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 3 and 4 together?",1,18,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00018
2021-11-03-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,19,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00019
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you. Persons who feel unwell and are travelling to and from their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test venue are required to commute via private transport, which includes taxis or private hire cars (PHCs). As these persons are taking regular taxis or PHCs, there is an adequate supply to meet their needs.",1,20,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00020
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These passengers should inform their taxi and PHC drivers about their health status so that the drivers may take appropriate precautions. Drivers have been advised to switch off the air-con when ferrying these passengers, wind down their windows during and after each trip, and clean their vehicles after the trips. Passengers should also sit at the back, diagonally from the drivers.",2,21,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00021
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"MOH has assessed that these measures are sufficient to minimise the risk of in-vehicle transmission of the virus and there is no need for extra precautionary measures, such as having drivers put on full personal protective equipment. Furthermore, about 98% of our taxi and PHC drivers are fully vaccinated.",3,22,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00022
2021-11-03-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.,1,23,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00023
2021-11-03-T-003,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive and very empathetic answer. Our P2P drivers have been very supportive of our journey to the endemic phase and appreciates the Government's continued support of this industry during this period. Given that our P2P drivers will be ferrying more patients and passengers who are exposed to the virus, would the Government be putting in measures to have the taxis and platform companies put in clearer safety SOPs or protocols for drivers and their vehicles? And should our P2P drivers have to self-isolate, will there be additional support for them, given that they would have difficulties with the daily rentals of their vehicles during this isolation period?",1,24,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00024
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. We note the concerns of the drivers. We have received the feedback from the drivers, the associations and NTUC about ferrying unwell or Ag+ passengers.",1,25,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00025
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have worked with MOH who will remind the passengers to declare their health status to the drivers so that the drivers can take the necessary precautions to further minimise the risks of in-vehicle transmission of the virus. MOH has put this information up on their website in their FAQs on Health Protocols. So, this is already up. LTA will be putting it up on our website. LTA is also working with the operators and the associations to publicise this message to the drivers as well as the passengers.",2,26,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00026
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, for instance, sending emails to the database of passengers to remind them to declare their health status so that the drivers can take action and also to remind the drivers of the additional precautions that they can take. We are also working with the operators to see if we can craft a message that can be printed out and the drivers can opt to display it in their vehicles to remind the passengers. This is what we are doing to give assurance to the drivers.",3,27,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00027
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to support for the drivers, the operators have various measures to provide support to the drivers who either are tested positive for COVID-19 and cannot drive or they are required to self-isolate and therefore, cannot drive. All the taxi operators provide rental waivers for the drivers who cannot drive due to COVID-19 or if they have to self-isolate. The two biggest PHC operators – Grab and Gojek – provide prolonged medical leave insurance coverage for the drivers. This involves financial payouts if the drivers are not able to drive for these reasons.",4,28,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00028
2021-11-03-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition to that, drivers who contract COVID-19 as a result of providing services in a heightened COVID-19 risk situation – for instance, ferrying Ag+ passengers for their PCR tests – they can apply for a one-time relief of $3,000 through The Courage Fund for frontliners that is administered by the National Council of Social Service.",5,29,2021-11-03-T-003-S-00029
2021-11-03-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is Singapore’s inflation outlook in the near and medium terms; (b) what are the causes of the rising inflationary pressures; (c) what is the assessment of the likely impact of these inflationary pressures on low and middle income households; and (d) whether there will be mitigating measures to reduce the impact of rising costs arising from these inflationary pressures on households and businesses.,1,30,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00030
2021-11-03-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the risk of a sharp accumulation of external and domestic cost pressures affecting prices of goods and services in Singapore; and (b) other than tighter monetary policy, what steps can be taken to mitigate some of the effects of rising costs over the next 12 months.",1,31,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00031
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Speaker, Sir, with your permission, can I take Question Nos 5 and 6 together, please?",1,32,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00032
2021-11-03-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,33,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00033
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"CPI-All Items inflation picked up to 2.5% on a year-on-year basis in Q32021, from 2.3% in Q2. The rise in domestic inflation came largely on the back of higher external inflation due to increases in global energy and food commodity prices, and persistent supply bottlenecks in key global industries and transport hubs.",1,34,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00034
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the energy front, crude oil prices have risen to above US$80 per barrel since early October on account of the decision by OPEC+ to keep supply increases modest, even as oil demand continues to pick up due to the global economic recovery and the rally in global natural gas prices. Higher oil and gas prices will translate to higher electricity prices domestically. And about 95% of our electricity is currently generated using natural gas. That is on the energy front.",2,35,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00035
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the food front, global prices for food commodities such as cereals and vegetable oil have risen due to supply constraints arising from weather-related disruptions, manpower and labour shortages and export restrictions in key food-producing countries, amidst rising global demand. Higher global food prices will in turn, naturally, exert upward pressure on domestic food prices.",3,36,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00036
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Meanwhile, supply bottlenecks for goods such as semiconductors, and congestion at ports around the world, have contributed to a rise in the prices of imported consumer goods in Singapore.",4,37,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00037
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Domestically, we expect labour costs to rise as the labour market continues to recover and border restrictions limit non-resident worker inflow. We also expect to see inflation in accommodation to persist due to strong rental demand for housing amidst construction delays caused by labour shortages in the construction sector. Against this backdrop, CPI-All Items inflation is projected to come in at around 2% this year and average 1.5% to 2.5% in 2022.",5,38,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00038
2021-11-03-T-004,,,"But despite this rise in inflation, Singapore’s economic recovery for the year remains on track. Barring a major setback in the global economy, GDP growth is expected to come in between 6% and 7% for the full year, mainly supported by outward-oriented sectors, such as the manufacturing, finance and insurance, and information and communications sectors.",1,39,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00039
2021-11-03-T-004,,,"The Government recognises that higher inflation is a cause of concern for Singaporeans, particularly those in lower-income households. To manage the cost of living pressures faced by Singaporeans, the Government adopts a multi-pronged approach.",2,40,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00040
2021-11-03-T-004,,,"First, in view of the external and domestic cost pressures, MAS recently announced a shift towards an appreciating path for the trade-weighted Singapore dollar – the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. A strong Singapore dollar will help to mitigate imported inflation and temper domestic cost, to ensure price stability over the medium term. That is one.",3,41,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00041
2021-11-03-T-004,,,"Second, the Government strives to maintain and manage domestic supply-side constraints, and these include the supply of industrial and commercial spaces to help moderate business cost increases, and reduce the knock-on impact on consumer prices. During the pandemic, the Government has also disbursed rental relief to help businesses cope with their rental costs. In addition, policy measures, such as the Wage Credit Scheme, Jobs Support Scheme and Jobs Growth Incentive Scheme, provide some support for businesses in terms of their manpower and labour costs.",4,42,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00042
2021-11-03-T-004,,,"Third, to mitigate the impact of rising global food prices, the Government has diversified our food import sources to help ensure that the prices of our food supplies remain competitive.",5,43,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00043
2021-11-03-T-004,,,"Fourth, we will continue to pay particular attention to Singaporeans from lower-income households who need support for their basic living expenses. The Government will continue to provide assistance through ComCare and the permanent GST Voucher scheme. From time to time, the Government also introduces one-off support measures, such as the Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme. In addition, Singaporeans from lower- to middle-income households who have experienced involuntary job or income loss due to the economic impact of COVID-19 can apply for financial assistance provided through schemes, such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and the Courage Fund.",6,44,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00044
2021-11-03-T-004,,,The Government will continue to monitor inflation and cost of living pressures closely and adjust our policies where necessary.,7,45,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00045
2021-11-03-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his detailed answers. I have just one supplementary question and somewhat related to Question No 5 as well. Beyond the mitigation measures that the Minister of State mentioned just now – we are thankful for the support for expenses and other mitigation measures – can he give an update on other pre-emptive efforts?",1,46,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00046
2021-11-03-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"For example, the Retail Price Watch Group (RPWG). An update on that would be quite useful. Slightly more than a decade ago, we created that to keep a watch on retail prices and address concerns on any alleged profiteering and excessive pricing of daily necessities and food items. And the role of cooperation with retailers going forward, as a price stabiliser, I think that element of pre-emptive efforts might be useful at this point in time as we proceed into 2022. If we can have further updates from the Minister of State, please.",2,47,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00047
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his s upplementary question. The Government maintains a very strong vigilant stance on price increases and price fluctuations. The Retail Price Watch Group that the Member mentioned has stood down but we have other measures and ways of monitoring the price of goods. For daily necessities, consumers can make use of CASE's Price Kaki app to compare prices of groceries and hawker food to help them to make more informed purchasing decisions.",1,48,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00048
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"To also help Singaporeans cope with higher prices for their daily necessities, the Government continues to work with cooperatives, such as NTUC FairPrice and community support programmes, such as the price freezes on essential items under house brands over the period of March 2019 to December 2020.",2,49,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00049
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"But as I have mentioned earlier on, I wanted to just reinforce that it is a whole multi-prong approach, a broad and expansive approach that the Government is taking to tackle inflation.",3,50,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00050
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"We have mentioned earlier on MAS' monetary policy adjustments, the Government managing supply-site constraints, which is not unique to Singapore but globally. Third, is diversifying food import sources and energy sources over the long term, as we have debated in the House for the last two days. And of course, our particular focus and assistance to lower-income households, including, for example, U-Save vouchers for households living in for 4-room or smaller HDB flats to help them with utility bills.",4,51,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00051
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"So, our approach has been multi-pronged. Our approach has been wide and expansive and broad to help our people to cope with inflation.",5,52,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00052
2021-11-03-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.,1,53,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00053
2021-11-03-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, the Minister of State mentioned about monetary policy as one of the very important tools to fight imported inflation. So, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether there is further scope for our strong Singapore dollar to mitigate imported inflation, given that it does impact our export competitiveness; whether, from our trade consideration standpoint, is there further room for that to be used to mitigate imported inflation?",1,54,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00054
2021-11-03-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Secondly, besides imported inflation, we are also faced with domestic cost pressures. The Minister of State also mentioned about the push for higher wages, the additional measures from the COVID-19-related safe management procedures that the businesses got to follow, the energy prices and others. My concern is whether all these upward pressures on cost will lead to businesses pricing in this anticipated increase in cost and, therefore, will create a spiral in inflation. So, I would like to ask the Minister of State how the Government is going to manage this, whether there will be interventions and also for items that are outside the CPI basket, how are we going to mitigate those cost increases as well.",2,55,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00055
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I t hank the Member for his supplementary questions. As we all know, inflation is a clear and present issue confronting and vexing economists this week, as well as central bankers and policy-makers. If you look at it, US consumer price inflation is at 5.4%, the highest in 13 years. South Korea just announced that inflation hit a 10-year high in October.",1,56,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00056
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"As I earlier updated, MAS had already made a decisive move on 14 October by raising the slope of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. It had also said that it would continue to track the growth and inflation trajectories over the next few quarters.",2,57,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00057
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"This is one tool in the toolbox; there are many others. And maybe I will just share with the Member how we are dealing with inflationary issues. If you look at the thing as a whole, this issue has been more acute because of two major challenges. The first is that the supply-side constraints and the second is an economic rebound.",3,58,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00058
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The supply-side constraints have been in place, pre-COVID-19, but accentuated during COVID-19. The economic pick-up will lead to pent-up demand, economic rebounding, and so, you have huge demand but then, continued supply constraints. If you look at what is happening right now, despite all of these input prices, our exports have in fact seen a very strong recovery this year. Our non-oil domestic exports (NODX) increased 9.1% year-on-year in Q3 2021, following the 10.1% expansion in Q2 2021. This NODX growth in Q3 2021 was driven mainly by exports of non-electronic products such as specalised machinery, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.",4,59,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00059
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"When our export performance is strong, it means also that our exports remain competitive in international markets. And we must keep these markets open so that our goods can flow out. It also manages a hedge against other price increases, inbound. How do we do so? The Member knows that we have undertaken a whole slew and suite of major trade facilitation and multilateral frameworks, such as RCEP, CPTPP. These build upon our existing FTAs with major trade partners, representing 85% of global GDP.",5,60,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00060
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"At the same time, the other way to manage this is to ensure that our supply chains remain connected and that means diversifying our import and export markets. We have and are negotiating, and have successfully concluded negotiations on the Pacific Alliance Singapore Free Trade Agreement. It is another arrow in our quiver such that we can open up new markets for our imports to alleviate, again, inflationary pressures. We will also continue to support local enterprises so they can deepen their export capabilities in the global economy and ensure our exports remain relevant and competitive in the international market in the long term.",6,61,2021-11-03-T-004-S-00061
2021-11-03-T-004,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The other aspects to reduce inflationary pressures include also the supply of industrial and commercial spaces to help moderate business costs and reduce the knock-on impact on consumer prices.

2021-11-03-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Government expects that ComCare cash assistance will remain elevated for the 2021 financial year.,1,63,2021-11-03-T-005-S-00063
2021-11-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Speaker, in FY2020, MSF disbursed $236 million in ComCare assistance, a 56% increase from FY2019’s $151 million. The number of individuals who benefited from ComCare schemes also increased by 22% over the same period, to around 96,000 individuals in FY2020.",1,64,2021-11-03-T-005-S-00064
2021-11-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"These increases were largely due to the larger number of ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) beneficiaries in FY2020 and reflected the economic impact of COVID-19 as well as the additional flexibility that Social Service Offices (SSOs) exercised during the pandemic to provide ComCare support. For instance, MSF automatically extended the duration of support of existing ComCare beneficiaries whose assistance ended between May and October 2020 by a further six months, to provide them with a longer runway to stabilise their circumstances. Most new ComCare beneficiaries assisted between April and December 2020 also received at least six months of assistance.",2,65,2021-11-03-T-005-S-00065
2021-11-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"SMTA supports low-income and vulnerable individuals and families who may be looking for work, are temporarily unable to work or are earning a low income and require financial assistance. SMTA beneficiaries receive comprehensive support, which may include cash assistance for their basic living expenses, and assistance with their household and medical bills. They may also receive employment assistance such as job search and/or training and be assisted through referrals to other government agencies and community partners for casework and counselling. These help the families to tide over their temporary financial difficulty and support them in their journey to regain stability and self-reliance.",3,66,2021-11-03-T-005-S-00066
2021-11-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"In line with the improving economic and labour market situation, the ComCare data for the first six months of FY2021 show that the number of beneficiaries has steadily decreased since FY2020. We do not expect the number of ComCare beneficiaries or quantum disbursed in FY2021 to remain at the FY2020 levels, although it may still be higher than pre-COVID-19 levels in FY2019.",4,67,2021-11-03-T-005-S-00067

We welcome everyone to step forward and volunteer with us in various initiatives as well. They can register their interest through www.volunteer.gov.sg.

Sir, my Clementi resident told me she has just been retrenched, with her last day of work in December. Her Primary 6 daughter is on school-based FAS and she is worried about what will happen in the new school.

Firstly, for school-based FAS, is there any way to facilitate handover of school-based FAS needy students between the old and new school, especially when these postings happen? Secondly, for MOE FAS, is there any way for MOE to consider pre-application requests from parents who have already received notice of retrenchment just before the end of the school year?",2,75,2021-11-03-T-006-S-00075
2021-11-03-T-006,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his question. I would like to share that if he comes across residents who, unfortunately, need financial assistance, one immediate port of call can be ComCare, because MSF and MOE have established an arrangement since 2018 for students in mainstream schools, ITEs and Polytechnics to be concurrently assessed for financial assistance, when the Social Service Offices (SSOs) actually review their families' application for ComCare. In other words, if the resident that Dr Tan Wu Meng mentioned approaches ComCare, ComCare, through SSOs, would actually facilitate an application through the SSOs for financial assistance, as well as help with the application for school-based FAS.",1,76,2021-11-03-T-006-S-00076
2021-11-03-T-006,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The other point I wanted to mention on school-based FAS is, the specific example that Dr Tan had mentioned was because the student was a graduating student in Primary 6 and would be posting to a Secondary school or another school, and perhaps, at that point in time, it was not yet clear which school the student would be posted to. But I would just like to assure the Member that the MOE directs funds specifically towards the schools to administer school-based FAS, which is over and above the MOE FAS that I was talking about. So, once there is clarity as to which school the child would be posted to, then when the child applies for school-based FAS, the school specifically will make those assessments and ensure that the funds are paid in an expeditious manner to the student.",2,77,2021-11-03-T-006-S-00077

During the recent full Home-Based Learning in May 2021, schools loaned out Internet-enabling devices to students who lacked Internet access at home. Students also had the option to return to school to use computing facilities.

One question is, given the proliferation of more digital and online educational resources and the increase in home-based learning, I was wondering whether the Ministry will consider further expanding the provision for Home Access programmes beyond the two years to better serve those in disadvantaged circumstances and give them more accessibility, especially outside of school and having to be at home?",1,84,2021-11-03-T-007-S-00084

And this applies also to the NEU PC Plus programmes. I understand his concerns and we are committed to equip all Singaporeans with the basic affordable digital access.

HDB also provides features, such as three-generation playgrounds, where playgrounds for children are located beside fitness stations for adults and seniors. For better wayfinding, HDB has started designing estates with features to facilitate easier recognition of places, such as larger font sizes for block numbers and the use of icons.

2021-11-03-T-010,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"First, he asked about the growth outlook by sector. Growth will continue to be driven by outward-oriented sectors, like manufacturing, wholesale trade, finance and insurance and information and communications technology (ICT). The recovery in tourism related, aviation related or consumer-facing sector is projected to be gradual, in comparison.",2,116,2021-11-03-T-010-S-00116
2021-11-03-T-010,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"He asked about the business formation numbers in sectors. Let me just give him a bit of insights to this. Business formations continue to flourish, in spite of the COVID-19 crisis. Earlier on, I cited the numbers, the formation number and the number of firms that closed. More new businesses have started compared to the number of businesses closed. Between March 2020 and September 2021, over this one-and-a-half year period, a total of 73,036 business entities have ceased while 103,585 business entities have formed. So, again, more business formation numbers.",3,117,2021-11-03-T-010-S-00117
2021-11-03-T-010,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In the same period, he asked about sectors, the sectors with the largest number of new businesses formed included professional services, wholesale trade and retail.",4,118,2021-11-03-T-010-S-00118
2021-11-03-T-010,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"His second supplementary question is on sustainability. I have cited about digitalisation, internationalisation, innovation; and he correctly pointed out the sustainability is going to be important as a competitive advantage for our SMEs. And indeed, we are encouraging our SMEs to integrate sustainability into their business, into their business process as a competitive advantage and to grow their capabilities in the new economy by tapping on the newly launched Enterprise Sustainability Programme. It was launched by Minister Gan Kim Yong about a month back on the 1 October. It is a $180 million-dollar scheme. So, what does it entail?",5,119,2021-11-03-T-010-S-00119
2021-11-03-T-010,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The Enterprise Sustainability Programme supports our SMEs in a few areas  (a) in sustainability training; (b) capability development; and (c) product development. And also, in the month of October, ESG launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme–Green which will then catalyse funding for our SMEs to develop green solutions and technology. The Enterprise Sustainability Programme does not just support our SMEs at the enterprise level. It is very important for us to also take a sectoral view and an ecosystem-wide approach.",6,120,2021-11-03-T-010-S-00120
2021-11-03-T-010,,,"So, MTI and ESG will certainly work very closely with the trade associations and chambers (TACs), industry partners, to develop a vibrant sustainability ecosystem to support our SMEs in their sustainability efforts, from capability development to product development. At the same time, taking an ecosystem-wide approach to leverage key enablers like financing, certification, training and other sustainability services.",1,121,2021-11-03-T-010-S-00121

2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"From January 2020 to September 2021, 8,600 retail businesses ceased operations. This was 330 more than the same period between 2018 and 2019. However, there were 15,570 new retail businesses set up, resulting in a net increase of 6,970 retail firms over the same period from January 2020 to September 2021.",1,124,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00124

For example, the number of licensed hotels today remains at around 420 despite 13 hotels having ceased operations. The total number of licensed tourist guides is still around 2,900, even with 175 tourist guides choosing not to renew their licences during this period. Travel agents, unfortunately, have been impacted more – 157 travel agents ceased their operations. This represent 8% of all licensed travel agents, although around 30 new travel agents entered the market.",2,125,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00125

Together with other broad-based Government support measures, this has helped cushion the impact of COVID-19 on the sector. Initiatives such as the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers (SRV) scheme have also helped stimulate demand by encouraging Singaporeans to rediscover our city, our tourism product offerings and support local tourism businesses, including those for travel agents.",3,126,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00126
2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The launch of the SRV scheme has also helped tourist guides. Between the launch of the SRV scheme and the start of the Heightened Alert in May 2021, monthly tour participants grew fivefold from just over 10,000 to more than 50,000. To further help our tourist guides cope with business costs, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) also waived the tourist guide licence fees in 2020 and 2021, as well as test fees for those who wish to be licensed in another language.",4,127,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00127

2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"With regard to retailers, for retailers looking to develop their online sales channels, they can receive support from Enterprise Singapore’s (ESG) E-Commerce Booster Package, which defrays the costs of joining e-commerce platforms, or use ESG’s Productivity Solutions Grant to build capabilities in areas such as digital marketing as well as e-commerce. The tourism sector is also receiving support from STB to pursue transformation efforts to ready itself for the recovery. Examples include the Business Improvement Fund for technology innovation and the adoption of business models and processes to improve productivity and competitiveness; and the Training Industry Professionals in Tourism scheme which supports employee upgrading and talent and leadership development.",6,129,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00129

2021-11-03-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My supplementary question is, in particular, about those working in the tourism and retail sector. I have a number of residents who used to work or are working in the tourism and retail sectors, which have been in partial limbo over the past one and a half years. My question is, whether we have the number of tour guides or retail frontline workers who have switched industries or switched jobs permanently.",2,132,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00132
2021-11-03-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Can I also ask about the status of our local travel agencies in Singapore, and if they will survive, going forward? Also, what outlook can we expect for the retail sector and the travel agency business in this endemic scenario that we are going to face over the next year or so?",3,133,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00133
2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Let me go to our tourism sector first. Between January 2020 and 20 October 2021, 4,373 workers were retrenched across the core tourism industries, 58% of whom were locals. However, with early intervention and support under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Initiative, 67% of the locals, who were retrenched between January and September 2020, found new employment within six months.",1,134,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00134

2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"As I mentioned earlier on in my reply, the SRV scheme has also helped local tourist guides with monthly tour participants growing fivefold between the launch of the SRV scheme and the start of the Heightened Alert in May 2021. I also mentioned earlier on STB waiving the tourist guide licence fees as well as test fees.",3,136,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00136
2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"So, all of these in concert, and all of these in totality, are helping preserve our capability in our tourism sector, which is an important sector, while we await the recovery in global travel as well as the tourism industry. But we must preserve this. The SRV, for example, helps us to create new product offerings locally, with tourist guides forming new products. I think it will put them in good stead for when travel resumes in earnest, and when tourists come to Singapore and are able to enjoy the sights and sounds here in Singapore.",4,137,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00137
2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Just back to the retail question. In 2020, 1,180 retail employees had been retrenched. This translates to 16.9 retrenched employees per 1,000 employees. Of these retrenched employees, 56% were able to enter a different industry within six months after retrenchment.",5,138,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00138

2021-11-03-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The Retail ITM has done a study and they have looked across the key trends in the retail industry. The key trends are digitalisation, on-demand retail, hyper-personalisation of goods, in effect, and conscious consumerism, which is very much related to the sustainability trend that we are seeing. So, we are supporting our retail sector to take on and to ride these trends, moving forward.",7,140,2021-11-03-T-011-S-00140

2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"In 2020, labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, or AHW, rose for outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and finance and insurance. For example, the productivity of the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors increased by 18.6% and 3.1%, respectively. By contrast, sectors which were severely disrupted by travel and domestic restrictions, such as construction, transportation and storage, accommodation and F&B services, experienced declines in productivity. In particular, the productivity of the transportation and storage and F&B services sectors fell by 22.1% and 17.7%, respectively.",2,143,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00143
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"For 2021, productivity growth is expected to remain positive for the most outward-oriented sectors, given the pick-up in global economic activity. Sectors that continue to be disrupted by weak travel demand and domestic restrictions such as transportation and storage and F&B services, are not likely to return to pre-COVID-19 productivity levels, as activities in these sectors are not expected to recover fully this year.",3,144,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00144
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Since 2015, MTI has compiled statistics on real value-added per actual hour worked, to complement statistics on real value-added per worker.

2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"In the context of a hybrid model of working, real value-added per actual hour worked also provides a more accurate measure of labour productivity, as it accounts for the varying intensity of labour input by employees under different types of work arrangements. These include (a) flexi-time arrangements that grant employees flexible work schedules, depending on their work, of course, and personal commitments; (b) flexi-load arrangements that involve employees who are hired on a part-time or project basis; as well as (c) flexi-place arrangements that allow employees to telecommute and record hours worked in both workplace settings and at home.",5,146,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00146

2021-11-03-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First is in relation to my earlier Parliamentary Question (PQ), can the Minister of State share about the outlook for the productivity by sector, if possible, in 2022; and beyond 2022, given growth and other variables?",2,149,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00149
2021-11-03-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second supplementary question I have is, in relation to the second part of my PQ. Are there plans for MTI to do any further granular data studies to examine productivity, in terms of both labour and multi-factor productivity, especially during the COVID-19 period and possibly into the endemic period? The reason is, if we look at the actual hours worked data, which is good that it is in quarterly basis, whether there will be more measures that MTI plans to collect, going forward, similar to what other developed countries like in the US, so as to measure productivity more accurately, going forward?",3,150,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00150
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,I thank the Member for his two supplementary questions. I will take the measurement of labour productivity first and then go into the outlook across sectors.,1,151,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00151
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"First is on how is labour productivity typically measured and what are the differences between existing labour productivity measures? Labour productivity measures actually measure how effectively or efficiently labour inputs are used to produce output. They are computed in terms of, as I mentioned, real value-added (VA) per actual hour worked, or real VA per worker. There are differences between these two because of changes in the average number of hours worked per worker over time. I think that also has been quite accentuated during COVID-19.",2,152,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00152
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Of the two measures that we talked about, real VA per AHW is recognised internationally including, as I mentioned earlier, by ILO, to be a better measure of labour productivity, because the actual hours will capture the intensity of labour input more accurately.",3,153,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00153
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"In Singapore's context, this measure has also become more relevant in recent years with the rising number of part-time workers in the economy and the cyclical changes in the number of hours worked by full-time workers.",4,154,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00154
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"If you look at TFP or Total Factor Productivity, which is also known as multi-factor productivity, is also an alternate measure of productivity and captures how efficiently both capital and labour are used together in the production process. It is computed as a residual on an annual basis and is defined as a change in GDP not attributed to changes in capital and labour inputs.",5,155,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00155
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"So, for example, an increase in TFP may be due to factors such as a rise in technology, improvements in management practices and organisational structures or maybe even the diffusion of technology across firms. So, while not a 100% accurate indication, I think this particular measure, for now, manages to capture productivity in the most accurate form. But we will be open to looking at other ways to measure, given the changing nature of work across the world and given how COVID-19 has also looked at productivity across workplace and at home.",6,156,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00156
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regards to the outlook for productivity, both Minister of State Low and myself have shared earlier on that the growth as well as recovery across sectors are uneven. There are domestically oriented sectors and there are the outwardly oriented sectors. The domestically oriented sectors experienced a steeper contraction in value-add in 2020, a reduction in 15.9% as compared to the outward oriented sector's decrease in 0.9%. But our productivity performance tends to be pro-cyclical and so it has resulted in an uneven productivity across various sectors.",7,157,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00157
2021-11-03-T-012,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I wanted to also just share a little bit that what we are doing is we are not being stagnant in this regard, productivity has been an issue in advanced economies and in particular, Singapore has been managing or trying to increase productivity for decades.",8,158,2021-11-03-T-012-S-00158
2021-11-03-T-013,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for Manpower what measures will be implemented to alleviate the disruptions to our manpower resources, particularly in sectors such as cleaning and hospitality which will experience higher labour demand in tandem with more visitors entering Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Lane schemes.",1,159,2021-11-03-T-013-S-00159
2021-11-03-T-013,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mr Speaker, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our economy and labour market.

At the same time, some foreign workers who were already in Singapore have returned home. In the first half of 2021, the total number of foreign workers continued to decline by another 32,600. All of this had led to increasing tightness in the labour market. The number of seasonally adjusted job vacancies in the overall economy rose to an all-time high of 92,100 in June 2021. The number of vacancies is especially acute in sectors which rely most on foreign workers, such as construction and manufacturing. The seasonally adjusted job vacancy to unemployed person ratio increased to 1.63 in June 2021, exceeding one for the first time since March 2019.",2,161,2021-11-03-T-013-S-00161

Clearly, employers are putting their workers' lives at risk when ferrying them at the back of lorries especially when some of these lorry drivers have the propensity to speed and it could be down to just sheer luck that there has not been even more fatalities on our roots.",2,181,2021-11-03-T-015-S-00181

2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Firstly, can I use this opportunity to seek an update on the outstanding amount of securities that the Government issued under the GSA and the LTBA?",6,224,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00224
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Secondly, clause 14 of the Act merge the two borrowing limits, the GSA and the LBTA, into a single borrowing limit of $1.065 trillion. Can I ask the Minister for the basis of this change?",7,225,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00225
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),The reasons for my question are as follows.,8,226,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00226
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Firstly, SGS are long-dated debts greater than one year, while the Treasury Bills tends to be just a few months to a year. Both debts come with different tenures, repayment obligations. The Treasury Bills tend to be more liquid in the trading markets because it is shorter dated. Hence, from the credit market standpoint, the two debts, say, the three-month Treasury Bill versus 20-year SGS would be accorded with different risk ratings.",9,227,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00227
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),Does MOF see the need to retain this separate borrowing limits for these two buckets of issuances given that they both have different risk profile?,10,228,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00228
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"My third question is, the main bulk of the securities issued by the Government is the Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) which I believe account for about over 70% of the SGS. This is issued to CPF Board so that the Government can pay the bond coupon rates to the CPF members, which match the interest that CPF members receive. These bonds are not traded in the market and are directly placed with CPF. Hence, this is not for the purpose of creating high quality liquid assets for the financial institutions or to build a domestic risk-free yield curve, as opposed to the purpose of SGS.",11,229,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00229
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Because of its sheer size, this SSGS, and that it will continue to grow in tandem with higher wages and growth in our resident workforce, we can expect the SSGS to get even more sizeable as the CPF savings increase.",12,230,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00230
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"As the SSGS is aggregated with the SGS, the overall debt level of the Government will come across as very high relative to our GDP and give the impression that a lot more SGS is issued or traded in the market.",13,231,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00231
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"These CPF related issuances, the SSGS, are also not invested by external investors because it is hold by the CPF Board, and its size of issuance and coupon rates therefore do not have any impact on the Singapore bond market nor its liquidity.",14,232,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00232
2021-11-03-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Hence, I would suggest that MOF consider classifying these private placed securities which it privately placed to CPF Board as CPF Bond rather than called it the SGS, and it should come under a separate borrowing limit and, of course, to be approved by Parliament and the President.",15,233,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00233

2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The first point worth noting is that clause 14 with the Bill proposes to set the borrowing limit for Government loans at $1.065 trillion, which represents the combined limits of $960 billion for the Government securities and $105 billion Treasury Bills that currently exists under two separate Acts. This new limit may then be increased by Parliamentary resolution, which simplifies, since logically, all forms of debt, whether short-term or long-term should, of course, be treated as a component of the overall liability picture and, hence, subject to the same form of debt ceiling discipline.",3,238,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00238

2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"So, the natural objection, of course, is this, is that the Government maintains these separate limits for debt that serve developmental objectives, such as infrastructure, which is the case for SINGA versus those issued under risk transfer and investment purposes for the purposes of CPF funds as mentioned earlier, or to fulfil liquidity and debt functions.",6,241,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00241
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"MOF has steadfastly held that all these require separate limit accounts. But from the perspective of understanding the underlying economics, all monies is ultimately fungible and it is unclear why debt issued under one type of accounting constraint cannot subsequently be redeployed to other functions so long as it is only a matter of protocol, rather than one entrenched in actual legislation that prevents subsequent transfer.",7,242,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00242
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Of course, such deviations need not occur under this Government but it could easily occur under another perhaps more profligate one. Hence, even if we did wish to maintain separate debt ceilings for the purposes of accounting, perhaps it may be worth nevertheless incorporating these distinct limits into this Bill.",8,243,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00243
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"This is especially the case since insofar as financial markets are concerned, they view the consolidated Government balance sheet as a whole, as they should. Indeed, SINGA bonds do not appear to have affected the Singapore Government's overall credit rating, which is yet another economic reason to not hive off such limits for the instrument.",9,244,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00244
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Concomitantly, it is also important to calibrate the frequency with which this limit is modified. While fiscal rules such as a reasonable debt limit have been used in many countries and can play an important role in ensuring the sustainability of fiscal affairs, a debt ceiling that is too frequently binding can wreak havoc on the efficient operation of government, as the experience of the United States, where bipartisan brinksmanship routinely plagues efforts to raise the debt ceiling, reminds us.",10,245,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00245
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"To this effect, may I inquire whether this Government has considered whether this limit is appropriate? What is the premise or justification behind the current debt limit ceiling amount of $1.065 trillion? Is there a body that routinely examines the veracity of this debt limit and how frequently should we expect to change this?",11,246,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00246
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The second point, Mr Speaker, I wish to raise has to do with how clause 20 of the Bill restricts the ability of other Government entities, in particular, MAS from accepting advance deposits in anticipation of raising loans by way of Treasury Bills.",12,247,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00247
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While this may be a sound principle in practice, history is rife with examples of central banks that have gone ahead and monetised debt on behalf of a profligate sovereign, breeding inflation as a result.",13,248,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00248
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),It is worth noting that two recent developments may yet necessitate additional flexibility for the monetary authority to act in an anticipatory manner.,14,249,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00249
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The first such circumstance, as Members of this House would be aware of, has to do with the zero lower bound faced by nominal interest rates. Although Singapore has never quite faced this problem in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 and the MAS, unlike most central banks, targets the nominal exchange rate rather than the policy interest rate, it is nevertheless worth keeping in mind that one prescription to the problem of the zero lower bound is to allow for central banks to intervene directly in short-term money markets by issuing securities on their own account.",15,250,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00250
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),The second situation is to do with the emerging central bank digital currency landscape (CBDC). Such CBDCs are likely to become a permanent part of the future of central banking worldwide and I understand that MAS is on the forefront of this and even commissioned the sandbox for studying the usage of such currencies.,16,251,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00251
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While the detailed findings of this exercise have yet to be made public, it is reasonable to ask if the practical implementation of CBDCs may yet require flexibility for MAS to be able to accept such advance deposits for Treasury Bills and if this Bill would preclude such action.",17,252,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00252
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Hence, while I accept that these two conditions are somewhat unusual, it is nevertheless worth asking if this particular clause in the Bill may unnecessarily tie the hands of the MAS to operate in a modern global macroeconomic environment.",18,253,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00253
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Finally, clause 24 of the Bill explicitly states that the authority may, ""refuse any application to take up Government securities or Treasury Bills issued without assigning any reason.""",19,254,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00254
2021-11-03-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While I accept the prerogative of the Government to reserve the right to refuse the sale of his debt to any given entity, it is also surely reasonable, at least, for Singaporean purchases to be provided some form of explanation for why they are unable to purchase the debt of their own Government.",20,255,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00255

2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have two points of clarification to make.,2,259,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00259
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is on the merging of limits under the Government Securities Act and the Local Treasury Bills Act. The new section 11 of the Act will replace the separate borrowing limits for Government securities and Treasury Bills with a single borrowing limit.,3,260,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00260
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My concern is that we currently have a much higher borrowing limit for Government securities than for Treasury Bills – more than nine times as much. The Government had its rationale for maintaining this disparity.,4,261,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00261
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"As such, I have three related questions",5,262,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00262
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One, what was the initial intent of having a much higher borrowing limit for Government Securities and Treasury Bills? Does the Ministry see this initial intent as no longer relevant, given that this intent is no longer reflected in the combined borrowing limit?",6,263,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00263
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Two, will this combined limit now result in a greater reliance on Treasury Bills compared to Government securities?",7,264,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00264
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Three, will the Government internally maintain a separate borrowing limit for Government Securities and Treasury Bills?",8,265,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00265
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is on the approval required for borrowing beyond the $1.065 trillion limit.,9,266,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00266
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Both the existing section 11 and the new section 11 allows the Government to borrow beyond its limit as long as there is a Parliamentary resolution and presidential concurrence. I would like to seek some clarification on the approval process.,10,267,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00267
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In both cases, all the Government needs is for the Parliament to pass a resolution by simple majority and for the President to concur. The $1.065 trillion limit appears to make no difference.",11,268,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00268
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Is the borrowing limit merely meant to signal the Government's stance on maximum borrowing? Relatedly, will the Ministry consider introducing a strengthened check-and-balance for when the Government seeks to increase its borrowing limit or to borrow beyond the existing limit?",12,269,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00269
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"For example, we could require such activities to require a two-third vote of approval by the Parliament in addition to the President's concurrence. This process change would reflect the sanctity of the borrowing limit and the severity of increasing or bypassing it.",13,270,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00270
2021-11-03-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",14,271,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00271

2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Members of the House who have shared their views on this Bill.",1,273,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00273
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me first reiterate that this is largely an administrative exercise. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa said, it is housekeeping. There is no change to the substance of our borrowing legislation, the overall borrowing limit and the safeguards to raising the current limit. But let me clarify some of the questions and points that Members have raised.",2,274,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00274
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the outstanding amount of securities under the Local Treasury Bills Act (LTBA) and the Government Securities Act (GSA).,3,275,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00275
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As at 30 September, we have $65 billion under the LTBA and $699 billion under the GSA.",4,276,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00276
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Both Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Louis Ng also asked about the rationale for merging the LTBA and GSA borrowing limits. Let me explain.,5,277,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00277
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, with the introduction of SINGA, we thought that it would be timely to consolidate legislation of Government borrowings for non-spending purposes so as to distinguish these from borrowing for spending purposes under SINGA. By pooling the LTBA and the GSA together under the renamed GSA, this will emphasise that the borrowings issued under this Act are entirely for non-spending purposes.",6,278,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00278
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This would also address what Assoc Prof Jamus Lim was saying. He had suggested to pool it together as one combined limit, together with SINGA. But from the Government's point of view, for better governance and for better control of processes, we want to distinguish between borrowing for non-spending, which is done under LTBA and GSA, and borrowing under SINGA, which is borrowing for infrastructure, which we spend. I think it is prudent and advisable to have different limits for both.",7,279,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00279
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Between GSA and LTBA, both are borrowing for non-spending reasons – one for short-term securities, another for longer-term securities. And we felt that there is no need to distinguish so much between the two. Furthermore, over time, the processes for treatment of LTBA and Treasury Bills and Government securities have become harmonised over the years. Therefore, we see scope for pooling them together.",8,280,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00280
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, a combined limit under this renamed GSA will also provide MAS greater flexibility to calibrate the issuances and tenors of debt issuances based on market conditions. In fact, other countries such as the US and Germany similarly manage their short and long-tenor securities under a single limit.",9,281,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00281
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With this combined borrowing limit, we do not expect the proportion of short- and long-term securities under the renamed GSA to be significantly different from today. This is because a large proportion will continue to be used to issue Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS), which is mainly driven by CPF balances and its investment needs. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa has correctly highlighted, the amount of SSGS issuances is expected to increase over time due to growth in our resident labour force and wages.",10,282,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00282
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The remaining borrowing limit will mostly be utilised by the issuance of Treasury Bills and Singapore Government Securities (SGS) to support market development and it is market demand and conditions that will influence the amount and the tenor of such debt to be issued.,11,283,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00283
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In particular, MAS will calibrate the amount and tenor of such issuances to meet the regulatory needs of financial institutions for high quality liquid assets and to establish a robust sovereign yield curve to support the development of the Singapore dollar corporate bond market. Indeed, it will not be in the Government's interest to issue debt of certain tenors beyond what the market can reasonably absorb as it would skew the interest rate curve used to price Singapore dollar denominated financial instruments and result in capital misallocations.",12,284,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00284
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, to reiterate again, we are combining all the borrowings that are for non-spending purposes – CPF, market development – pooling them together under this renamed GSA.",13,285,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00285
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We believe it is prudent and, from a financial point of view, provides better control – to have this differentiated from borrowing for SINGA projects, which is borrowing which will be used for financing of actual projects. That will be governed separately under SINGA and with a separate limit.",14,286,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00286
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On Mr Liang Eng Hwa's suggestion for a separate borrowing limit for SSGS, I think he highlighted the need to provide clarity to market participants and analysts.",15,287,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00287
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Here, we do not believe there is a need for a separate limit – to carve out SSGS – because if the purpose is to provide clarity and transparency, indeed, the composition of borrowing, be it SSGS, SGS or Treasury Bills, this will be published and will be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. MAS will continue to publish monthly the breakdown of outstanding SGS and Treasury Bills that are issued.",16,288,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00288
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, Mr Louis Ng asked about the purpose of this borrowing limit and if the governance over increases in borrowing limits could be further strengthened to reflect the sanctity of the borrowing limit and the severity of increasing or bypassing it. I think Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also alluded to this in his response.",17,289,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00289
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me clarify. There is really nothing sacrosanct about the borrowing limits. These are not permanent hard caps. In fact, the Government reviews the borrowing limits periodically and we will come back to the Parliament to raise the limits through Parliamentary resolutions where required. The most recent was in January this year.",18,290,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00290
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, as demand for SSGS grows due to rising CPF balances, then, we will start to reach the limit. Likewise, demand for SGS and Treasury Bills will change, depending on regulatory and investment needs and market conditions.",19,291,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00291
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"What is important to understand is that the key safeguard, the key legislative safeguard in the Government Securities Act is that none of these borrowings can be spent. Like I said, it is differentiated from SINGA borrowings. Under the GSA, all of the borrowing proceeds are invested. Therefore, such borrowings do not lead to additional debt burdens.",20,292,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00292
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Given that we already such a legislative safeguard under the GSA, some may ask why then is there still a need for a borrowing limit?",21,293,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00293
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Our view is that this borrowing limit, while it is not a permanent hard cap, serve as an additional layer of checks and safeguards. It is useful for monitoring and each time we get close to the limit and we need to raise the limit, the Government would then have to come back to Parliament and get the agreement to raise this through Parliamentary resolution. Thereafter, the President will act independently in her discretion to concur with this resolution.",22,294,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00294
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With the merger of the LTBA into the GSA, there will not be any change to the existing safeguards and processes that we have in place today.",23,295,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00295
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also asked about two clauses of the Bill, clause 20 on the acceptance of advance deposits by MAS and whether this unnecessarily ties the hands of MAS. We do not believe so. Clause 20 does not hinder us from effective monetary policy at all today. Clause 24 on the reserving the right to refuse a sale of debt to any entities, yes, that is in place in legislation. But should such a scenario were to arise, the Government will make clear its reasons for refusal.",24,296,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00296
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But in any case, we will continue to review and update all aspects of legislations and should there be new developments in the marketplace or new requirements, we will periodically update legislation where necessary.",25,297,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00297
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In summary, Sir, this Bill seeks to provide clarity on the Government’s debt profile, and reflect that the majority of the Government borrowings will continue to be issued under the renamed GSA for non-spending purposes.",26,298,2021-11-03-T-016-S-00298
2021-11-03-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I assure Members of this House that our fiscal position remains strong with borrowings.

LSOs in the Legal Branch, such as in the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and in the various Ministries, support effective and nimble functioning of the Executive and Parliament. For example, officers in AGC's Legislative Division, not only draft all the laws that are tabled and debated in this House, and I am sure Members are very familiar with all the Bills that have come, sometimes at breakneck speed, but also many pieces of subsidiary legislation that are critical for the effective functioning of the Executive.",19,328,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00328

2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The first part, career in the Courts. In relation to clause 26 of the Bill, which is the transitional provision, existing officers in the legal service will be allocated or re-deployed according to the posts that they are holding. For example, existing office holders in the Supreme Courts or other subordinate Courts, like the Family Justice Courts, shall come under the newly-formed Judicial Service Commission (JSC). A ""judicial branch officer"" is defined as an existing officer who is holding a post in the Supreme Court or a Subordinate Court. My question is  what would be the definition of a ""Subordinate Court"", besides the Family Justice Courts and the State courts, what others can be taken into consideration? For example, such as Tribunals?",11,400,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00400
2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"We are also facing the challenge of a limited talent pool. Recently, three judiciary commissioners have been appointed judges in the Supreme Court. They are either Senior Counsel or senior practitioners taken from the Bar, one of whom I have appeared before, he was my arbitrator, another was an opposing counsel, the third I have worked with. As much as I am glad that we have very talented and esteemed appointments to the judiciary bench, the thinning of the talent at the Bar is a very real risk to our legal profession. We need to ensure that the deep bench in our Courts does not come at the expense of the Bar and deplete our talent pool at the Singapore Bar which is detrimental to our status of our dispute resolution hub.",12,401,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00401
2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, the talent for our judiciary and the Bench must be built up internally as well. I would propose that despite the separate arms being set up with the Legal Service Commission (LSC) and the JSC, that there should still be some flexibility or a fixed rotation between JSC and LSC officers in the early years of their career. This is so that they can get sufficient experience; and also be exposed to experience in the other courts. Hence, I would like to ask whether there would be flexibility to allow for transfers between both commissions to better prepare ourselves for the future needs of the Bench.",13,402,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00402
2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Speaking about the future needs of the Bench, this flows into the second part of my speech on challenges in the future. The future challenges of greater cross-border litigation which not only involve complex legal or factual issues but also inevitably involves issues of conflict of laws and interface between common law and civil law systems in the various legal systems in other countries.",14,403,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00403
2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"New and specialised areas of law, for example, those involving smart contracts and cryptocurrency, would also require our judges to be equipped with the necessary commercial and perhaps, private practice experience and practical know-how. These would greatly complement the technical and legal skills already on the Bench. Ultimately, a strong Bench would help to attract more disputes and bolster our dispute resolution hub status as a nation.",15,404,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00404
2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"We thus need judges who understand practice and commercial realities. Thus, without the risk of thinning of the Bar, perhaps the Ministry could look into the secondment of Judicial Service officers in specific private practice areas or international postings in the early parts of their career. Of course, this is subject to issues of conflict of interest in the future and disclosure of associations in the future, once that officer leaves private practice to rejoin the Judiciary. However, such declarations are already the norm now when judges declare any potential conflict of interest prior to being docketed as a judge for a case.",16,405,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00405
2021-11-03-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Already, we have seen in the courts how a docket system of specialist judges with the relevant practice experience and managing the case from the outset would improve the case management and our cases in litigation have now progressed efficiently and effectively. Perhaps also to complement the skillset, we can have more invited International Judges (IJs) to be part of our Judiciary and not just for cases before the Singapore International Commercial Courts (SICC), but perhaps the IJs, or International Judges, can also sit in specific High Court cases or appeals whenever necessary.",17,406,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00406

I am grateful that MinLaw supports this need to carry out structural changes to the Legal Service.",2,511,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00511
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The Judiciary is one of the three Organs of State. It plays an integral part in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is accessible to all the citizens of Singapore. For that reason, it is important that the Government reviews the structure of the Legal Service to ensure that both judicial officers and Legal Service officers are adequately prepared for the future.",3,512,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00512
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the 2020 Annual Report of the Legal Service Commission, it was reported that there are 806 Legal Service Officers (LSOs) in service as at 31 December 2020. Of these 806 LSOs, 224 were in the judicial branch and 582 in the legal branch. The judicial branch serves the Supreme Court, the State Court and the Family Justice Courts. The legal branch serves the AGC and the legal service departments in various Ministries and Statutory Boards. As an example, the 582 LSOs serve in Government agencies other than AGC, like they serve in ACRA, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), EDB, Health Service Authority (HSA), IMDA, IPOS, IRAS, Office of Public Guardian (OPG), LTA, SLA, NEA, SMC, MUIS and so on. So, it is really a wide scope for these LSOs.",4,513,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00513

Out of these 187,016 cases, 143,728 are classified as criminal cases, 31,189 are classified as civil cases and there are 12,099 community and tribunal-related cases. The caseload for the State Courts for 2019 was higher at 249,954 cases. That is almost a quarter million. The caseload for 2018 was even higher at 359,064 cases.",5,514,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00514
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Then we go on to the Family Justice Courts. The caseload is 25,633 cases for 2020 and 27,953 cases for 2019. If you add the total caseloads of the State Courts, the Family Justice Courts and the work in the Supreme Court, many of us will agree that the 224 judicial officers, even with support staff, will be grossly overstretched.",6,515,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00515
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The Singapore Courts Annual Report also gave examples of significant cases handled by the Courts.

Today, lawyers and judges alike, would have to adjust to this concept of therapeutic justice in family disputes.",9,518,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00518
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Based on the volume of cases handled by the State Courts and Family Justice Courts and the increasing complexity of cases, I would submit that it is timely for us to review the need for our judicial officers to have greater specialisation so as to gain greater depth of knowledge about the latest developments in the law.",10,519,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00519

2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"For that reason, Sir, I submit that we need to invest heavily in our legal officers serving both in the Judiciary as well as in the Legal Service so that we can continue to earn and maintain the trust of the people in our legal system. Having a separate Judicial Service Commission and a Legal Service Commission is just a step towards recognising the challenges facing our LSOs and allow them to explore greater specialisation and more equipped for the future. Having a personnel board for each commission also ensures that we continue to attract and retain talent to serve in the legal and judicial services.",14,523,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00523
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Our judicial officers need more specialised knowledge to better grasp the complex laws and facts; they also need equipping to understand the different emotions of the litigant. And that is not an easy task for Judicial officers. I quote Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice in the UK, in a speech which he made in October 2008. He said, “Many qualities are required of a judge… He or she must, of course, know the law, and know how to apply it, but the judge must always be wise to the ways of the world. The judge must have the ability to make a decision.""",15,524,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00524

2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"""Judges must have moral courage. It is an important judicial attribute to make decisions that will be unpopular with the politicians or the media and the public, and, indeed, perhaps, most importantly of all, to defend the right to equal treatment before the law, of those who are unpopular at any given time.”",17,526,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00526
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, even the person who may be very unpopular or condemned by social media or members of the public, it is the job of a judge to ensure that this person is given the right to equal treatment before the law, even if they are unpopular at any point of time. These are wise words because judicial officers would need to deal firmly with recalcitrant offenders and yet show compassion to an accused person who may have made a mistake due to poor judgement or reacted badly due to a breakdown in emotions. Judicial officers in the Family Justice Courts would have to deal with litigants sensitively, especially where there are young children involved.",18,527,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00527
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, the proposed amendments to the Constitution did not specifically state whether LSOs can still be transferred between the judicial divisions or the legal service division. However, I am glad to hear the Minister's confirmation that cross-service secondments will continue to be available on application where useful, to provide selected officers with cross-service experience.",19,528,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00528
2021-11-03-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I think it is important that legal officers can still be allowed to ask for cross-service postings so as to deepen their knowledge of the work that they do. For example, if a judicial officer in the Family Court wishes to seek a posting to MSF to better understand how family disputes can be resolved, surely that kind of cross-postings should be encouraged. That judicial officer would then be armed with practical life skills that would make him or her a better judge in the Family Justice Courts. Similarly, a legal officer who had served as a prosecutor or a lawyer who had previously worked as a litigation lawyer is better placed to understand the adversarial nature of disputes. I would also submit that all our judicial officers must have some wide exposure to community work and more depth of experience in life before being appointed as judicial officers. Even as we position our legal service and judicial service officers as what former Chief Justice, the late Mr Yong Pung How, described as the “premier service” in the public sector, I hope that we also remind our judicial officers on the need to remain humble as they serve the wider society in Singapore.",20,529,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00529

2021-11-03-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I speak in support of both Bills. These Bills involve the setting up of a Judicial Services Commission in Singapore which will oversee the judicial officers in both the State Courts and the Supreme Court. The Commission’s role includes determining the appointment, confirmation, placement on permanent establishment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of judicial officers. So, essentially, this controls the personnel function.",2,533,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00533
2021-11-03-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"These functions were previously carried out by the Legal Services Commission, which oversaw all legal officers in the Public Service, including both the judicial services, those in the Attorney-General’s Chambers and those in other public agencies. The Legal Services Commission will remain, but its remit will no longer cover judicial officers.",3,534,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00534

2021-11-03-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The rationale for such changes is that it allows specialisation in each of the services and for the senior officers in each branch to properly evaluate and appoint the officers to that branch. This is obviously quite sensible. There is also an argument that this provides a cleaner separation of powers, with judicial officers cleanly separated from those performing other functions, such as in public prosecution. This separation of functions exists in many countries, including many in the Commonwealth.",5,536,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00536
2021-11-03-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Having said that, this matter has been raised before, including in this House, and in the past, we had always believed that having a single Legal Services Commission had worked well for Singapore and had certain advantages. This included that officers could be rotated across functions and to develop broader experiences.",6,537,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00537
2021-11-03-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Judicial officers, for example, could benefit from having had stints as counsel, such as public prosecutors. Similarly, those acting as public prosecutors may also benefit from having spent time as registrars, or even as district judges, as they will see matters from the perspective of the bench. There is also a perception that the judicial service would be the more desired branch and, in the past, those in other parts of the legal service may aspire to be judicial officers if they performed well.",7,538,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00538
2021-11-03-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, while I note that the separation of functions does not prevent cross-posting of officers, and the Minister in his introductory statement has stated secondments will be available, will such cross-postings be more difficult, now that there are different commissions governing both? Is there also a risk that if an officer stays only in one branch of the service, they may not get the broader perspective they used to be able to get in the past that will help them perform their functions better? Does this also mean that legal careers will be set in stone, depending on which side of the branch they start in? Clarifications notwithstanding, I support both Bills.",8,539,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00539

2021-11-03-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On Chairman/PSC's presence on both the JSC and LSC, Mr Louis Ng might be interested to know that, in fact, the 1959 Constitution, which I referred to earlier and which first established the LSC, already provided for the Chairman of PSC to be an ex-officio member of the LSC and that, has since, remained unchanged. So, we are simply using that and Chairman/PSC remains now on both of the two Commissions, post-split.",7,547,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00547
2021-11-03-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, there is a good reason for this. It has allowed the LSC to draw from the best practices, particularly from a human resource perspective, of the PSC, while the Commissions remain separate and independent.

Again, as I have said in my opening speech, this is something that has already been in place since the 1959 Constitution although, prior to 2007, Chairman/PSC could nominate two members of the PSC directly to the LSC, whereas, today, Chairman/PSC advises the President on the appointment of up to two members and the President has the discretion to veto such nominations. That structure remains today in the Bill. In fact, just to be complete, this is on the same footing as the Chief Justice and the Prime Minister.

2021-11-03-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Even if, for the sake of argument, one were to accept that there is some risk that Chairman/PSC would not act independently, this concern is premised on the notion that Chairman/PSC's nominees will somehow be unable to act independently as well.

2021-11-03-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I had earlier mentioned in my speech how both the Judicial and Legal Branches have been taking measures to deepen specialisation within their own skillsets.

2021-11-03-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With the restructuring, the two Commissions will have the flexibility to also develop their own unique value proposition in terms of breadth of exposure for their officers, talent development, opportunities for career progression, recruitment and so on. As I have said earlier, the competition is not just within the Service. It is how do we attract the best talent, given that we have developed the legal industry, the legal landscape in Singapore to an extent where the top talent does exist in Singapore.",33,573,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00573

2021-11-03-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The cases are getting more complex; not just more but also more complicated. But the officers have worked very hard. And just to give Members a sense, between 2018 and 2020, the State Courts and Family Justice Courts collectively dealt with an average caseload of more than 292,000 cases each year. What is also commendable is that, in these three years at least, the State Courts have consistently achieved a total case clearance rate of more than 100% each year, which means that the number of cases they clear exceeds the number of new cases that are filed each year. So, they are progressively clearing a backlog and making sure that cases are disposed of more expeditiously.",36,576,2021-11-03-T-017-S-00576

2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, Singapore is ageing – a fact well emphasised in recent years. One in five Singaporeans will be aged over 65 years old by 2030.

2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"These challenges had been fomenting pre-COVID but the challenging situation ""boiled over"" when the supply of MDWs was curbed by travel restrictions during the pandemic.

2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Families stunned by such requests have little option – they could not just find a replacement easily especially during the pandemic period. Many of such families dare not ask the MDWs to honour the contracts and stay on because their loved ones are literally in the hands of the MDW. Hence, they either offer a higher salary or consent to the transfer. The latter obviously leaves families with real care needs in the lurch. Such phenomenon would also come across as favouring the high earners.",3,650,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00650
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"In some instances where families were reluctant to the transfer requests, allegations of abuse were made to force a transfer. A young working mother of two called ""AK"" in short, shared with me in an email that her helper accused her family of providing insufficient food and rest and demanded a transfer. Thankfully, ""AK"" had CCTV footages to prove that the allegations were untrue.",4,651,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00651
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Several other Singaporeans shared their unpleasant experiences with me via social media and through conversations. Upon receiving complaints of possible abuse, MOM would have to investigate and the process can take months. During this time, the families face challenges hiring replacements. And even if the allegations were eventually found to be baseless, the MDWs often faced no legal consequence and were sent back to their home countries, at worst. Innocent families that had endured the ordeal are then left to pick up the pieces on their own. Many felt helpless.",5,652,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00652
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Again, it must be recognised that there are egregious cases of real abuse and these must be dealt with by the law. But false allegations without real consequences seem unfair too. As such, a number of Singaporean employers wrote to me to express their desire for fairer treatment and called for more help.",6,653,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00653
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"So, how to make it better? The good news now is that the MOM has relaxed the measures to allow vaccinated migrant domestic workers to enter Singapore just a few days ago from 1 November 2021. This mitigates the challenging situation to some extent, but some underlying issues remain to be solved.",7,654,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00654
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"A few suggestions, therefore, for MOM’s consideration.",8,655,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00655
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"First, on improving access for middle-income or ""sandwiched"" families. So, the first one is that it is important to ensure equitable access to hiring MDWs for ordinary Singaporean families with real care needs. Thus, could we consider introducing a higher tier of MDW levy for high-income non-local households to mitigate the imbalance of paying power?",9,656,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00656
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Second, to introduce consequences for errant irresponsible MDWs.",10,657,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00657
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"So, the second one is to ensure completeness of individual MDWs' employment history so that it is usable. A Singaporean employer by the name ""Han"" who hired a MDW to care for her grandparents shared her experiences over email. She showed me screenshots of the MDW's history of several employment but the column for reason of cancellation was entirely blank. She asked how could one objectively assess prospective MDWs? Therefore, could MOM consider requiring employment agencies (EAs) to fill in the reason for cancellation or allow employers to do so directly? Many families also do not know of the existence of such records and it would be very useful if more publicity can be done.",11,658,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00658
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Third, to encourage matching to be taken more seriously, could MOM consider imposing a cap on the number of transfers initiated by the MDW in a year? Exceeding that cap with no valid reason and proof would then require the MDW to return to their home country. Presently, I am aware that employers who repeatedly request for transfers in a short period of time face restrictions in hiring MDWs. So, it would seem fair to ensure all parties involved to take the contract seriously.",12,659,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00659
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Fourth, could there be more stringent checks or restrictions on MDWs with a poor performance record when re-entering Singapore for new jobs?",13,660,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00660
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,Next is on building up responsible EAs.,14,661,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00661
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"So, the fifth recommendation is that I learnt from MOM's response to my Parliamentary Question last month that the Ministry is working to encourage EAs to take greater ownership of matching outcomes. If so, could the MOM consider allowing the matching of MDWs be done by local EAs only, that is, to disallow private bartering via social media platforms which are unregulated? However, I understand that there are concerns about whether this will give EAs too much power and risk high agency fees. Perhaps, MOM could pay more attention to this.",15,662,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00662
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"And lastly, for support for employers.",16,663,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00663
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"The sixth and last recommendation is that many Singaporean families who need MDWs for care needs are crying for greater support. Some are busy trying to make ends meet and some are just not savvy with the systems. Thus, could MOM consider establishing neutral advisory channel or platform offering these families information and consultations?",17,664,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00664
2021-11-03-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"In conclusion, as Singapore continues to enhance our overall care support system, the role of migrant domestic workers in how Singaporean families choose to provide care for their loved ones remain important. In ensuring a successful relationship between the employer family and the MDW will require genuine efforts and mutual respect from both parties. Hence, I hope with the challenges addressed, families will feel more supported and better able to focus on their work and pursue a happier life.",18,665,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00665

2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"By 2050, almost half of Singapore's total population will be at least 65. As such, care support is of utmost concern not just for our elders but for the adult children who bear the responsibility to look after their own children and their aged parents. It has been said in this Chamber that the true costs of caregiving affects certain groups disproportionately.",2,668,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00668
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"During the closing session of the conversations on Singapore women's development, the Prime Minister acknowledged that women often tend to have additional caregiving responsibilities for both young and old and that more can be done to support them emotionally and financially. Dependence on such unpaid family caregivers who are usually women is not longer tenable.",3,669,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00669
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"In the late 1970s, the foreign maid scheme was launched to enable families to employ MDWs and support women's participation in the workplace.",4,670,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00670
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"In May this year, it was announced that all new entry approvals for work pass holders from countries with higher risk of COVID-19 will be temporarily halted, including Indonesia, Philippines and Myanmar, all three of which provide the bulk of Singapore's MDWs. Many of us would have had residents appealed to us to allow MDWs to secure entry approvals to care for both young and old in Singapore. With dual income households now forming more than half of all married couples as of 2020, an MDW is often considered an important of fulfilling caregiving needs for families from various income backgrounds.",5,671,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00671
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Let us take stock briefly. Aside from MDWs, what caregiving solutions are available for seniors? This is my focus today.",6,672,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00672
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"AIC has developed the network of community care services which fall under three broad themes  homecare, daycare and stay-in care. These initiatives are greatly appreciated. However, they can come across as piece-meal with multiple application processes and many adult children rely on an MDW as an all-in-one solution to care for their aged parents. There is almost a quarter of a million MDWs here on work permits as of June 2021. And despite the pandemic, some reports have suggested that the demand for MDWs remains steady, if not, increased, even as costs trended upwards.",7,673,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00673
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),MDWs continue to be important as part of our caregiving landscape for a few key reasons.,8,674,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00674
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"First, seniors have complex needs and applying for different segregated services can be more expensive and inconvenient. Round trips for medical transport services are between $62 and $90 before subsidies, which can be unaffordable for some. In Cheng San-Seletar, I am very grateful for community befrienders who often step in to accompany seniors, who are fall risks to their hospital appointments.",9,675,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00675
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"On the other hand, home personal care costs cost approximately $20 per hour prior to means test subsidies and referrals from hospitals or polyclinics are often required. With higher collective costs and sometimes incomplete combinations of services, hiring an MDW is often a coherent solution.",10,676,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00676
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, our seniors tend to price independence and have preferences against institutionalised care. The perceived loss of independence in a nursing home is something they are concerned about and so children hire MDW as this support is compatible with their filial duty to meet their parents' desires to age-in-place without compromising on safety.",11,677,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00677
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"One possible solution is the model recently announced by HDB, MOH and MND  the Community Care Apartments to encourage independent living. And I am very much looking forward to see how care can be better aggregated so our seniors live with dignity in their golden years.",12,678,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00678
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Lastly, prior to the pandemic, families often turned to MDWs as a more timely solution due to unfamiliarity with existing schemes and the limited time in finding suitable caregiving options. Some have also raised concerns about the waiting list for subsidised elder sitting services and nursing homes and looking for suitable step-down care services causes stress for families. Many also find it risky to wait and see if their loved ones qualify for a subsidised space or not.",13,679,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00679
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, MDWs will likely continue to be part of our caregiving landscape. Closer attention should be paid to the matching and training of our MDWs. There are stories of MDWs experiencing burnout when expectations of their jobs are mismatched with the tasks required.",14,680,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00680
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"A study conducted by AWARE and HOME shared this sentiment, pointing to the lack of information provided by employers and verification by employment agencies. We could look at establishing a more thorough needs assessment, which can be verified by employment agencies through submitted health records. Should that be a mismatch of skills and job requirements, employers can then apply for the caregivers' training grant to upskill the MDW.",15,681,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00681
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Another proposal would be expanding the homecare giving grant (HCG). Currently, the grant provides a $200 monthly payout to families supporting their loved ones with permanent moderate disability. Qualifying for the grant requires means testing and assessment of the care recipient's ability to carry out activities of daily living or ADL. These measures ensure that the ones with the most needs receive the grant but it leaves a gap where vulnerable groups can fall into. For instance, a dual income couple with an elderly mother and two young children may find themselves needing an MDW but they may fail to qualify for the HCG because their elderly mother only requires assistance to perform two ADLs, despite having other chronic health issues. Even though hiring an MDW may be the least expensive option, this sandwiched class of families will be paying the full price.",16,682,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00682
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"We could explore a points-based system where the number of ADLs that require assistance in household per capita, a monthly income can be tiered. A combination of these scores can provide a fuller picture for families in greater financial need versus separating the financial and functional criteria.",17,683,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00683
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, we can also explore compensating part-time family caregivers better under the grant. In Hawaii, for example, their Kupuna Caregivers Assistance Act provides a daily stipend to a caregiver who is also working 30 hours a week. This approach allows caregivers to continue working in some capacity, or dial back at work while assuming caregiving responsibilities.",18,684,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00684
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"In closing, I wish to acknowledge and highlight the challenges faced by many Singaporeans during this pandemic in employing MDWs to support caregiving needs. Some have described being at their wits end, finishing up annual leave to race to their loved ones’ side. One resident shared that while waiting for the entry approval of an MDW to be approved, she would take turns to care for her elderly mother who was a fall risk, with her brother. Both siblings lived separately from their mother.",19,685,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00685
2021-11-03-T-020,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank AIC who had seen her to discuss care options, but none were suitable as her mother had an illness which prevented her from going into a care home and in any event strongly did not want to do so, prizing independence. The daughter felt a deep sense of filial piety and did not insist. However, when her brother and his family was on Quarantine Order, the 14 days back then which ensued were a nightmare for her as she struggled to balance work and caregiving, and even thought about quitting her job.",20,686,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00686

Ultimately, for MDWs to continue to be part of the caregiving landscape, we strive to build a system that is fair to both the MDW employers and the MDWs.",29,717,2021-11-03-T-020-S-00717

2021-11-03-T-024,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The Singapore Government is mindful of the challenges faced by overseas Singaporeans, including our students based overseas, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been urging all Singaporeans to get vaccinated. Those who are leaving for overseas studies this year would have had the opportunity to be vaccinated in Singapore before they depart. We understand that some Singaporeans prefer to or may find it difficult to return to Singapore to be vaccinated. We have therefore launched two dedicated vaccination channels recently to make it more convenient for overseas Singaporeans, including our Singaporean students studying abroad, to return to Singapore for vaccination while minimising the time they are required to spend in SHN. As of 31 October 2021, we have received close to 250 successful sign-ups from overseas Singaporeans.",2,736,2021-11-03-T-024-S-00736

Our Overseas Missions have provided support and guidance to students who have contracted COVID-19 abroad or had to self-isolate due to being close contacts or from travelling. Such support includes keeping their next-of-kin in Singapore updated of their situation, and connecting the affected individuals with relevant student support groups for the provision of meals and medical supplies.",3,737,2021-11-03-T-024-S-00737

In view of the pandemic, Missions and the Singapore Global Network have increasingly leveraged social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Whatsapp, as well as local social media platforms like Weibo, to address students’ COVID-19 concerns, including their queries related to travel and border measures. MFA will continue to prioritise such regular engagement and the provision of timely consular assistance and advice to Singaporean students abroad, to ensure their safety and well-being.

2021-11-03-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Smoking in one’s flat may cause nuisance and health concerns to neighbours if cigarette smoke wafts into their homes. While this is covered by the covenant referred to by the Member, enforcing the breach of a covenant under the lease entails compulsory acquisition of the flat. This is a harsh measure that is not undertaken lightly. HDB exercises the right of compulsory acquisition sparingly and often as a last resort. Moreover, should a flat be compulsorily acquired, the flat owners and occupants of the flat, such as their family members, will need to relocate and find a home elsewhere. If the underlying issues are not resolved, the issue will just be brought over to another community.",1,740,2021-11-03-T-025-S-00740
2021-11-03-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Hence, the approach to manage disamenities and disputes between neighbours is for neighbours to come together to try to resolve the matter amicably. When residents provide feedback to agencies on second-hand tobacco smoke issues, HDB, together with Town Councils and the National Environment Agency, will first encourage neighbours to speak to each other to try to resolve the matter. Where necessary, a Joint Advisory on Smoking in Homes will be issued to the residential unit reported to be emitting second-hand smoke, encouraging considerate behaviour and emphasising the negative impact that second-hand smoke may have on their neighbours.",2,741,2021-11-03-T-025-S-00741
2021-11-03-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If this does not work, the agencies will advise the affected neighbour to seek mediation. In intractable cases, the affected neighbour may file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT). If the respondent is shown to have caused unreasonable interference to the affected neighbour, then the CDRT may make a range of orders against the respondent, including requiring the respondent to cease or refrain from carrying out certain acts.",3,742,2021-11-03-T-025-S-00742

ComCare beneficiaries receive comprehensive support that includes cash assistance to help the family meet the income shortfall for their daily living expenses on basic needs, such as food, transport, and communications. Depending on the household’s needs, they may also receive free medical treatment at public healthcare institutions and be referred to relevant government agencies or our community partners for further support.",3,755,2021-11-03-T-028-S-00755
2021-11-03-T-028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, the ComCare cash assistance provided does not cover loans or instalment payments, which will vary depending on the household’s financial decisions and use of credit. Such payments also generally contribute towards the building of personal assets, which would not be appropriate for the Government to fund via public resources. Our social assistance schemes therefore prioritise support for daily living expenses instead.",4,756,2021-11-03-T-028-S-00756

For instance, we will refer families with debts to relevant debt advisory services like Credit Counselling Singapore, where personal financial counsellors will guide them on the possible courses of action to manage and reduce their debts. Depending on their circumstances, the families may also receive further assistance to negotiate and/or restructure unsecured loans, so that they can make monthly repayments at reduced interest rates which they can afford. The families will also have access to financial literacy classes to equip themselves with financial planning skills such as budgeting, and support groups where they can seek peer advice.",5,757,2021-11-03-T-028-S-00757

2021-11-03-T-034,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Most of the recommendations in the advisory can be adopted at little to no cost. For example, companies are already required to undertake risk assessment. The advisory advises them to incorporate mental well-being in these regular risk assessments. iWorkHealth is an online, self-administered psychosocial health assessment tool to identify common workplace stressors. It is provided free. Other recommendations such as encouraging more open and regular conversations on mental well-being and form informal support networks amongst employees likewise do not cost much to the company, but still giving due attention to employees’ mental well-being in the workplace.",2,783,2021-11-03-T-034-S-00783

The measures to reduce the risk of transmissions and reinfections in dormitories are similar. First, over 97% of migrant workers, including recovered workers residing in dormitories have been fully vaccinated. Next, we have a multi-layered strategy to contain the spread of COVID-19 within dormitories. This includes implementing Safe Living Measures and infection prevention and control practices to limit transmission in the dormitories, Rostered Routine Testing, and testing workers with acute respiratory illness symptoms to detect outbreaks early.

2021-11-03-T-050,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"As ICIJ itself is careful to acknowledge, there are legitimate reasons to set up offshore structures, such as for investment and estate management. However, offshore structures often lack transparency and are thus vulnerable to abuse for illicit activities. Hence, MAS has clear requirements for FIs in Singapore to identify and verify the identities of persons who are beneficial owners or effective controllers of their customer accounts. FIs must understand the reasons for the use of such structures, take measures to ascertain that the assets held in these structures are not illicit, and scrutinise any unusual transactions as part of their ongoing monitoring of the account.",9,852,2021-11-03-T-050-S-00852
2021-11-03-T-050,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS also supervises the FIs to ensure that their boards and management have implemented robust controls against money laundering and terrorism financing. Where there are breaches of AML/CFT requirements, MAS has taken strong enforcement action.",10,853,2021-11-03-T-050-S-00853
2021-11-03-T-050,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"In fact, both the licensed trust companies in Singapore mentioned in the Pandora Papers have already been subject to MAS’ supervisory or enforcement actions. One of them, Asiaciti Trust (Singapore) Pte Ltd, paid a composition penalty of $1.1 million imposed by MAS in July last year for its failure to implement adequate AML/CFT policies and procedures. The other trust company, Trident Trust Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was directed by MAS in September last year to remediate weaknesses detected in its risk assessment controls during MAS’ supervisory surveillance. Both companies were under intensified scrutiny by MAS before they were mentioned in the Pandora Papers.",11,854,2021-11-03-T-050-S-00854
2021-11-03-T-050,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Let me assure this House that Singapore takes the integrity of our financial sector very seriously. As a major international financial centre, Singapore will always face the risk of illicit financial flows. What is important is that we supervise our FIs well, and take strong enforcement actions where necessary to reduce this risk as much as possible. MAS has been doing this and will continue to do so.",12,855,2021-11-03-T-050-S-00855
2021-11-03-T-051,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Home Affairs with the increase in deployment of surveillance technologies for crime prevention (a) how will the captured data be utilised; (b) how will the data be protected from theft or misuse; (c) whether there are specific physical areas where surveillance technologies will not be deployed to; and (d) how will the Ministry address the concerns of those who feel that their privacy is being invaded.,1,856,2021-11-03-T-051-S-00856
2021-11-03-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police cameras (PolCams) are deployed in public places such as public residential estates, neighbourhood centres, hawker centres, commercial and entertainment districts, to deter and solve crimes. PolCams have helped the Police to solve more than 5,000 crimes since 2012 and surveys show that people feel safer with PolCams in their neighbourhood.",1,857,2021-11-03-T-051-S-00857
2021-11-03-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In the deployment of PolCams, the Police seek to address the broader interests of public safety and security, while respecting the privacy of private spaces. PolCams are therefore deployed at locations which only cover public spaces.",2,858,2021-11-03-T-051-S-00858
2021-11-03-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There are strict data protection safeguards and controls on the access and use of information obtained through PolCams.

Any person found accessing the footage for unauthorised purposes will be severely dealt with.",3,859,2021-11-03-T-051-S-00859
2021-11-03-T-052,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry given the supply chain disruption and increase in energy costs, whether there will be any impact to food prices in the next six months.",1,860,2021-11-03-T-052-S-00860
2021-11-03-T-052,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The cost of food is affected by a combination of factors, including the imported prices, energy costs, freight, labour, and seasonal weather changes. Domestic food prices have risen in the past six months, due mainly to increased prices for global food commodities, higher energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortages.",1,861,2021-11-03-T-052-S-00861
2021-11-03-T-052,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We expect food prices to rise further in the coming months as energy prices, a contributor to the global cost of food, are expected to increase. Suppliers may need to adjust prices to reflect cost increases.",2,862,2021-11-03-T-052-S-00862
2021-11-03-T-052,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To mitigate the impact of higher food prices on families, the Government will continue to assist Singapore families in various ways. For example, MSF’s Social Service Offices (SSOs) provide ComCare assistance to low-income households to support their daily living expenses. The Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme has also helped less well-off Singaporeans with their household expenses during this period of economic uncertainty. Singapore will continue to diversify our import sources to keep prices competitive and enhance supply resilience.",3,863,2021-11-03-T-052-S-00863
2021-11-03-T-053,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in each of the past five years, how many cyclists have been booked for riding on a road on the right side of motor vehicles when not overtaking or not preparing to make a right turn; and (b) whether cyclists are allowed to ride on the lane to the right of a bus lane if there is no intention to overtake a vehicle on the bus lane or making a right turn.",1,864,2021-11-03-T-053-S-00864
2021-11-03-T-053,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I thank the Member for his question. I have addressed them in my reply to Question Nos 9 and 10 for written answer on the Order Paper for 2 November 2021 Parliament Sitting. [,1,865,2021-11-03-T-053-S-00865
2021-11-03-T-054,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Transport in light of the reduced public transport revenues in this COVID-19 pandemic times and rising expenditure costs (a) whether the Government is satisfied with the value of services in return for grants given out in the current model; and (b) whether the Ministry is looking into restructuring our public transport system, possibly exploring the merger of public transport operators to improve coordination and sustainability under current circumstances.",1,866,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00866
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For the rail industry, LTA has been working closely with rail operators since 2011 to enhance rail reliability, which has exceeded our target of one million mean train kilometres between failures (MKBF) since 2019. These efforts have however come at a significant cost, especially as rail operating assets such as the signalling and power systems continue to age. As the fares paid by commuters are insufficient to cover operating costs, public transport operators have been registering losses for their rail operations even pre-COVID.",1,867,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00867
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"However, this is not sustainable. Public transport should be financially sustainable to ensure operators can continue to provide reliable train services to commuters. To support the operators in achieving and sustaining high reliability levels, we implemented an incentive system, termed the Rail Reliability Incentive, from 2020 to 2023. To qualify for the incentive, rail operators are held to a set of targets on operational performance and safety, including a minimum MKBF of 500,000 train kilometres. Operators obtain the full grant quantum if they achieve one million MKBF or better. As a result, we have seen the operators sustain their performance of above one million MKBF since 2019.",2,868,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00868
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For the bus industry, the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) was introduced in 2016 to make bus services more responsive to commuter needs and to inject more competition into the industry. We do not provide targeted grants under BCM, but instead pay operators service fees to operate the bus services at required service levels. We have also introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework to incentivise bus operators to improve the timeliness of bus arrivals. Operators who meet the targets receive incentive payments, while operators who fail to do so will see their fees reduced.",3,869,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00869
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, public transport ridership has fallen, and fare revenues have decreased sharply. Nevertheless, the operators have largely preserved service capacity and headways. In addition, public transport operators have incurred additional costs to put in place enhanced measures to keep commuters safe.",4,870,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00870
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"During this time, we have supported the operators through broad-based measures provided to affected businesses across different sectors, such as the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS). The grants given to the public transport operators have helped to ensure that our commuters, especially essential workers, can continue to travel to their workplaces, and arrive on time and safely.",5,871,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00871
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Any changes to the industry models should be made with long term considerations in mind. We have to balance the value of competition with the benefits of economies of scale through consolidation. For the bus industry, the number of public transport operators has increased from two to four after the introduction of the BCM. The rail industry also now has two operators. The increased competition has spurred operators to improve service standards and submit more competitive tender bids.",6,872,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00872
2021-11-03-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"New travel patterns have emerged amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with flexible working arrangements becoming more common. We will continue to monitor how travel patterns evolve post-pandemic to assess the long-term impact on public transport ridership, and study if any adjustments are required to ensure financial sustainability as our public transport system continues to deliver high service standards.",7,873,2021-11-03-T-054-S-00873
2021-11-03-T-055,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the average licensing cost incurred by a non-hawker food and beverage establishment; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider waiving the costs for licence renewals (excluding liquor licences) for FY 2022 given the significant impact that COVID-19 has had on food and beverage outlets.,1,874,2021-11-03-T-055-S-00874
2021-11-03-T-055,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) licenses Food and Beverage (F&B) establishments including restaurants, coffee shops and food courts. Operators of F&B establishments are required to obtain a food shop licence from SFA, which costs $195 annually. Individual food stall operators obtain a food stall licence from SFA which costs $32 annually.",1,875,2021-11-03-T-055-S-00875
2021-11-03-T-055,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The cost of the licence is therefore insignificant. The Government is committed to supporting F&B establishments during this difficult period through significant support measures, such as the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Foreign Worker Levy rebates, rental waivers and rental reliefs for qualifying owner-occupiers and tenants under the Rental Relief Scheme (RRS).",2,876,2021-11-03-T-055-S-00876
2021-11-03-T-056,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in the past two years, what are the instances that have necessitated sound barriers to be erected at construction sites; and (b) whether the Ministry will require sound barriers if a construction site is within 150 metres from noise-sensitive premises and residential buildings and has faced multiple complaints and breaches of permissible noise levels.",1,877,2021-11-03-T-056-S-00877
2021-11-03-T-056,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The regulations on construction noise under the Environmental Protection and Management Act strike a balance between enabling the development of needed infrastructure and keeping construction noise to a manageable level. The National Environment Agency (NEA) adopts an outcome-based approach by stipulating maximum permissible noise limits, rather than requiring specific measures that may not be suited for every site. This allows contractors to use the most cost-effective methods to meet the regulatory noise limits, including installing perimeter noise barriers. Construction sites closer to residential buildings and noise-sensitive premises would typically require more measures to meet the noise limits.",1,878,2021-11-03-T-056-S-00878
2021-11-03-T-056,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA takes strict enforcement action against contractors found to have exceeded the noise limits, which includes a fine of up to $40,000 per offence.

2021-11-03-T-057,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"With the good results, the release of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has been expanded to more areas within Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok from October 2021. Releases at Tampines and Yishun will continue to be expanded and cover both towns entirely by the first quarter of 2022. Small-scale trials at landed residential estates in Marine Parade have also commenced in October 2021. Releases will be carried out at selected construction sites in Choa Chu Kang and Tampines as part of the strategy to test the technology in different terrains and landscapes. The results of these trials will inform the strategy for its future deployment in Singapore.",3,883,2021-11-03-T-057-S-00883

2021-11-03-T-058,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"School leaders and teachers are mindful of the need for students to have a balanced life even during the pandemic, with adequate time for family bonding, personal interests and rest.

2021-11-03-T-058,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond homework, there are also other sources of stress in students’ lives during the pandemic. By keeping schools open as far as possible, and ensuring that learning can still continue under Home-Based Learning (HBL) conditions, we provided students with a sense of normalcy and sustained social connections, which have been helpful to easing their anxieties.",3,887,2021-11-03-T-058-S-00887
2021-11-03-T-058,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"When students return to school from extended HBL, the emphasis in schools is on checking on their well-being and curriculum recovery, and not on rushing to complete the syllabus or prepare for assessment. That is why we have cancelled the Primary 3 and Primary 4 year-end examinations and removed the Common Last Topics from national examinations.

2021-11-03-T-059,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Most incidences of bullying can be resolved through an educational and restorative approach. For students involved, their teachers help them learn from the incident, mend relationships and prevent further bullying. The goal is to address the underlying cause of the behaviour, and to change it.

2021-11-03-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Promotion Board (HPB) and healthcare clusters have put in place a variety of programmes to support seniors to stay active and prevent or delay functional decline. The Healthy Ageing Promotion Programme For You (HAPPY) programme is one such example. Since April 2019, the programme has been progressively rolled out at new sites islandwide, including the Eldercare Centres (ECs). It is now available at more than 110 locations. COVID-19 has disrupted the pace of roll out, but we plan to continue the scale-up to new sites as senior activities are able to gradually resume.",1,912,2021-11-03-T-065-S-00912
2021-11-03-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Within the community, primary care providers, healthcare clusters and community care providers are already working together to ensure that seniors receive the care they need. For example, the ECs link up seniors to care and social support services and ensure their medical issues are addressed and care provided is holistic and appropriate. Some of these sites are also supported by community nursing teams from the healthcare clusters. The community nurses provide a range of services such as health screening and coaching, falls and frailty assessment, chronic disease monitoring and caregivers’ education and training. They also refer the seniors to their regular primary care doctor if a medical consultation is needed and refer frail and pre-frail seniors for appropriate physical activity programmes based on their assessed needs and conditions.",2,913,2021-11-03-T-065-S-00913

2021-11-03-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have always taken a holistic view towards urban planning, to provide a liveable and quality environment for all to live, work, and play in. This includes planning and designing a city that keeps its residents safe from various threats, including health-related ones. Beyond our immediate responses to managing the impact of COVID-19, we are also continually studying and reviewing the design of our environment and buildings to future-proof our city against public health threats, including pandemics.",1,923,2021-11-03-T-068-S-00923
2021-11-03-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While many of these studies are ongoing, current findings indicate the importance of adequate ventilation to mitigate airborne disease transmission risk. To this end, BCA already requires new developments and existing developments undergoing major addition and alteration works to be designed for adequate ventilation. For example, all naturally ventilated spaces are required to have a minimum area of openings (e.g. windows) to facilitate air flow. For air-conditioned spaces, buildings are required to take in outdoor air at a minimum rate specified in the Singapore Standard for air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) in buildings. In May 2020 and May 2021, taking into consideration lessons from COVID-19, BCA, NEA, and MOH issued guidelines for building managers to further improve ventilation and indoor air quality.",2,924,2021-11-03-T-068-S-00924
2021-11-03-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As another example, MOM, MND and MOH recently developed improved standards for new migrant worker dormitories to strengthen their resilience against future pandemics and enhance liveability. With these improved standards, dormitory rooms and toilets will have improved ventilation to reduce virus accumulation. For instance, new dormitories will need to include one exhaust fan per toilet and an adequate number of fans in dormitory rooms to ensure sufficient air circulation. The improved standards will also reduce intermixing amongst dormitory residents by modularising dormitory living and segmenting communal facilities.",3,925,2021-11-03-T-068-S-00925
2021-11-03-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Government will continue to study how to improve the planning and design of our environment to better mitigate against future pandemics.,4,926,2021-11-03-T-068-S-00926

The Town Centre is complemented by neighbourhood centres that are distributed across the town. In selected precincts located further away from the Town Centre and neighbourhood centres, HDB will also build precinct shops which generally include an eating house, supermarket or minimart, and a few shops for the convenience of residents. Most residents will be able to access commercial facilities with a food court or eating house within 400 metres from their homes, or a walk of five to 10 minutes. The quantum of HDB commercial space provided depends on the number of dwelling units and the availability of similar facilities nearby.",2,933,2021-11-03-T-070-S-00933
