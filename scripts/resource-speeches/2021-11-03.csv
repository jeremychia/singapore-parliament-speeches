2021-11-03-T-001-S-00001,2021-11-03-T-001,1,Speaker,"Order. I wish to inform hon Members that pursuant to Standing Order No 100(7)(a)(ii), I have on 2 November 2021 nominated Mr Edwin Tong and Ms Rahayu Mahzam to the Committee of Privileges, to take the place of Mr K Shanmugam and Ms Indranee Rajah, on the matter of a complaint made against the Member of Sengkang GRC, Ms Raeesah Khan."
2021-11-03-T-001-S-00002,2021-11-03-T-001,2,Speaker,Mr Edwin Tong and Ms Rahayu Mahzam will serve as Members of the Committee until the Committee has reported upon the matter referred to it.
2021-11-03-T-001-S-00003,2021-11-03-T-001,3,Speaker,Order. Questions for Oral Answer.
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00004,2021-11-03-T-002,4,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Prime Minister in light of the disclosures in the Pandora Papers (a) whether MAS will be looking into the Singapore-based financial institutions and Singaporeans/foreigners who are implicated in the report; (b) whether any individual or financial institution will be asked to issue a clarification as to their activities disclosed in the report; and (c) how does MAS ensure that offshore wealth management services in Singapore remain lawful and legitimate by international standards.
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00005,2021-11-03-T-002,5,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether Singapore is implicated in the Pandora Papers; and (b) whether the Government is investigating whether Singapore entities or individuals residing in Singapore are involved in the alleged practices.
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00006,2021-11-03-T-002,6,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to answer all the Parliamentary Questions (PQs) related to the recent disclosure by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) of confidential information, dubbed the “Pandora Papers” together. This includes Question Nos 1 and 2 from Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Patrick Tay filed for today’s Sitting, the Written PQ from Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling filed for today’s Sitting, and the Oral PQ from Mr Murali Pillai filed for yesterday’s Sitting."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00007,2021-11-03-T-002,7,Speaker,Please do.
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00008,2021-11-03-T-002,8,Lawrence Wong,"Sir, as a global financial centre, Singapore intermediates a large volume of fund flows for investment or commercial purposes and also provides services in financial asset management. While the vast majority of these activities are carried out by law-abiding individuals and companies, we are constantly on guard against the risk of illicit financing activities."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00009,2021-11-03-T-002,9,Lawrence Wong,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) continually monitors and analyses information from a wide range of sources as part of its surveillance of money laundering and terrorism financing risks. This includes suspicious transactions reports filed by our financial institutions (FIs), information from intelligence sources, including those abroad and publicly available information such as from independent investigations and media reports. MAS therefore takes seriously the recent disclosures in the Pandora Papers."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00010,2021-11-03-T-002,10,Lawrence Wong,"The ICIJ has reported that 336 prominent individuals from around the world had established offshore structures to hold assets, assisted by 14 service providers operating in at least 38 jurisdictions. Two of the 14 service providers are foreign-incorporated trust companies with subsidiaries in Singapore that are licensed and regulated by MAS. Some ICIJ media reports also mentioned that many of these individuals had foreign bank accounts linked to these structures, in various financial centres including Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00011,2021-11-03-T-002,11,Lawrence Wong,"Based on MAS’ assessment and information available thus far, the Pandora Papers have not raised significant concerns over the money laundering and counter terrorism financing (AML/CFT) controls of our FIs. Nevertheless, MAS is engaging the relevant FIs to assess if tightening of controls are warranted."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00012,2021-11-03-T-002,12,Lawrence Wong,"As ICIJ itself is careful to acknowledge, there are legitimate reasons to set up offshore structures, such as for investment and estate management. However, offshore structures often lack transparency and are thus vulnerable to abuse for illicit activities. Hence, MAS has clear requirements for FIs in Singapore to identify and verify the identities of persons who are beneficial owners or effective controllers of their customer accounts. FIs must understand the reasons for the use of such structures, take measures to ascertain that the assets held in these structures are not illicit and scrutinise any unusual transactions as part of their ongoing monitoring of the account."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00013,2021-11-03-T-002,13,Lawrence Wong,"MAS also supervises the FIs to ensure that their boards and management have implemented robust controls against money laundering and terrorism financing. Where there are breaches of AML/CFT requirements, MAS has taken strong enforcement action."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00014,2021-11-03-T-002,14,Lawrence Wong,"In fact, both the licensed trust companies in Singapore mentioned in the Pandora Papers have already been subject to MAS’ supervisory or enforcement actions. One of them, Asiaciti Trust (Singapore) Pte Ltd, paid a composition penalty of $1.1 million imposed by MAS in July last year for its failure to implement adequate AML/CFT policies and procedures. The other trust company, Trident Trust Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was directed by MAS in September last year to remediate weaknesses detected in its risk assessment controls during MAS’ supervisory surveillance. Both companies were under intensified scrutiny by MAS before they were mentioned in the Pandora Papers."
2021-11-03-T-002-S-00015,2021-11-03-T-002,15,Lawrence Wong,"Let me assure this House that Singapore takes the integrity of our financial sector very seriously. As a major international financial centre, Singapore will always face the risk of illicit financial flows. What is important is that we supervise our FIs well, and take strong enforcement actions where necessary to reduce this risk as much as possible. MAS has been doing this and will continue to do so."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00016,2021-11-03-T-003,16,Yeo Wan Ling,"asked the Minister for Transport in light of the new COVID-19 protocols where patients waiting for their polymerase chain reaction test results should return home via private transport, what are the measures taken to protect our point-to-point drivers when they are ferrying such passengers."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00017,2021-11-03-T-003,17,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are adequate taxis and private transport to ferry passengers to and return from Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinics; (b) whether the drivers are sufficiently protected; and (c) whether the vehicles are kept sanitised and safe.
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00018,2021-11-03-T-003,18,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 3 and 4 together?"
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00019,2021-11-03-T-003,19,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00020,2021-11-03-T-003,20,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you. Persons who feel unwell and are travelling to and from their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test venue are required to commute via private transport, which includes taxis or private hire cars (PHCs). As these persons are taking regular taxis or PHCs, there is an adequate supply to meet their needs."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00021,2021-11-03-T-003,21,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These passengers should inform their taxi and PHC drivers about their health status so that the drivers may take appropriate precautions. Drivers have been advised to switch off the air-con when ferrying these passengers, wind down their windows during and after each trip, and clean their vehicles after the trips. Passengers should also sit at the back, diagonally from the drivers."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00022,2021-11-03-T-003,22,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"MOH has assessed that these measures are sufficient to minimise the risk of in-vehicle transmission of the virus and there is no need for extra precautionary measures, such as having drivers put on full personal protective equipment. Furthermore, about 98% of our taxi and PHC drivers are fully vaccinated."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00023,2021-11-03-T-003,23,Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00024,2021-11-03-T-003,24,Yeo Wan Ling,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive and very empathetic answer. Our P2P drivers have been very supportive of our journey to the endemic phase and appreciates the Government's continued support of this industry during this period. Given that our P2P drivers will be ferrying more patients and passengers who are exposed to the virus, would the Government be putting in measures to have the taxis and platform companies put in clearer safety SOPs or protocols for drivers and their vehicles? And should our P2P drivers have to self-isolate, will there be additional support for them, given that they would have difficulties with the daily rentals of their vehicles during this isolation period?"
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00025,2021-11-03-T-003,25,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. We note the concerns of the drivers. We have received the feedback from the drivers, the associations and NTUC about ferrying unwell or Ag+ passengers."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00026,2021-11-03-T-003,26,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have worked with MOH who will remind the passengers to declare their health status to the drivers so that the drivers can take the necessary precautions to further minimise the risks of in-vehicle transmission of the virus. MOH has put this information up on their website in their FAQs on Health Protocols. So, this is already up. LTA will be putting it up on our website. LTA is also working with the operators and the associations to publicise this message to the drivers as well as the passengers."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00027,2021-11-03-T-003,27,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, for instance, sending emails to the database of passengers to remind them to declare their health status so that the drivers can take action and also to remind the drivers of the additional precautions that they can take. We are also working with the operators to see if we can craft a message that can be printed out and the drivers can opt to display it in their vehicles to remind the passengers. This is what we are doing to give assurance to the drivers."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00028,2021-11-03-T-003,28,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to support for the drivers, the operators have various measures to provide support to the drivers who either are tested positive for COVID-19 and cannot drive or they are required to self-isolate and therefore, cannot drive. All the taxi operators provide rental waivers for the drivers who cannot drive due to COVID-19 or if they have to self-isolate. The two biggest PHC operators – Grab and Gojek – provide prolonged medical leave insurance coverage for the drivers. This involves financial payouts if the drivers are not able to drive for these reasons."
2021-11-03-T-003-S-00029,2021-11-03-T-003,29,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition to that, drivers who contract COVID-19 as a result of providing services in a heightened COVID-19 risk situation – for instance, ferrying Ag+ passengers for their PCR tests – they can apply for a one-time relief of $3,000 through The Courage Fund for frontliners that is administered by the National Council of Social Service."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00030,2021-11-03-T-004,30,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is Singapore’s inflation outlook in the near and medium terms; (b) what are the causes of the rising inflationary pressures; (c) what is the assessment of the likely impact of these inflationary pressures on low and middle income households; and (d) whether there will be mitigating measures to reduce the impact of rising costs arising from these inflationary pressures on households and businesses.
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00031,2021-11-03-T-004,31,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the risk of a sharp accumulation of external and domestic cost pressures affecting prices of goods and services in Singapore; and (b) other than tighter monetary policy, what steps can be taken to mitigate some of the effects of rising costs over the next 12 months."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00032,2021-11-03-T-004,32,Alvin Tan,"Speaker, Sir, with your permission, can I take Question Nos 5 and 6 together, please?"
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00033,2021-11-03-T-004,33,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00034,2021-11-03-T-004,34,Alvin Tan,"CPI-All Items inflation picked up to 2.5% on a year-on-year basis in Q32021, from 2.3% in Q2. The rise in domestic inflation came largely on the back of higher external inflation due to increases in global energy and food commodity prices, and persistent supply bottlenecks in key global industries and transport hubs."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00035,2021-11-03-T-004,35,Alvin Tan,"On the energy front, crude oil prices have risen to above US$80 per barrel since early October on account of the decision by OPEC+ to keep supply increases modest, even as oil demand continues to pick up due to the global economic recovery and the rally in global natural gas prices. Higher oil and gas prices will translate to higher electricity prices domestically. And about 95% of our electricity is currently generated using natural gas. That is on the energy front."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00036,2021-11-03-T-004,36,Alvin Tan,"On the food front, global prices for food commodities such as cereals and vegetable oil have risen due to supply constraints arising from weather-related disruptions, manpower and labour shortages and export restrictions in key food-producing countries, amidst rising global demand. Higher global food prices will in turn, naturally, exert upward pressure on domestic food prices."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00037,2021-11-03-T-004,37,Alvin Tan,"Meanwhile, supply bottlenecks for goods such as semiconductors, and congestion at ports around the world, have contributed to a rise in the prices of imported consumer goods in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00038,2021-11-03-T-004,38,Alvin Tan,"Domestically, we expect labour costs to rise as the labour market continues to recover and border restrictions limit non-resident worker inflow. We also expect to see inflation in accommodation to persist due to strong rental demand for housing amidst construction delays caused by labour shortages in the construction sector. Against this backdrop, CPI-All Items inflation is projected to come in at around 2% this year and average 1.5% to 2.5% in 2022."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00039,2021-11-03-T-004,39,,"But despite this rise in inflation, Singapore’s economic recovery for the year remains on track. Barring a major setback in the global economy, GDP growth is expected to come in between 6% and 7% for the full year, mainly supported by outward-oriented sectors, such as the manufacturing, finance and insurance, and information and communications sectors."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00040,2021-11-03-T-004,40,,"The Government recognises that higher inflation is a cause of concern for Singaporeans, particularly those in lower-income households. To manage the cost of living pressures faced by Singaporeans, the Government adopts a multi-pronged approach."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00041,2021-11-03-T-004,41,,"First, in view of the external and domestic cost pressures, MAS recently announced a shift towards an appreciating path for the trade-weighted Singapore dollar – the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. A strong Singapore dollar will help to mitigate imported inflation and temper domestic cost, to ensure price stability over the medium term. That is one."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00042,2021-11-03-T-004,42,,"Second, the Government strives to maintain and manage domestic supply-side constraints, and these include the supply of industrial and commercial spaces to help moderate business cost increases, and reduce the knock-on impact on consumer prices. During the pandemic, the Government has also disbursed rental relief to help businesses cope with their rental costs. In addition, policy measures, such as the Wage Credit Scheme, Jobs Support Scheme and Jobs Growth Incentive Scheme, provide some support for businesses in terms of their manpower and labour costs."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00043,2021-11-03-T-004,43,,"Third, to mitigate the impact of rising global food prices, the Government has diversified our food import sources to help ensure that the prices of our food supplies remain competitive."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00044,2021-11-03-T-004,44,,"Fourth, we will continue to pay particular attention to Singaporeans from lower-income households who need support for their basic living expenses. The Government will continue to provide assistance through ComCare and the permanent GST Voucher scheme. From time to time, the Government also introduces one-off support measures, such as the Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme. In addition, Singaporeans from lower- to middle-income households who have experienced involuntary job or income loss due to the economic impact of COVID-19 can apply for financial assistance provided through schemes, such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and the Courage Fund."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00045,2021-11-03-T-004,45,,The Government will continue to monitor inflation and cost of living pressures closely and adjust our policies where necessary.
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00046,2021-11-03-T-004,46,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his detailed answers. I have just one supplementary question and somewhat related to Question No 5 as well. Beyond the mitigation measures that the Minister of State mentioned just now – we are thankful for the support for expenses and other mitigation measures – can he give an update on other pre-emptive efforts?"
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00047,2021-11-03-T-004,47,Saktiandi Supaat,"For example, the Retail Price Watch Group (RPWG). An update on that would be quite useful. Slightly more than a decade ago, we created that to keep a watch on retail prices and address concerns on any alleged profiteering and excessive pricing of daily necessities and food items. And the role of cooperation with retailers going forward, as a price stabiliser, I think that element of pre-emptive efforts might be useful at this point in time as we proceed into 2022. If we can have further updates from the Minister of State, please."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00048,2021-11-03-T-004,48,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his s upplementary question. The Government maintains a very strong vigilant stance on price increases and price fluctuations. The Retail Price Watch Group that the Member mentioned has stood down but we have other measures and ways of monitoring the price of goods. For daily necessities, consumers can make use of CASE's Price Kaki app to compare prices of groceries and hawker food to help them to make more informed purchasing decisions."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00049,2021-11-03-T-004,49,Alvin Tan,"To also help Singaporeans cope with higher prices for their daily necessities, the Government continues to work with cooperatives, such as NTUC FairPrice and community support programmes, such as the price freezes on essential items under house brands over the period of March 2019 to December 2020."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00050,2021-11-03-T-004,50,Alvin Tan,"But as I have mentioned earlier on, I wanted to just reinforce that it is a whole multi-prong approach, a broad and expansive approach that the Government is taking to tackle inflation."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00051,2021-11-03-T-004,51,Alvin Tan,"We have mentioned earlier on MAS' monetary policy adjustments, the Government managing supply-site constraints, which is not unique to Singapore but globally. Third, is diversifying food import sources and energy sources over the long term, as we have debated in the House for the last two days. And of course, our particular focus and assistance to lower-income households, including, for example, U-Save vouchers for households living in for 4-room or smaller HDB flats to help them with utility bills."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00052,2021-11-03-T-004,52,Alvin Tan,"So, our approach has been multi-pronged. Our approach has been wide and expansive and broad to help our people to cope with inflation."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00053,2021-11-03-T-004,53,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00054,2021-11-03-T-004,54,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, the Minister of State mentioned about monetary policy as one of the very important tools to fight imported inflation. So, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether there is further scope for our strong Singapore dollar to mitigate imported inflation, given that it does impact our export competitiveness; whether, from our trade consideration standpoint, is there further room for that to be used to mitigate imported inflation?"
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00055,2021-11-03-T-004,55,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, besides imported inflation, we are also faced with domestic cost pressures. The Minister of State also mentioned about the push for higher wages, the additional measures from the COVID-19-related safe management procedures that the businesses got to follow, the energy prices and others. My concern is whether all these upward pressures on cost will lead to businesses pricing in this anticipated increase in cost and, therefore, will create a spiral in inflation. So, I would like to ask the Minister of State how the Government is going to manage this, whether there will be interventions and also for items that are outside the CPI basket, how are we going to mitigate those cost increases as well."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00056,2021-11-03-T-004,56,Alvin Tan,"I t hank the Member for his supplementary questions. As we all know, inflation is a clear and present issue confronting and vexing economists this week, as well as central bankers and policy-makers. If you look at it, US consumer price inflation is at 5.4%, the highest in 13 years. South Korea just announced that inflation hit a 10-year high in October."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00057,2021-11-03-T-004,57,Alvin Tan,"As I earlier updated, MAS had already made a decisive move on 14 October by raising the slope of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. It had also said that it would continue to track the growth and inflation trajectories over the next few quarters."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00058,2021-11-03-T-004,58,Alvin Tan,"This is one tool in the toolbox; there are many others. And maybe I will just share with the Member how we are dealing with inflationary issues. If you look at the thing as a whole, this issue has been more acute because of two major challenges. The first is that the supply-side constraints and the second is an economic rebound."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00059,2021-11-03-T-004,59,Alvin Tan,"The supply-side constraints have been in place, pre-COVID-19, but accentuated during COVID-19. The economic pick-up will lead to pent-up demand, economic rebounding, and so, you have huge demand but then, continued supply constraints. If you look at what is happening right now, despite all of these input prices, our exports have in fact seen a very strong recovery this year. Our non-oil domestic exports (NODX) increased 9.1% year-on-year in Q3 2021, following the 10.1% expansion in Q2 2021. This NODX growth in Q3 2021 was driven mainly by exports of non-electronic products such as specalised machinery, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00060,2021-11-03-T-004,60,Alvin Tan,"When our export performance is strong, it means also that our exports remain competitive in international markets. And we must keep these markets open so that our goods can flow out. It also manages a hedge against other price increases, inbound. How do we do so? The Member knows that we have undertaken a whole slew and suite of major trade facilitation and multilateral frameworks, such as RCEP, CPTPP. These build upon our existing FTAs with major trade partners, representing 85% of global GDP."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00061,2021-11-03-T-004,61,Alvin Tan,"At the same time, the other way to manage this is to ensure that our supply chains remain connected and that means diversifying our import and export markets. We have and are negotiating, and have successfully concluded negotiations on the Pacific Alliance Singapore Free Trade Agreement. It is another arrow in our quiver such that we can open up new markets for our imports to alleviate, again, inflationary pressures. We will also continue to support local enterprises so they can deepen their export capabilities in the global economy and ensure our exports remain relevant and competitive in the international market in the long term."
2021-11-03-T-004-S-00062,2021-11-03-T-004,62,Alvin Tan,"The other aspects to reduce inflationary pressures include also the supply of industrial and commercial spaces to help moderate business costs and reduce the knock-on impact on consumer prices. These also include measures such as disbursing rental relief to help businesses cope with their rental costs and, hopefully, have knock-on effects to consumers as well."
2021-11-03-T-005-S-00063,2021-11-03-T-005,63,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Government expects that ComCare cash assistance will remain elevated for the 2021 financial year.
2021-11-03-T-005-S-00064,2021-11-03-T-005,64,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, in FY2020, MSF disbursed $236 million in ComCare assistance, a 56% increase from FY2019’s $151 million. The number of individuals who benefited from ComCare schemes also increased by 22% over the same period, to around 96,000 individuals in FY2020."
2021-11-03-T-005-S-00065,2021-11-03-T-005,65,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"These increases were largely due to the larger number of ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) beneficiaries in FY2020 and reflected the economic impact of COVID-19 as well as the additional flexibility that Social Service Offices (SSOs) exercised during the pandemic to provide ComCare support. For instance, MSF automatically extended the duration of support of existing ComCare beneficiaries whose assistance ended between May and October 2020 by a further six months, to provide them with a longer runway to stabilise their circumstances. Most new ComCare beneficiaries assisted between April and December 2020 also received at least six months of assistance."
2021-11-03-T-005-S-00066,2021-11-03-T-005,66,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SMTA supports low-income and vulnerable individuals and families who may be looking for work, are temporarily unable to work or are earning a low income and require financial assistance. SMTA beneficiaries receive comprehensive support, which may include cash assistance for their basic living expenses, and assistance with their household and medical bills. They may also receive employment assistance such as job search and/or training and be assisted through referrals to other government agencies and community partners for casework and counselling. These help the families to tide over their temporary financial difficulty and support them in their journey to regain stability and self-reliance."
2021-11-03-T-005-S-00067,2021-11-03-T-005,67,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In line with the improving economic and labour market situation, the ComCare data for the first six months of FY2021 show that the number of beneficiaries has steadily decreased since FY2020. We do not expect the number of ComCare beneficiaries or quantum disbursed in FY2021 to remain at the FY2020 levels, although it may still be higher than pre-COVID-19 levels in FY2019."
2021-11-03-T-005-S-00068,2021-11-03-T-005,68,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF will continue to work closely with other Government agencies and our community partners to provide support and assistance to individuals and families in need. We welcome everyone to step forward and volunteer with us in various initiatives as well. They can register their interest through www.volunteer.gov.sg. If anyone encounters a neighbour, friend or family member who needs support, they can call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 or refer them to the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre for assistance."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00069,2021-11-03-T-006,69,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Education what measures are in place to support continuity of school financial assistance when a student is posted from one school to another, including postings taking place after national examinations."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00070,2021-11-03-T-006,70,Sun Xueling,"The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), which provides support for Singaporean students from lower-income households, is provided for one year at a time. This allows support to be reviewed and adjusted as family circumstances vary with time. Students under MOE FAS continue to receive support, if they transfer across schools in the course of the school year, without having to re-apply."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00071,2021-11-03-T-006,71,Sun Xueling,"For graduating students who wish to apply for financial assistance in the school they will be progressing to, they can make an FAS application in their current school towards the end of the graduating year. If the application is successful, the students will receive the FAS support in the school they will be progressing to. This arrangement covers our Government and Government-aided schools, specialised schools and independent schools."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00072,2021-11-03-T-006,72,Sun Xueling,"To support students progressing into our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), MOE also shares with Institute of Technical Education (ITE), the Polytechnics and the Autonomous Universities (AUs) the list of former MOE FAS recipients who are posted to them. This allows the institutions to reach out to these students and provide them with financial support, if needed."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00073,2021-11-03-T-006,73,Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00074,2021-11-03-T-006,74,Tan Wu Meng,"I would like to thank the Minister of State for her answer. Sir, my Clementi resident told me she has just been retrenched, with her last day of work in December. Her Primary 6 daughter is on school-based FAS and she is worried about what will happen in the new school. My resident told me that when she sought to apply for MOE FAS for the upcoming school year, she was told she had to wait till she had served the last day of her job, which would then take place in December, possibly towards the later part of December."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00075,2021-11-03-T-006,75,Tan Wu Meng,"Can I ask MOE two supplementary questions? Firstly, for school-based FAS, is there any way to facilitate handover of school-based FAS needy students between the old and new school, especially when these postings happen? Secondly, for MOE FAS, is there any way for MOE to consider pre-application requests from parents who have already received notice of retrenchment just before the end of the school year?"
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00076,2021-11-03-T-006,76,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his question. I would like to share that if he comes across residents who, unfortunately, need financial assistance, one immediate port of call can be ComCare, because MSF and MOE have established an arrangement since 2018 for students in mainstream schools, ITEs and Polytechnics to be concurrently assessed for financial assistance, when the Social Service Offices (SSOs) actually review their families' application for ComCare. In other words, if the resident that Dr Tan Wu Meng mentioned approaches ComCare, ComCare, through SSOs, would actually facilitate an application through the SSOs for financial assistance, as well as help with the application for school-based FAS."
2021-11-03-T-006-S-00077,2021-11-03-T-006,77,Sun Xueling,"The other point I wanted to mention on school-based FAS is, the specific example that Dr Tan had mentioned was because the student was a graduating student in Primary 6 and would be posting to a Secondary school or another school, and perhaps, at that point in time, it was not yet clear which school the student would be posted to. But I would just like to assure the Member that the MOE directs funds specifically towards the schools to administer school-based FAS, which is over and above the MOE FAS that I was talking about. So, once there is clarity as to which school the child would be posted to, then when the child applies for school-based FAS, the school specifically will make those assessments and ensure that the funds are paid in an expeditious manner to the student."
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00078,2021-11-03-T-007,78,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for Communications and Information what are the Ministry’s plans to ensure that all students have easy and low-cost access to high-speed Internet outside of school.
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00079,2021-11-03-T-007,79,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, the Government is committed to equipping all Singaporeans, including students, with a baseline of affordable digital access."
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00080,2021-11-03-T-007,80,Rahayu Mahzam,"Almost all households with school-going children have access to broadband. Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)'s NEU PC Plus and Home Access programmes provide a subsidised device and broadband connectivity to low-income households, including those with school-going children. From January 2020 to September 2021, over 20,000 low-income households with school-going children have benefited through the NEU PC Plus programme."
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00081,2021-11-03-T-007,81,Rahayu Mahzam,"IMDA's digital access programmes are complemented by MOE's provisions for students to access the Internet to support Home-Based Learning. During the recent full Home-Based Learning in May 2021, schools loaned out Internet-enabling devices to students who lacked Internet access at home. Students also had the option to return to school to use computing facilities. Alternatively, students may also tap on Wireless@SG deployed at public spaces, like the public libraries and Community Clubs (CC), for free out-of-home Internet connectivity."
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00082,2021-11-03-T-007,82,Rahayu Mahzam,"Citizens’ needs evolve, and the Government reviews our initiatives to ensure citizens from needy households also have access to affordable high-speed Internet. Most recently, in 2020, broadband speed under IMDA’s NEU PC Plus and Home Access programmes were increased from 300Mbps to 500Mbps. This is able to support a typical family for common daily activities, such as video calls and video streaming. The Government will continue to review our provisions to meet the digital connectivity needs of students outside school."
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00083,2021-11-03-T-007,83,Speaker,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong.
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00084,2021-11-03-T-007,84,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for sharing and I would want to commend MOE and IMDA in the past two years in really equipping students and giving them digital access. One question is, given the proliferation of more digital and online educational resources and the increase in home-based learning, I was wondering whether the Ministry will consider further expanding the provision for Home Access programmes beyond the two years to better serve those in disadvantaged circumstances and give them more accessibility, especially outside of school and having to be at home?"
2021-11-03-T-007-S-00085,2021-11-03-T-007,85,Rahayu Mahzam,"I thank the Member for the question. I appreciate his concern for those who may be in a bit more disadvantaged situation. I would just like to highlight to the Member that for the Home Access beneficiaries, they can actually reapply at the end of the two-year period, as long as they meet the eligibility criteria and there is actually no limit to the number of times they can apply, as long as they can meet the eligibility requirements. And this applies also to the NEU PC Plus programmes. I understand his concerns and we are committed to equip all Singaporeans with the basic affordable digital access. So, we will continue to review the provisions to meet the needs, especially of those who are in a more disadvantaged situation, so that they have easy and affordable access to high-speed Internet outside school and in common places."
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00086,2021-11-03-T-008,86,Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will consider incorporating elderly-friendly, child-friendly and disabled-friendly internal and external features to ensure the relevance of HDB flats through all life stages; and (b) what has been the take-up rate of the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme to improve mobility and comfort for elderly residents since its introduction in 2012."
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00087,2021-11-03-T-008,87,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, since 2006, all new HDB developments have been built with universal design principles and barrier-free access to create an environment that is user-friendly for all. For example, at the precinct-level, barrier-free routes link up blocks with major activity nodes. HDB also provides features, such as three-generation playgrounds, where playgrounds for children are located beside fitness stations for adults and seniors. For better wayfinding, HDB has started designing estates with features to facilitate easier recognition of places, such as larger font sizes for block numbers and the use of icons. Universal design features are also included in the HDB blocks and flats, such as wider corridors to facilitate wheelchair movement and rocker switches that are mounted at lower heights."
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00088,2021-11-03-T-008,88,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"To help HDB residents to age in place, HDB provides senior-friendly items to enhance the safety and mobility of our seniors in existing HDB flats through the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme."
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00089,2021-11-03-T-008,89,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"As of end September 2021, the EASE programme has benefited more than 242,000 households. HDB also offers short-lease two-room Flexi flats to meet the housing needs of seniors. These flats are fitted upfront with grab bars and seniors can choose from three Optional Component Scheme packages to pre-install selected fittings. In addition, HDB, MND and MOH have launched the Community Care Apartments (CCA), a new public housing typology that integrates senior-friendly design features with care services, and facilitates community building through social programmes and communal spaces. The first CCA pilot at Bukit Batok was launched for sale in Feb 2021 and we are studying plans for future CCA."
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00090,2021-11-03-T-008,90,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In line with HDB’s “Designing for Life” roadmap, HDB will continue to anticipate future needs and develop initiatives to enhance residents’ well-being across different life stages."
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00091,2021-11-03-T-008,91,Speaker,Mr Chong Kee Hiong.
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00092,2021-11-03-T-008,92,Chong Kee Hiong,"I thank the Minister of State for his reply. There are HDB units built on the ground level, with a few steps leading to the door. Not all units have sufficient common areas where a ramp could be built to facilitate wheelchair access. Can the Minister of State please share what feedback have they received on the pilot Wheelchair Lifter Programme? Can HDB roll out this programme to all the estates soonest?"
2021-11-03-T-008-S-00093,2021-11-03-T-008,93,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary question. Indeed, we launched the wheelchair lifters programme in December 2018 as a pilot programme, whereby about 10 households have participated and 10 wheelchair lifters have been installed. The feedback that we have received so far has been quite positive. The seniors found it easy to use and also it encourages the seniors to go out to the community more regularly than before. We are reviewing the scheme and we will take note of the Member's suggestion and request in our review."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00094,2021-11-03-T-009,94,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment regarding the Clean Tables Campaign to achieve a higher tray/crockery return rate (a) how many fines have been issued so far; (b) what is the general profile of those who have been warned or fined; (c) what are the most common reasons cited for non-return of trays; and (d) whether targeted public education can be provided for these diners.
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00095,2021-11-03-T-009,95,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Enforcement action against table littering at hawker centres started on 1 September 2021, following a three-month advisory period. For diners who do not clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter, enforcement officers will first advise them to do so. Diners who refuse to heed officers' advice will have their particulars taken down and be issued written warnings if it is their first offence. Only second or subsequent offenders will be issued fines or sent to Court."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00096,2021-11-03-T-009,96,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thus far, diners have been generally cooperative at our hawker centres, with many taking the initiative to return their trays and dirty crockery after eating or doing so when advised. The common reason given by diners for not clearing the table after eating is that they had forgotten. To date, one written warning has been issued to a diner for refusing to heed enforcement officers' advice to return the dirty crockery. No fines have been issued."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00097,2021-11-03-T-009,97,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Singapore Food Agency will also be commencing enforcement against table littering at coffeeshops and food courts from 1 January 2022, with a two-month advisory period from 1 November 2021 to 31 December 2021."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00098,2021-11-03-T-009,98,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We will continue with our extensive outreach efforts to ensure that the general public and key stakeholders are aware of the requirement to return their dirty trays and crockery after dining at public dining spaces. This includes multilingual outreach materials on mass media and social media platforms, onsite reminders at hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts, as well as collaborations with grassroots organisations, schools and youth groups. We hope more diners will exercise their social responsibility, return their dirty trays and crockery, and for this to become a social norm in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00099,2021-11-03-T-009,99,Speaker,Ms Joan Pereira.
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00100,2021-11-03-T-009,100,Joan Pereira,"Thank you, Speaker and I thank the Senior Minister of State too. I have one supplementary question. In view of the ongoing manpower crunches, as well as the roll-out of this Clean Tables Campaign to coffee shops and food courts, could the Ministry consider supporting the adoption of technology in coffee shops and food courts such as deploying tray return robots or automated food waste digesters so as to further improve the cleanliness and environment of these dining areas?"
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00101,2021-11-03-T-009,101,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. Indeed, as the Member has noted, the cleaning services and waste management sector are facing a manpower crunch. With the ageing population and declining workforce going forward, this manpower crunch is likely to become even more acute. The average age of our cleaners is 60 years today. So, indeed this self-service concept as part of the Clean Tables Campaign that we have initiated is the more sustainable way going forward, to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene or public dining spaces including at the coffee shops and food courts."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00102,2021-11-03-T-009,102,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"This revised table cleaning workflow will give assurance to our ageing cleaners that their services continue to be needed and appreciated, and also give them better clarity on where to focus on. It will also create a safer and better working environment and perhaps, that will also help in terms of meeting manpower constraints, with better retention, or people who are thinking of joining the sector, might actually do so."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00103,2021-11-03-T-009,103,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition, we also encourage the sector through our Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map to look into improving productivity, either through redesigning the workflow or by adopting technology, as the Member has mentioned. NEA-licensed cleaning companies, premise owners, tenants, eligible ones, can actually apply for the Environmental Services Productivity Solutions Grant or ESPSG, which provides funding support for them to purchase  cleaning and waste management equipment, such as autonomous cleaning robots and food waste digesters."
2021-11-03-T-009-S-00104,2021-11-03-T-009,104,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The first tranche of the ESPSG has concluded in August 2021 with a very strong demand, overwhelming demand indeed. We have approved 1,700 applications and committed a grant of $40.75 million. We are assessing the rest of the applications – about 1,200 to commit the remainder fund. NEA is also exploring the extension of this scheme."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00105,2021-11-03-T-010,105,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many companies have since closed down due to pressures from the COVID-19 pandemic; and (b) what are the current and future efforts to support local firms for post-crisis growth to maintain our status as an international business hub.
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00106,2021-11-03-T-010,106,Low Yen Ling,"Over the last two years, an average of around 3,840 firms were deregistered each month, similar to the period 2017-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, an average of more than 5,000 new firms were registered each month over the last two years, reflecting an increase in the total number of businesses operating in Singapore, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00107,2021-11-03-T-010,107,Low Yen Ling,"In the last two years, the Government has committed substantial resources to help our businesses weather the immediate impact of COVID-19. We are also helping our businesses prepare for post-COVID-19 recovery and continuing to enhance Singapore's position as a business hub in several ways."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00108,2021-11-03-T-010,108,Low Yen Ling,"Firstly, we are strengthening both our physical and digital connectivity. For example, we are gradually and carefully reopening our borders to more countries through arrangements such as the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). Our ports are kept operating throughout the pandemic to ensure supply chain resilience. We will continue to enhance both our air and sea connectivity."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00109,2021-11-03-T-010,109,Low Yen Ling,"The Government is similarly extending Singapore's digital connectivity by establishing a network of Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with like-minded partners. We are also investing in digital infrastructure and capability building for our businesses and workers to access such opportunities. For example, the Grow Digital initiative helps SMEs tap on established e-commerce platforms to better access global markets, while the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) encourages our SMEs to transform and strengthen their capabilities. In addition, we are partnering with industry stakeholders in this endeavour. An example is the SGTraDex, which is a common data infrastructure that enables our businesses to transit into the digital domain. It also builds a stronger and more robust supply chain ecosystem for international trade flows."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00110,2021-11-03-T-010,110,Low Yen Ling,"Secondly, we are supporting our businesses in capturing new and emerging opportunities, such as those in the green sector. As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 announced earlier this year, we will help our enterprises and workforce harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, and develop innovative solutions for the green economy. These include, amongst others, carbon trading and related services, low-carbon solutions, green finance, and green infrastructure. Enterprise Singapore recently launched the Enterprise Sustainability Programme which supports businesses, especially SMEs, to build capabilities and capture new opportunities in this exciting space."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00111,2021-11-03-T-010,111,Low Yen Ling,"Thirdly, we are helping businesses transform for the future economy, sector by sector. The Future Economy Council chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Heng is currently refreshing the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to meet the accelerated changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. For each of the 23 ITMs, we are working with our tripartite partners, including the private sector to update our sectoral strategies to seize new opportunities, as well as to improve productivity and wages of our workers through digitalisation, innovation, internationalisation, upskilling and job redesign."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00112,2021-11-03-T-010,112,Low Yen Ling,"These are the fundamentals which will underpin our competitiveness and ensure that Singapore remains as a global-Asia node for technology, innovation and enterprise. We are confident that through close partnership with Singaporeans as well as the business community, we will be able to emerge stronger together."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00113,2021-11-03-T-010,113,Speaker,Dr Wan Rizal.
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00114,2021-11-03-T-010,114,Wan Rizal,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for the very comprehensive reply. Can the Minister of State give us a sense of the growth outlook across the sectors, especially the sectors where business formations are taking place? We have heard about digitalisation and the formation of DEAs and how it would help Singapore. Could you elaborate a little bit more about MTI's plan to grow the capabilities and the potential of enterprises in sustainability or even in the green economy?"
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00115,2021-11-03-T-010,115,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member, Dr Wan Rizal, for his two supplementary questions."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00116,2021-11-03-T-010,116,Low Yen Ling,"First, he asked about the growth outlook by sector. Growth will continue to be driven by outward-oriented sectors, like manufacturing, wholesale trade, finance and insurance and information and communications technology (ICT). The recovery in tourism related, aviation related or consumer-facing sector is projected to be gradual, in comparison."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00117,2021-11-03-T-010,117,Low Yen Ling,"He asked about the business formation numbers in sectors. Let me just give him a bit of insights to this. Business formations continue to flourish, in spite of the COVID-19 crisis. Earlier on, I cited the numbers, the formation number and the number of firms that closed. More new businesses have started compared to the number of businesses closed. Between March 2020 and September 2021, over this one-and-a-half year period, a total of 73,036 business entities have ceased while 103,585 business entities have formed. So, again, more business formation numbers."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00118,2021-11-03-T-010,118,Low Yen Ling,"In the same period, he asked about sectors, the sectors with the largest number of new businesses formed included professional services, wholesale trade and retail."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00119,2021-11-03-T-010,119,Low Yen Ling,"His second supplementary question is on sustainability. I have cited about digitalisation, internationalisation, innovation; and he correctly pointed out the sustainability is going to be important as a competitive advantage for our SMEs. And indeed, we are encouraging our SMEs to integrate sustainability into their business, into their business process as a competitive advantage and to grow their capabilities in the new economy by tapping on the newly launched Enterprise Sustainability Programme. It was launched by Minister Gan Kim Yong about a month back on the 1 October. It is a $180 million-dollar scheme. So, what does it entail?"
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00120,2021-11-03-T-010,120,Low Yen Ling,"The Enterprise Sustainability Programme supports our SMEs in a few areas  (a) in sustainability training; (b) capability development; and (c) product development. And also, in the month of October, ESG launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme–Green which will then catalyse funding for our SMEs to develop green solutions and technology. The Enterprise Sustainability Programme does not just support our SMEs at the enterprise level. It is very important for us to also take a sectoral view and an ecosystem-wide approach."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00121,2021-11-03-T-010,121,,"So, MTI and ESG will certainly work very closely with the trade associations and chambers (TACs), industry partners, to develop a vibrant sustainability ecosystem to support our SMEs in their sustainability efforts, from capability development to product development. At the same time, taking an ecosystem-wide approach to leverage key enablers like financing, certification, training and other sustainability services."
2021-11-03-T-010-S-00122,2021-11-03-T-010,122,,"So, I want to use the opportunity to assure the Member Dr Wan Rizal and the House that the Government is fully committed to support the growth and the future of our SMEs in the post-COVID-19 recovery. We will not let up our support. In fact, we will continue to support our SMEs to adapt and develop their businesses to seize new opportunities, whether in internationalisation, digitalisation or sustainability, and other areas."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00123,2021-11-03-T-011,123,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many companies in the tourism-related and retail sectors have closed down since January 2020; (b) what is the employment situation in the tourism sector including number of tour guides who have been redeployed; and (c) what further efforts can the made to stimulate local retail demand and transform the tourism sector to position themselves for future growth opportunities.
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00124,2021-11-03-T-011,124,Alvin Tan,"From January 2020 to September 2021, 8,600 retail businesses ceased operations. This was 330 more than the same period between 2018 and 2019. However, there were 15,570 new retail businesses set up, resulting in a net increase of 6,970 retail firms over the same period from January 2020 to September 2021."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00125,2021-11-03-T-011,125,Alvin Tan,"For the tourism industry, despite some exits since January 2020, new entrants have kept the number of tourism businesses in operation fairly stable. For example, the number of licensed hotels today remains at around 420 despite 13 hotels having ceased operations. The total number of licensed tourist guides is still around 2,900, even with 175 tourist guides choosing not to renew their licences during this period. Travel agents, unfortunately, have been impacted more – 157 travel agents ceased their operations. This represent 8% of all licensed travel agents, although around 30 new travel agents entered the market."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00126,2021-11-03-T-011,126,Alvin Tan,"The Government has supported the sector with the highest tier of support under the Jobs Support Scheme. Together with other broad-based Government support measures, this has helped cushion the impact of COVID-19 on the sector. Initiatives such as the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers (SRV) scheme have also helped stimulate demand by encouraging Singaporeans to rediscover our city, our tourism product offerings and support local tourism businesses, including those for travel agents."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00127,2021-11-03-T-011,127,Alvin Tan,"The launch of the SRV scheme has also helped tourist guides. Between the launch of the SRV scheme and the start of the Heightened Alert in May 2021, monthly tour participants grew fivefold from just over 10,000 to more than 50,000. To further help our tourist guides cope with business costs, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) also waived the tourist guide licence fees in 2020 and 2021, as well as test fees for those who wish to be licensed in another language."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00128,2021-11-03-T-011,128,Alvin Tan,"STB expects tourism to reach pre-pandemic levels in the next few years. In the meantime, we are helping companies in the retail and tourism sectors transform and upgrade themselves so that they can better capture opportunities when travel resumes."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00129,2021-11-03-T-011,129,Alvin Tan,"With regard to retailers, for retailers looking to develop their online sales channels, they can receive support from Enterprise Singapore’s (ESG) E-Commerce Booster Package, which defrays the costs of joining e-commerce platforms, or use ESG’s Productivity Solutions Grant to build capabilities in areas such as digital marketing as well as e-commerce. The tourism sector is also receiving support from STB to pursue transformation efforts to ready itself for the recovery. Examples include the Business Improvement Fund for technology innovation and the adoption of business models and processes to improve productivity and competitiveness; and the Training Industry Professionals in Tourism scheme which supports employee upgrading and talent and leadership development."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00130,2021-11-03-T-011,130,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00131,2021-11-03-T-011,131,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for the answers. It is good to hear the Minister of State mentioned that the SRV scheme that has been very useful for the retail and tourism sector. But he did share that there were 157 travel agents which have ceased operations."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00132,2021-11-03-T-011,132,Saktiandi Supaat,"My supplementary question is, in particular, about those working in the tourism and retail sector. I have a number of residents who used to work or are working in the tourism and retail sectors, which have been in partial limbo over the past one and a half years. My question is, whether we have the number of tour guides or retail frontline workers who have switched industries or switched jobs permanently."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00133,2021-11-03-T-011,133,Saktiandi Supaat,"Can I also ask about the status of our local travel agencies in Singapore, and if they will survive, going forward? Also, what outlook can we expect for the retail sector and the travel agency business in this endemic scenario that we are going to face over the next year or so?"
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00134,2021-11-03-T-011,134,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Let me go to our tourism sector first. Between January 2020 and 20 October 2021, 4,373 workers were retrenched across the core tourism industries, 58% of whom were locals. However, with early intervention and support under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Initiative, 67% of the locals, who were retrenched between January and September 2020, found new employment within six months."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00135,2021-11-03-T-011,135,Alvin Tan,"With regard to the tourist guides, while we do not track the redeployment of tourist guides, close to 250 tourist guides have served as Safe Distancing Ambassadors with STB."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00136,2021-11-03-T-011,136,Alvin Tan,"As I mentioned earlier on in my reply, the SRV scheme has also helped local tourist guides with monthly tour participants growing fivefold between the launch of the SRV scheme and the start of the Heightened Alert in May 2021. I also mentioned earlier on STB waiving the tourist guide licence fees as well as test fees."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00137,2021-11-03-T-011,137,Alvin Tan,"So, all of these in concert, and all of these in totality, are helping preserve our capability in our tourism sector, which is an important sector, while we await the recovery in global travel as well as the tourism industry. But we must preserve this. The SRV, for example, helps us to create new product offerings locally, with tourist guides forming new products. I think it will put them in good stead for when travel resumes in earnest, and when tourists come to Singapore and are able to enjoy the sights and sounds here in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00138,2021-11-03-T-011,138,Alvin Tan,"Just back to the retail question. In 2020, 1,180 retail employees had been retrenched. This translates to 16.9 retrenched employees per 1,000 employees. Of these retrenched employees, 56% were able to enter a different industry within six months after retrenchment."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00139,2021-11-03-T-011,139,Alvin Tan,"But I also wanted to share a little bit about Enterprise Singapore's Retail Industry Transformation Map (ITM), as a forward-looking roadmap for our retail industry."
2021-11-03-T-011-S-00140,2021-11-03-T-011,140,Alvin Tan,"The Retail ITM has done a study and they have looked across the key trends in the retail industry. The key trends are digitalisation, on-demand retail, hyper-personalisation of goods, in effect, and conscious consumerism, which is very much related to the sustainability trend that we are seeing. So, we are supporting our retail sector to take on and to ride these trends, moving forward."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00141,2021-11-03-T-012,141,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the sectoral productivity growth rates, trends and outlook in Singapore since the onset of COVID-19; and (b) whether there are new measures or productivity needed to better measure the hybrid model of work productivity."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00142,2021-11-03-T-012,142,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the productivity of various sectors of the economy has been uneven, reflecting in large part the differentiated impact of the pandemic."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00143,2021-11-03-T-012,143,Alvin Tan,"In 2020, labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, or AHW, rose for outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and finance and insurance. For example, the productivity of the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors increased by 18.6% and 3.1%, respectively. By contrast, sectors which were severely disrupted by travel and domestic restrictions, such as construction, transportation and storage, accommodation and F&B services, experienced declines in productivity. In particular, the productivity of the transportation and storage and F&B services sectors fell by 22.1% and 17.7%, respectively."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00144,2021-11-03-T-012,144,Alvin Tan,"For 2021, productivity growth is expected to remain positive for the most outward-oriented sectors, given the pick-up in global economic activity. Sectors that continue to be disrupted by weak travel demand and domestic restrictions such as transportation and storage and F&B services, are not likely to return to pre-COVID-19 productivity levels, as activities in these sectors are not expected to recover fully this year."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00145,2021-11-03-T-012,145,Alvin Tan,"Since 2015, MTI has compiled statistics on real value-added per actual hour worked, to complement statistics on real value-added per worker. Real value-added per actual hour worked is recognised internationally, including by the International Labour Organization (ILO), to be the most appropriate measure of labour productivity as actual hours worked capture the intensity of labour input more accurately."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00146,2021-11-03-T-012,146,Alvin Tan,"In the context of a hybrid model of working, real value-added per actual hour worked also provides a more accurate measure of labour productivity, as it accounts for the varying intensity of labour input by employees under different types of work arrangements. These include (a) flexi-time arrangements that grant employees flexible work schedules, depending on their work, of course, and personal commitments; (b) flexi-load arrangements that involve employees who are hired on a part-time or project basis; as well as (c) flexi-place arrangements that allow employees to telecommute and record hours worked in both workplace settings and at home."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00147,2021-11-03-T-012,147,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00148,2021-11-03-T-012,148,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his answers. I have got two supplementary questions."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00149,2021-11-03-T-012,149,Saktiandi Supaat,"First is in relation to my earlier Parliamentary Question (PQ), can the Minister of State share about the outlook for the productivity by sector, if possible, in 2022; and beyond 2022, given growth and other variables?"
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00150,2021-11-03-T-012,150,Saktiandi Supaat,"The second supplementary question I have is, in relation to the second part of my PQ. Are there plans for MTI to do any further granular data studies to examine productivity, in terms of both labour and multi-factor productivity, especially during the COVID-19 period and possibly into the endemic period? The reason is, if we look at the actual hours worked data, which is good that it is in quarterly basis, whether there will be more measures that MTI plans to collect, going forward, similar to what other developed countries like in the US, so as to measure productivity more accurately, going forward?"
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00151,2021-11-03-T-012,151,Alvin Tan,I thank the Member for his two supplementary questions. I will take the measurement of labour productivity first and then go into the outlook across sectors.
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00152,2021-11-03-T-012,152,Alvin Tan,"First is on how is labour productivity typically measured and what are the differences between existing labour productivity measures? Labour productivity measures actually measure how effectively or efficiently labour inputs are used to produce output. They are computed in terms of, as I mentioned, real value-added (VA) per actual hour worked, or real VA per worker. There are differences between these two because of changes in the average number of hours worked per worker over time. I think that also has been quite accentuated during COVID-19."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00153,2021-11-03-T-012,153,Alvin Tan,"Of the two measures that we talked about, real VA per AHW is recognised internationally including, as I mentioned earlier, by ILO, to be a better measure of labour productivity, because the actual hours will capture the intensity of labour input more accurately."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00154,2021-11-03-T-012,154,Alvin Tan,"In Singapore's context, this measure has also become more relevant in recent years with the rising number of part-time workers in the economy and the cyclical changes in the number of hours worked by full-time workers."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00155,2021-11-03-T-012,155,Alvin Tan,"If you look at TFP or Total Factor Productivity, which is also known as multi-factor productivity, is also an alternate measure of productivity and captures how efficiently both capital and labour are used together in the production process. It is computed as a residual on an annual basis and is defined as a change in GDP not attributed to changes in capital and labour inputs."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00156,2021-11-03-T-012,156,Alvin Tan,"So, for example, an increase in TFP may be due to factors such as a rise in technology, improvements in management practices and organisational structures or maybe even the diffusion of technology across firms. So, while not a 100% accurate indication, I think this particular measure, for now, manages to capture productivity in the most accurate form. But we will be open to looking at other ways to measure, given the changing nature of work across the world and given how COVID-19 has also looked at productivity across workplace and at home."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00157,2021-11-03-T-012,157,Alvin Tan,"With regards to the outlook for productivity, both Minister of State Low and myself have shared earlier on that the growth as well as recovery across sectors are uneven. There are domestically oriented sectors and there are the outwardly oriented sectors. The domestically oriented sectors experienced a steeper contraction in value-add in 2020, a reduction in 15.9% as compared to the outward oriented sector's decrease in 0.9%. But our productivity performance tends to be pro-cyclical and so it has resulted in an uneven productivity across various sectors."
2021-11-03-T-012-S-00158,2021-11-03-T-012,158,Alvin Tan,"I wanted to also just share a little bit that what we are doing is we are not being stagnant in this regard, productivity has been an issue in advanced economies and in particular, Singapore has been managing or trying to increase productivity for decades."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00159,2021-11-03-T-013,159,Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for Manpower what measures will be implemented to alleviate the disruptions to our manpower resources, particularly in sectors such as cleaning and hospitality which will experience higher labour demand in tandem with more visitors entering Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Lane schemes."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00160,2021-11-03-T-013,160,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our economy and labour market. In 2020, total employment contracted by 166,600 and this is the sharpest contraction in two decades. Foreign workers accounted for all of the employment decline, with Government support measures cushioning the impact on local workers."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00161,2021-11-03-T-013,161,Tan See Leng,"In 2021, even as parts of the economy recover, border restrictions continue to constrain the supply of foreign workers to meet the pick-up in demand. At the same time, some foreign workers who were already in Singapore have returned home. In the first half of 2021, the total number of foreign workers continued to decline by another 32,600. All of this had led to increasing tightness in the labour market. The number of seasonally adjusted job vacancies in the overall economy rose to an all-time high of 92,100 in June 2021. The number of vacancies is especially acute in sectors which rely most on foreign workers, such as construction and manufacturing. The seasonally adjusted job vacancy to unemployed person ratio increased to 1.63 in June 2021, exceeding one for the first time since March 2019."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00162,2021-11-03-T-013,162,Tan See Leng,"The Government has been working closely with companies to support their manpower needs. Firstly, we are helping companies to expand local hiring. Through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, we have placed 140,000 locals into jobs and skills opportunities between April 2020 and end August 2021. The Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) was introduced in September 2020 and has supported 58,000 businesses to hire more than 400,000 locals thus far. Overall, the number of employed residents has risen by 43,500 since the start of 2020."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00163,2021-11-03-T-013,163,Tan See Leng,"Secondly, the Government is helping companies retain and hire foreign workers. For example, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is helping to match employers with hiring needs to experienced foreign workers already in Singapore but who are no longer needed by their current employers. We are also facilitating the safe inflow of new foreign workers to alleviate the manpower crunch. Our priority is to ensure that the risk of COVID-19 importation is well-managed to protect our public health."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00164,2021-11-03-T-013,164,Tan See Leng,"With the progressive easing of border restrictions, it will also help facilitate the normalisation of foreign worker inflow. MOH has recently announced the easing of measures for travellers from various countries, including Malaysia."
2021-11-03-T-013-S-00165,2021-11-03-T-013,165,Tan See Leng,"The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely, we will continue to work with the industry and companies to adjust to the progressive easing of restrictions and the return of demand."
2021-11-03-T-014-S-00166,2021-11-03-T-014,166,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Education with regard to the proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) marking system for English subject assignments on the online Student Learning Space (SLS), what safeguards will be in place to ensure automated marking does not undermine the potential for students' writing to develop creativity, cadence, personality and flair."
2021-11-03-T-014-S-00167,2021-11-03-T-014,167,Sun Xueling,"Our use of educational technology aims to complement and not dilute our teachers' central role in guiding students to learn and master different subjects, especially for higher-level skills. For instance, the Learning Feedback Assistant for English Language (LFA(EL)) provides personalised feedback directly to students on areas such as spelling and grammar. Teachers can then focus their attention to guide students on more complex aspects of language construction and to develop higher-level skills like creative expression, persuasiveness and tone."
2021-11-03-T-014-S-00168,2021-11-03-T-014,168,Sun Xueling,"For students, immediate feedback from the LFA(EL) can also encourage them to write more often, be more self-directed in their learning and to work on their basic writing errors. These help to strengthen their mastery over the basics of writing, which in turn allows them to devote more effort on more demanding aspects like creative expression."
2021-11-03-T-014-S-00169,2021-11-03-T-014,169,Sun Xueling,"With the LFA(EL), our teachers have an additional tool to complement their professional practice, enabling them to further develop our students' writing skills."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00170,2021-11-03-T-015,170,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) from 2018 to 30 September 2021, what is the annual number of road accidents and violations involving heavy vehicles; (b) how many of these accidents involved lorries ferrying workers; and (c) how will the Ministry ensure better road safety to deter such accidents."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00171,2021-11-03-T-015,171,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, there were 2,160 road accidents involving heavy vehicles from January 2018 to June 2021. The annual breakdown of these accidents is as follows  in 2018, 776 accidents; in 2019, 690; in 2020, 426; and in 2021 up till June this year, 268."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00172,2021-11-03-T-015,172,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"There were 57,639 traffic violations committed by heavy vehicles from January 2018 to June 2021. The annual breakdown of these violations is as follows  in 2018, 19,004; in 2019, 19,449; in 2020, 13,900; and in 2021 up till June, 5,286."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00173,2021-11-03-T-015,173,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,We do not yet have the figures for the third quarter of 2021.
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00174,2021-11-03-T-015,174,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Traffic Police (TP) does not track if the vehicles involved in accidents were ferrying workers.
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00175,2021-11-03-T-015,175,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"TP adopts a three-pronged approach of education, engagement and enforcement to enhance road safety. On the education and engagement front, TP regularly conducts road safety talks to educate heavy vehicle drivers on safe driving habits and holds dialogue sessions with the industry and key stakeholders."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00176,2021-11-03-T-015,176,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"TP is also partnering other Government agencies, such as LTA and MOM, to monitor the development of suitable technologies that can help discourage speeding and ensure road safety, such as Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). ADAS helps improve the situational awareness of drivers and warns them of collision risks. Today, small and medium enterprises which wish to install ADAS or other vehicular safety technologies on their heavy vehicles can apply for support from the Productivity Solutions Grant, administered by Enterprise Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00177,2021-11-03-T-015,177,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"That said, we recognise that there will always be errant heavy vehicle drivers who, despite the Government's outreach efforts, continue to drive irresponsibly. TP will take strong enforcement action against these motorists."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00178,2021-11-03-T-015,178,Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00179,2021-11-03-T-015,179,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, can the Minister of State share what are the top three most frequent traffic violations committed by these heavy vehicles. According to MOM's mid-year workplace safety and health statistics, vehicular accidents were the top cause of workplace deaths for the first half of 2021."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00180,2021-11-03-T-015,180,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"In September, I filed a Parliamentary Question to ask about the yearly breakdown of the almost 20,000 speeding violations by lorries in the past five years and found that speeding cases were rising annually up until last year when COVID-19 resulted in a halt to many economic activities. Clearly, employers are putting their workers' lives at risk when ferrying them at the back of lorries especially when some of these lorry drivers have the propensity to speed and it could be down to just sheer luck that there has not been even more fatalities on our roots."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00181,2021-11-03-T-015,181,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Therefore, I would like to ask whether MHA would reconsider some of my proposals to add a speed limiter to all lorries much as how we have already done in heavy vehicles today and whether there could be a review on having dedicated transport for workers instead of having the workers co-mingle with goods at the back of the lorries."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00182,2021-11-03-T-015,182,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. With regard to his suggestion about speed limiters as well as the lorries, the Government will bring this back and take a look at these suggestions."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00183,2021-11-03-T-015,183,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"With regard to the breakdown of the top three most frequent traffic violation committed by heavy vehicles, indeed, number one is speeding, number two is red light running and number three is careless driving."
2021-11-03-T-015-S-00184,2021-11-03-T-015,184,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. The Clerk will now proceed to read the Orders of the day.

2021-11-03-T-016-S-00188,2021-11-03-T-016,188,Lawrence Wong,"Sir, earlier this year, this House debated and passed the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or SINGA for short, to reactivate Government borrowing for financing nationally significant infrastructure, subject to strict safeguards."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00189,2021-11-03-T-016,189,Lawrence Wong,"The borrowings under SINGA are clearly distinguishable from a separate category of Government borrowing for non-spending purposes under the Local Treasury Bills Act, or LTBA, and the Government Securities Act, or the GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00190,2021-11-03-T-016,190,Lawrence Wong,"The LTBA and the GSA allow the Government to borrow, not for spending, but for specific purposes, such as market development and meeting the investment needs of the Central Provident Fund. To emphasise, the proceeds from such borrowings cannot be spent by the Government."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00191,2021-11-03-T-016,191,Lawrence Wong,"So, to delineate between the two types of borrowing in legislation, the borrowings which are done under SINGA for SINGA projects and borrowings which cannot be spent, this Bill before the House seeks to merge the LTBA into the GSA, and to streamline our legislation on Government borrowings. This will help to provide better clarity on the profile of the Government's debt."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00192,2021-11-03-T-016,192,Lawrence Wong,Let me share some background on the LTBA and the GSA.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00193,2021-11-03-T-016,193,Lawrence Wong,"The LTBA authorises the issuance of Treasury Bills to develop the domestic short-term debt market and to meet market demand for short-term Government debt securities. The GSA authorises the issuance of longer-tenor securities, like the Singapore Government Securities, or SGS, to develop the domestic debt market and meet the investment needs of the Central Provident Fund."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00194,2021-11-03-T-016,194,Lawrence Wong,"Both the LTBA and the GSA expressly provide that the proceeds of borrowings raised are to be paid into the Government Securities Fund. This is an important safeguard, because the monies in the Government Securities Fund can only be invested. This is why the monies raised under the LTBA and GSA cannot be used to finance the Government's spending needs."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00195,2021-11-03-T-016,195,Lawrence Wong,"While the LTBA and GSA were introduced separately with different processes, the Government has gradually harmonised the treatment of Treasury Bills and SGS over the years."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00196,2021-11-03-T-016,196,Lawrence Wong,"For example, the LTBA was amended in 1996 to account for the proceeds and expenditures of Treasury Bills under the Government Securities Fund, instead of the Consolidated Fund, similar to Government securities in the GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00197,2021-11-03-T-016,197,Lawrence Wong,"In 2001, the minimum denomination for Treasury Bills of $10,000 was revised downwards to $1,000 to facilitate greater retail participation, similar to that for tradable securities under the GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00198,2021-11-03-T-016,198,Lawrence Wong,"And in 2004, the GSA was amended to change the borrowing limit of Government securities issued from a gross to a net limit for a more meaningful measure of Government's liabilities, similar to that for Treasury Bills under the LTBA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00199,2021-11-03-T-016,199,Lawrence Wong,"So, given the overlaps in purpose and the harmonisation of treatment of securities under both Acts, this Bill is therefore introduced to merge the LTBA into the GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00200,2021-11-03-T-016,200,Lawrence Wong,"The Government Securities Act will be renamed as the Government Securities (Debt Market and Investment) Act, which I will refer to as the renamed GSA for short, to reflect this consolidation within the name of the Act."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00201,2021-11-03-T-016,201,Lawrence Wong,The renamed GSA will provide for the issuance of Treasury Bills and the existing LTBA will be repealed.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00202,2021-11-03-T-016,202,Lawrence Wong,The changes introduced through this Bill are largely administrative in nature with no change to the substance of the individual Acts.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00203,2021-11-03-T-016,203,Lawrence Wong,"There is no change to the provision, limiting the use of monies in the Government Securities Fund from being used solely for investment purposes. Therefore, the monies raised under the Bill cannot be used for spending."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00204,2021-11-03-T-016,204,Lawrence Wong,"With the merger of the Acts, the current borrowing limits under the LTBA and GSA, which are $105 billion and $960 billion respectively, will be combined to form a single borrowing limit of $1,065 billion under the renamed GSA. There is no change to the overall borrowing limit."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00205,2021-11-03-T-016,205,Lawrence Wong,"As is the practice today, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will continue to calibrate Treasury Bill and SGS issuances based on market development needs. And to ensure transparency, MAS will continue to publish the breakdown of outstanding SGS and Treasury Bills."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00206,2021-11-03-T-016,206,Lawrence Wong,There is also no change to the existing features and outstanding issuances of Treasury Bills and Government Securities issued under the LTBA and the GSA. The outstanding Treasury Bills will be automatically subsumed under the renamed GSA.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00207,2021-11-03-T-016,207,Lawrence Wong,"Besides the merging of LTBA into the GSA, this Bill will also repeal borrowing provisions in other Acts that are no longer necessary."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00208,2021-11-03-T-016,208,Lawrence Wong,"Specifically, the Bill will repeal the External Loans Act and Treasury Deposit Receipts Act, as well as borrowing provisions in the Developmental Investment Fund Act."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00209,2021-11-03-T-016,209,Lawrence Wong,"There are no outstanding borrowings under these Acts. So, with the SINGA and renamed GSA, the Government does not foresee the need to borrow under these Acts."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00210,2021-11-03-T-016,210,Lawrence Wong,"The Constitution and other acts, such as the MAS Act will be amended to substitute references to LTBA and GSA with the renamed GSA, and remove references to the External Loans Act. The amendments to the Constitution will be raised by the Minister for Law after this."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00211,2021-11-03-T-016,211,Lawrence Wong,"We have consulted the President on both this Bill and the amendments to the Constitution, as they provide for the raising of loans by the Government and a single borrowing limit for Government securities and Treasury Bills. The President is supportive of the Bills."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00212,2021-11-03-T-016,212,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, let me conclude. This Bill consolidates various pieces of legislation on Government borrowings for specific non-spending purposes into a single legislation under the renamed GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00213,2021-11-03-T-016,213,Lawrence Wong,"Going forward, the Government will rely on the renamed GSA to borrow for specific non-spending purposes and the SINGA to borrow for spending on nationally significant infrastructure."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00214,2021-11-03-T-016,214,Lawrence Wong,"We will ensure that the borrowings for spending and non-spending purposes are transparent and clearly differentiated in the processes for the issuances of securities, reporting and public communications. For example, the new SGS issued for infrastructure financing has been named as SGS(Infrastructure) bonds and the existing SGS bonds renamed as SGS(Market Development) bonds to reflect the different purposes of borrowing."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00215,2021-11-03-T-016,215,Lawrence Wong,"And again, I would like to emphasise that the Singapore Government has a strong balance sheet with no net debt. Borrowings for non-spending purposes, which will be consolidated under the renamed GSA in this Bill, will continue to make up the majority of Singapore Government's borrowings. Through this Bill, we will provide greater clarity on the Government's debt profile. Sir, I beg to move."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00216,2021-11-03-T-016,216,Lawrence Wong,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00217,2021-11-03-T-016,217,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00218,2021-11-03-T-016,218,Liang Eng Hwa,"Mr Speaker, I wish to declare my interest that I work in a financial institution which trade and transaction in securities, including Government securities."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00219,2021-11-03-T-016,219,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, the Government has issued more debts over the year, largely for investments, and also to develop the bond market and to manage the CPF monies."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00220,2021-11-03-T-016,220,Liang Eng Hwa,"Earlier this year, the House has also passed the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act (SINGA) in which the proceeds raised can only be used to fund major and very long-term key infrastructures."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00221,2021-11-03-T-016,221,Liang Eng Hwa,"So, the Government's balance sheet has indeed expanded and hence, it does make good sense do some ""housekeeping"" to the various Government borrowing legislations, and in particular, this Bill to consolidate the GSA and LTBA as well as make consequential amendments and repeals to the other Acts."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00222,2021-11-03-T-016,222,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, notwithstanding my support, I have three questions for the Minister."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00223,2021-11-03-T-016,223,Liang Eng Hwa,"Firstly, can I use this opportunity to seek an update on the outstanding amount of securities that the Government issued under the GSA and the LTBA?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00224,2021-11-03-T-016,224,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, clause 14 of the Act merge the two borrowing limits, the GSA and the LBTA, into a single borrowing limit of $1.065 trillion. Can I ask the Minister for the basis of this change?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00225,2021-11-03-T-016,225,Liang Eng Hwa,The reasons for my question are as follows.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00226,2021-11-03-T-016,226,Liang Eng Hwa,"Firstly, SGS are long-dated debts greater than one year, while the Treasury Bills tends to be just a few months to a year. Both debts come with different tenures, repayment obligations. The Treasury Bills tend to be more liquid in the trading markets because it is shorter dated. Hence, from the credit market standpoint, the two debts, say, the three-month Treasury Bill versus 20-year SGS would be accorded with different risk ratings."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00227,2021-11-03-T-016,227,Liang Eng Hwa,Does MOF see the need to retain this separate borrowing limits for these two buckets of issuances given that they both have different risk profile?
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00228,2021-11-03-T-016,228,Liang Eng Hwa,"My third question is, the main bulk of the securities issued by the Government is the Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) which I believe account for about over 70% of the SGS. This is issued to CPF Board so that the Government can pay the bond coupon rates to the CPF members, which match the interest that CPF members receive. These bonds are not traded in the market and are directly placed with CPF. Hence, this is not for the purpose of creating high quality liquid assets for the financial institutions or to build a domestic risk-free yield curve, as opposed to the purpose of SGS."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00229,2021-11-03-T-016,229,Liang Eng Hwa,"Because of its sheer size, this SSGS, and that it will continue to grow in tandem with higher wages and growth in our resident workforce, we can expect the SSGS to get even more sizeable as the CPF savings increase."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00230,2021-11-03-T-016,230,Liang Eng Hwa,"As the SSGS is aggregated with the SGS, the overall debt level of the Government will come across as very high relative to our GDP and give the impression that a lot more SGS is issued or traded in the market."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00231,2021-11-03-T-016,231,Liang Eng Hwa,"These CPF related issuances, the SSGS, are also not invested by external investors because it is hold by the CPF Board, and its size of issuance and coupon rates therefore do not have any impact on the Singapore bond market nor its liquidity."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00232,2021-11-03-T-016,232,Liang Eng Hwa,"Hence, I would suggest that MOF consider classifying these private placed securities which it privately placed to CPF Board as CPF Bond rather than called it the SGS, and it should come under a separate borrowing limit and, of course, to be approved by Parliament and the President."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00233,2021-11-03-T-016,233,Liang Eng Hwa,"These would give greater clarity to the market participants and analysts on the level of the borrowing by the Government. Sir, notwithstanding my queries, I support the technical amendments in this Bill."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00234,2021-11-03-T-016,234,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00235,2021-11-03-T-016,235,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, I understand that the stipulations in the Government Borrowing (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, are of a largely technical nature, aiming to repeal various mostly spent acts, and to consolidate any borrowing by the Government across sectors. This is fairly obscure, so obscure, in fact, that I noticed that, initially, I was the only Member slated to speak on this but evidently, two others have since found this topic similarly irresistible."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00236,2021-11-03-T-016,236,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I favour such simplification and I do not have substantive concerns about the specificities in the proposed amendments. I do wish, however, to make a few points that I think have more to do with potentially unintended consequences of the current iteration of the Bill. These have to do with the debt limit precluding the acceptance of advance deposits by the MAS for Treasury Bills and the lack of justification for rejecting sales."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00237,2021-11-03-T-016,237,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The first point worth noting is that clause 14 with the Bill proposes to set the borrowing limit for Government loans at $1.065 trillion, which represents the combined limits of $960 billion for the Government securities and $105 billion Treasury Bills that currently exists under two separate Acts. This new limit may then be increased by Parliamentary resolution, which simplifies, since logically, all forms of debt, whether short-term or long-term should, of course, be treated as a component of the overall liability picture and, hence, subject to the same form of debt ceiling discipline."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00238,2021-11-03-T-016,238,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Given this observation, would it not also make sense to enfold remaining instruments under Government borrowing, such as single bonds issued under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act to the same limit? I understand, of course, as Minister Wong has mentioned that this is, in fact, a separate accounting convention."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00239,2021-11-03-T-016,239,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This limit, to be clear, is relatively small, at $90 billion and there is a clear benefit through consolidating under one roof, which is that a consolidated limit would simplify monitoring and allow fiscal policy-makers to ultimately focus on the single figure."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00240,2021-11-03-T-016,240,Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, the natural objection, of course, is this, is that the Government maintains these separate limits for debt that serve developmental objectives, such as infrastructure, which is the case for SINGA versus those issued under risk transfer and investment purposes for the purposes of CPF funds as mentioned earlier, or to fulfil liquidity and debt functions."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00241,2021-11-03-T-016,241,Jamus Jerome Lim,"MOF has steadfastly held that all these require separate limit accounts. But from the perspective of understanding the underlying economics, all monies is ultimately fungible and it is unclear why debt issued under one type of accounting constraint cannot subsequently be redeployed to other functions so long as it is only a matter of protocol, rather than one entrenched in actual legislation that prevents subsequent transfer."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00242,2021-11-03-T-016,242,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Of course, such deviations need not occur under this Government but it could easily occur under another perhaps more profligate one. Hence, even if we did wish to maintain separate debt ceilings for the purposes of accounting, perhaps it may be worth nevertheless incorporating these distinct limits into this Bill."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00243,2021-11-03-T-016,243,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This is especially the case since insofar as financial markets are concerned, they view the consolidated Government balance sheet as a whole, as they should. Indeed, SINGA bonds do not appear to have affected the Singapore Government's overall credit rating, which is yet another economic reason to not hive off such limits for the instrument."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00244,2021-11-03-T-016,244,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Concomitantly, it is also important to calibrate the frequency with which this limit is modified. While fiscal rules such as a reasonable debt limit have been used in many countries and can play an important role in ensuring the sustainability of fiscal affairs, a debt ceiling that is too frequently binding can wreak havoc on the efficient operation of government, as the experience of the United States, where bipartisan brinksmanship routinely plagues efforts to raise the debt ceiling, reminds us."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00245,2021-11-03-T-016,245,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To this effect, may I inquire whether this Government has considered whether this limit is appropriate? What is the premise or justification behind the current debt limit ceiling amount of $1.065 trillion? Is there a body that routinely examines the veracity of this debt limit and how frequently should we expect to change this?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00246,2021-11-03-T-016,246,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The second point, Mr Speaker, I wish to raise has to do with how clause 20 of the Bill restricts the ability of other Government entities, in particular, MAS from accepting advance deposits in anticipation of raising loans by way of Treasury Bills."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00247,2021-11-03-T-016,247,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While this may be a sound principle in practice, history is rife with examples of central banks that have gone ahead and monetised debt on behalf of a profligate sovereign, breeding inflation as a result."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00248,2021-11-03-T-016,248,Jamus Jerome Lim,It is worth noting that two recent developments may yet necessitate additional flexibility for the monetary authority to act in an anticipatory manner.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00249,2021-11-03-T-016,249,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The first such circumstance, as Members of this House would be aware of, has to do with the zero lower bound faced by nominal interest rates. Although Singapore has never quite faced this problem in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 and the MAS, unlike most central banks, targets the nominal exchange rate rather than the policy interest rate, it is nevertheless worth keeping in mind that one prescription to the problem of the zero lower bound is to allow for central banks to intervene directly in short-term money markets by issuing securities on their own account."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00250,2021-11-03-T-016,250,Jamus Jerome Lim,The second situation is to do with the emerging central bank digital currency landscape (CBDC). Such CBDCs are likely to become a permanent part of the future of central banking worldwide and I understand that MAS is on the forefront of this and even commissioned the sandbox for studying the usage of such currencies.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00251,2021-11-03-T-016,251,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While the detailed findings of this exercise have yet to be made public, it is reasonable to ask if the practical implementation of CBDCs may yet require flexibility for MAS to be able to accept such advance deposits for Treasury Bills and if this Bill would preclude such action."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00252,2021-11-03-T-016,252,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Hence, while I accept that these two conditions are somewhat unusual, it is nevertheless worth asking if this particular clause in the Bill may unnecessarily tie the hands of the MAS to operate in a modern global macroeconomic environment."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00253,2021-11-03-T-016,253,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Finally, clause 24 of the Bill explicitly states that the authority may, ""refuse any application to take up Government securities or Treasury Bills issued without assigning any reason."""
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00254,2021-11-03-T-016,254,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While I accept the prerogative of the Government to reserve the right to refuse the sale of his debt to any given entity, it is also surely reasonable, at least, for Singaporean purchases to be provided some form of explanation for why they are unable to purchase the debt of their own Government."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00255,2021-11-03-T-016,255,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Notwithstanding these reservations and questions, Mr Speaker, I support the Bill."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00256,2021-11-03-T-016,256,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00257,2021-11-03-T-016,257,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I support this Bill, which will bring about greater clarity by consolidating and harmonising the Government's borrowing powers."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00258,2021-11-03-T-016,258,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have two points of clarification to make.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00259,2021-11-03-T-016,259,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My first point is on the merging of limits under the Government Securities Act and the Local Treasury Bills Act. The new section 11 of the Act will replace the separate borrowing limits for Government securities and Treasury Bills with a single borrowing limit.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00260,2021-11-03-T-016,260,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My concern is that we currently have a much higher borrowing limit for Government securities than for Treasury Bills – more than nine times as much. The Government had its rationale for maintaining this disparity.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00261,2021-11-03-T-016,261,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"As such, I have three related questions"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00262,2021-11-03-T-016,262,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"One, what was the initial intent of having a much higher borrowing limit for Government Securities and Treasury Bills? Does the Ministry see this initial intent as no longer relevant, given that this intent is no longer reflected in the combined borrowing limit?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00263,2021-11-03-T-016,263,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Two, will this combined limit now result in a greater reliance on Treasury Bills compared to Government securities?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00264,2021-11-03-T-016,264,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Three, will the Government internally maintain a separate borrowing limit for Government Securities and Treasury Bills?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00265,2021-11-03-T-016,265,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second point is on the approval required for borrowing beyond the $1.065 trillion limit.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00266,2021-11-03-T-016,266,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Both the existing section 11 and the new section 11 allows the Government to borrow beyond its limit as long as there is a Parliamentary resolution and presidential concurrence. I would like to seek some clarification on the approval process.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00267,2021-11-03-T-016,267,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In both cases, all the Government needs is for the Parliament to pass a resolution by simple majority and for the President to concur. The $1.065 trillion limit appears to make no difference."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00268,2021-11-03-T-016,268,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Is the borrowing limit merely meant to signal the Government's stance on maximum borrowing? Relatedly, will the Ministry consider introducing a strengthened check-and-balance for when the Government seeks to increase its borrowing limit or to borrow beyond the existing limit?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00269,2021-11-03-T-016,269,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"For example, we could require such activities to require a two-third vote of approval by the Parliament in addition to the President's concurrence. This process change would reflect the sanctity of the borrowing limit and the severity of increasing or bypassing it."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00270,2021-11-03-T-016,270,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00271,2021-11-03-T-016,271,Speaker,Minister Lawrence Wong.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00272,2021-11-03-T-016,272,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Members of the House who have shared their views on this Bill."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00273,2021-11-03-T-016,273,Lawrence Wong,"Let me first reiterate that this is largely an administrative exercise. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa said, it is housekeeping. There is no change to the substance of our borrowing legislation, the overall borrowing limit and the safeguards to raising the current limit. But let me clarify some of the questions and points that Members have raised."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00274,2021-11-03-T-016,274,Lawrence Wong,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the outstanding amount of securities under the Local Treasury Bills Act (LTBA) and the Government Securities Act (GSA).
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00275,2021-11-03-T-016,275,Lawrence Wong,"As at 30 September, we have $65 billion under the LTBA and $699 billion under the GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00276,2021-11-03-T-016,276,Lawrence Wong,Both Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Louis Ng also asked about the rationale for merging the LTBA and GSA borrowing limits. Let me explain.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00277,2021-11-03-T-016,277,Lawrence Wong,"First, with the introduction of SINGA, we thought that it would be timely to consolidate legislation of Government borrowings for non-spending purposes so as to distinguish these from borrowing for spending purposes under SINGA. By pooling the LTBA and the GSA together under the renamed GSA, this will emphasise that the borrowings issued under this Act are entirely for non-spending purposes."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00278,2021-11-03-T-016,278,Lawrence Wong,"This would also address what Assoc Prof Jamus Lim was saying. He had suggested to pool it together as one combined limit, together with SINGA. But from the Government's point of view, for better governance and for better control of processes, we want to distinguish between borrowing for non-spending, which is done under LTBA and GSA, and borrowing under SINGA, which is borrowing for infrastructure, which we spend. I think it is prudent and advisable to have different limits for both."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00279,2021-11-03-T-016,279,Lawrence Wong,"Between GSA and LTBA, both are borrowing for non-spending reasons – one for short-term securities, another for longer-term securities. And we felt that there is no need to distinguish so much between the two. Furthermore, over time, the processes for treatment of LTBA and Treasury Bills and Government securities have become harmonised over the years. Therefore, we see scope for pooling them together."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00280,2021-11-03-T-016,280,Lawrence Wong,"Second, a combined limit under this renamed GSA will also provide MAS greater flexibility to calibrate the issuances and tenors of debt issuances based on market conditions. In fact, other countries such as the US and Germany similarly manage their short and long-tenor securities under a single limit."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00281,2021-11-03-T-016,281,Lawrence Wong,"With this combined borrowing limit, we do not expect the proportion of short- and long-term securities under the renamed GSA to be significantly different from today. This is because a large proportion will continue to be used to issue Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS), which is mainly driven by CPF balances and its investment needs. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa has correctly highlighted, the amount of SSGS issuances is expected to increase over time due to growth in our resident labour force and wages."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00282,2021-11-03-T-016,282,Lawrence Wong,The remaining borrowing limit will mostly be utilised by the issuance of Treasury Bills and Singapore Government Securities (SGS) to support market development and it is market demand and conditions that will influence the amount and the tenor of such debt to be issued.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00283,2021-11-03-T-016,283,Lawrence Wong,"In particular, MAS will calibrate the amount and tenor of such issuances to meet the regulatory needs of financial institutions for high quality liquid assets and to establish a robust sovereign yield curve to support the development of the Singapore dollar corporate bond market. Indeed, it will not be in the Government's interest to issue debt of certain tenors beyond what the market can reasonably absorb as it would skew the interest rate curve used to price Singapore dollar denominated financial instruments and result in capital misallocations."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00284,2021-11-03-T-016,284,Lawrence Wong,"So, to reiterate again, we are combining all the borrowings that are for non-spending purposes – CPF, market development – pooling them together under this renamed GSA."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00285,2021-11-03-T-016,285,Lawrence Wong,"We believe it is prudent and, from a financial point of view, provides better control – to have this differentiated from borrowing for SINGA projects, which is borrowing which will be used for financing of actual projects. That will be governed separately under SINGA and with a separate limit."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00286,2021-11-03-T-016,286,Lawrence Wong,"On Mr Liang Eng Hwa's suggestion for a separate borrowing limit for SSGS, I think he highlighted the need to provide clarity to market participants and analysts."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00287,2021-11-03-T-016,287,Lawrence Wong,"Here, we do not believe there is a need for a separate limit – to carve out SSGS – because if the purpose is to provide clarity and transparency, indeed, the composition of borrowing, be it SSGS, SGS or Treasury Bills, this will be published and will be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. MAS will continue to publish monthly the breakdown of outstanding SGS and Treasury Bills that are issued."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00288,2021-11-03-T-016,288,Lawrence Wong,"Next, Mr Louis Ng asked about the purpose of this borrowing limit and if the governance over increases in borrowing limits could be further strengthened to reflect the sanctity of the borrowing limit and the severity of increasing or bypassing it. I think Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also alluded to this in his response."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00289,2021-11-03-T-016,289,Lawrence Wong,"Let me clarify. There is really nothing sacrosanct about the borrowing limits. These are not permanent hard caps. In fact, the Government reviews the borrowing limits periodically and we will come back to the Parliament to raise the limits through Parliamentary resolutions where required. The most recent was in January this year."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00290,2021-11-03-T-016,290,Lawrence Wong,"For example, as demand for SSGS grows due to rising CPF balances, then, we will start to reach the limit. Likewise, demand for SGS and Treasury Bills will change, depending on regulatory and investment needs and market conditions."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00291,2021-11-03-T-016,291,Lawrence Wong,"What is important to understand is that the key safeguard, the key legislative safeguard in the Government Securities Act is that none of these borrowings can be spent. Like I said, it is differentiated from SINGA borrowings. Under the GSA, all of the borrowing proceeds are invested. Therefore, such borrowings do not lead to additional debt burdens."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00292,2021-11-03-T-016,292,Lawrence Wong,"Given that we already such a legislative safeguard under the GSA, some may ask why then is there still a need for a borrowing limit?"
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00293,2021-11-03-T-016,293,Lawrence Wong,"Our view is that this borrowing limit, while it is not a permanent hard cap, serve as an additional layer of checks and safeguards. It is useful for monitoring and each time we get close to the limit and we need to raise the limit, the Government would then have to come back to Parliament and get the agreement to raise this through Parliamentary resolution. Thereafter, the President will act independently in her discretion to concur with this resolution."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00294,2021-11-03-T-016,294,Lawrence Wong,"With the merger of the LTBA into the GSA, there will not be any change to the existing safeguards and processes that we have in place today."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00295,2021-11-03-T-016,295,Lawrence Wong,"Finally, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also asked about two clauses of the Bill, clause 20 on the acceptance of advance deposits by MAS and whether this unnecessarily ties the hands of MAS. We do not believe so. Clause 20 does not hinder us from effective monetary policy at all today. Clause 24 on the reserving the right to refuse a sale of debt to any entities, yes, that is in place in legislation. But should such a scenario were to arise, the Government will make clear its reasons for refusal."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00296,2021-11-03-T-016,296,Lawrence Wong,"But in any case, we will continue to review and update all aspects of legislations and should there be new developments in the marketplace or new requirements, we will periodically update legislation where necessary."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00297,2021-11-03-T-016,297,Lawrence Wong,"In summary, Sir, this Bill seeks to provide clarity on the Government’s debt profile, and reflect that the majority of the Government borrowings will continue to be issued under the renamed GSA for non-spending purposes."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00298,2021-11-03-T-016,298,Lawrence Wong,"I assure Members of this House that our fiscal position remains strong with borrowings. We will review our debt limits regularly to ensure that we continue to borrow within our means and remain in a net asset position. With this, Sir, I beg to move."
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00299,2021-11-03-T-016,299,Speaker,Any clarifications? Very good. Everyone is short and concise today.
2021-11-03-T-016-S-00300,2021-11-03-T-016,300,Speaker,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2021-11-03-T-017-S-00305,2021-11-03-T-017,305,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a second time”."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00306,2021-11-03-T-017,306,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, this Bill is related to the next Bill on the Order Paper, the Judicial Service (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, which will make consequential changes to various Acts arising from the amendments to the Constitution."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00307,2021-11-03-T-017,307,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, may I have your permission for the debate on both Bills to take place now. There is substantial overlap to both. Members can raise questions or express their views on both Bills during this debate. We would still have the formal Second Reading of the Judicial Service (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, to ensure that the necessary procedural requirements are dealt with."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00308,2021-11-03-T-017,308,Speaker,Please do.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00309,2021-11-03-T-017,309,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, this Bill makes several amendments to the Constitution to restructure the Singapore Legal Service. In essence, the Bill will  (a) establish a separate Judicial Service, overseen by a new Judicial Service Commission (JSC); and (b) make consequential changes to the Legal Service, which will be overseen by a reconstituted Legal Service Commission (LSC)."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00310,2021-11-03-T-017,310,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have consulted the President on the amendments, some of which affect her discretionary powers. The President supports these amendments."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00311,2021-11-03-T-017,311,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I will begin by briefly touching on the history of the Legal Service. It will give Members some context for the changes being proposed today.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00312,2021-11-03-T-017,312,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The framework for the Legal Service was established via the 1959 Constitution, which marked Singapore’s transition to internal self-government. Over the years, adjustments were made to the way the Legal Service was run. But the fundamental structure remained unchanged for many decades, until two rounds of major changes."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00313,2021-11-03-T-017,313,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In 2007, a comprehensive review was done. Major changes were made to create a more systematic talent management system. There were two key changes to the Constitutional structure."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00314,2021-11-03-T-017,314,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, the composition of the LSC was expanded. Since independence, Members will note that the LSC had comprised the Chief Justice (CJ), the Attorney-General (AG), the Chairman of the Public Service Commission (Chairman/PSC), a Supreme Court Judge and two members of the PSC, as nominated by the Chairman/PSC. Unlike today, all of the members of the LSC were members by virtue of some other office that they held separately."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00315,2021-11-03-T-017,315,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The 2007 changes widened the LSC’s membership. The CJ, AG and Chairman/PSC would continue to be on the LSC. But in addition, up to six additional members, who need not be Supreme Court Judges or PSC members, could be nominated by the Prime Minister, the CJ and the Chairman/PSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00316,2021-11-03-T-017,316,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The rationale was to bring in members, including those from the private sector, with a wider range of experience, for example, in personnel management, or who have knowledge of the legal service or the legal profession."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00317,2021-11-03-T-017,317,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"A second key change that was made then was to put in place a system of autonomous personnel boards (PBs), which would have charge over different classes of Legal Service Officers (LSOs). I will cover this in more detail later on in my speech."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00318,2021-11-03-T-017,318,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The second major change happened in 2014. There was a significant shift in favour of specialisation, in response to the increasing scope and complexity of legal work. Two separate career tracks were introduced for the LSOs in the middle ranks  the judicial and legal tracks."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00319,2021-11-03-T-017,319,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,LSOs in the middle-ranks could elect to specialise along either track. They could be posted to jobs within either the Judicial or the Legal Branch to build experience. The PBs were also restructured along the Branch lines to oversee the career development pathways of the LSOs in the respective tracks.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00320,2021-11-03-T-017,320,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The enduring challenge has been our very small pool of talent, due to our small size. This has been the raison d’etre for keeping with an integrated model. LSOs could be deployed interchangeably across Judicial and Legal Branches over the course of their career."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00321,2021-11-03-T-017,321,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This principle was, in fact, recognised very early on."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00322,2021-11-03-T-017,322,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The 1955 Malayanisation Commission, which was set up to accelerate the pace of localising the public service, in preparation for self-government, recommended that Legal Service officers be transferred from the Judicial side to the Legal side and vice versa, so as to “give officers an all-round training, and also to overcome the present objection of potential recruits to having experience limited to one side of the Service only which leads to a monotonous and incomplete professional career.” It was also agreed that all-round experience was beneficial, and that it would be best for officers to have experience at the Bar, on the Bench, as well as in the Attorney-General’s Department."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00323,2021-11-03-T-017,323,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At the time of Independence, we only had 45 LSOs. It took 30 years for the Legal Service to grow to 235 LSOs in 1995. This number grew significantly, to 589 LSOs in 2014. But even then, a fully specialist service was not a viable option. There were only 159 officers in the Judicial Branch; and 419 officers in the Legal Branch."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00324,2021-11-03-T-017,324,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With these numbers, having specialist services would leave officers, on the judicial side especially, lacking in opportunities for growth and career development. An “incomplete professional career”, to quote the words of the Malayanisation Commission. This would hamper the ability to attract and also retain talent."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00325,2021-11-03-T-017,325,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, the integrated model has worked well for our context. The Legal Service has played a key role in the development of our legal system and, consequently, in building Singapore’s reputation for commitment to the rule of law."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00326,2021-11-03-T-017,326,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,As Former CJ Yong Pung How said previously  “... the Legal Service has played a very important role in the success which Singapore has achieved as a nation. The work of many Legal Service Officers has contributed significantly to the recognition which our legal system has obtained as being among the best legal systems in the world.”
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00327,2021-11-03-T-017,327,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Today, over 800 LSOs serve in various crucial roles. LSOs in the Judicial Branch have contributed to building a world-class Judiciary that is both strong and trusted. LSOs in the Legal Branch, such as in the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and in the various Ministries, support effective and nimble functioning of the Executive and Parliament. For example, officers in AGC's Legislative Division, not only draft all the laws that are tabled and debated in this House, and I am sure Members are very familiar with all the Bills that have come, sometimes at breakneck speed, but also many pieces of subsidiary legislation that are critical for the effective functioning of the Executive."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00328,2021-11-03-T-017,328,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our international lawyers, they defend Singapore’s interests on the global front and make an outsize contribution to the continued vitality of the rules-based international order."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00329,2021-11-03-T-017,329,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The high levels of public trust in these institutions is also worth noting. A 2020 public perception survey by MinLaw found that there is a strong positive perception of our legal system and institutions among Singapore residents  95% of respondents agreed that we are governed by the Rule of Law; 90% had trust and confidence in our legal system and agreed that we had an efficient legal system; around 90% had a positive view of our Courts and of AGC.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00330,2021-11-03-T-017,330,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the world stage, in the Heritage Foundation’s 2021 Index of Economic Freedom, Singapore achieved the highest scores among 184 countries for judicial effectiveness. The World Economic Forum placed Singapore first in its 2019 Global Competitiveness Index, in terms of the efficiency of its legal framework in settling disputes."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00331,2021-11-03-T-017,331,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, this is not an exercise in theory or just in ranking numbers, but an exercise in building an institution that can actually deliver justice."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00332,2021-11-03-T-017,332,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The COVID-19 pandemic that we have just been experiencing and we are still in, has shown the depth and excellence of our Legal Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00333,2021-11-03-T-017,333,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,LSOs in both the Judicial and Legal branches have worked tremendously hard to deal with the challenges brought about by COVID-19. LSOs in the Legal Branch provided crucial legal support to the Government response to the pandemic.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00334,2021-11-03-T-017,334,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In January 2020, AGC stood up a Cross-Divisional Task Force, staffed by LSOs from the AGC and the legal divisions in various Ministries to provide urgent cross-cutting advice to the Government on all areas of the national pandemic response. For example, establishing Government quarantine facilities, contract tracing, border security, ensuring continued trade flows for essential goods and services and supplies, financing the various COVID-19 response budgets, and also vaccine procurement."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00335,2021-11-03-T-017,335,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In the first half of 2020 alone, AGC received over 1,300 COVID-19 related requests for advice. It responded to 69% of these requests within 24 hours and 78% of these within 48 hours. So, it is not just the quality, but also the speed of the responses from our officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00336,2021-11-03-T-017,336,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"LSOs, including drafters from AGC, worked closely with policy officers in many Ministries as well as with private sector representatives to roll out a series of urgent measures to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on individuals and businesses. These measures, which required major pieces of legislation to be drafted in record time, included, and I think Members will recall over the last 18 months  (a) temporary relief from contractual obligations, (b) a rental relief framework, done more than once; (c) simplified frameworks for financially distressed companies to liquidate their businesses or restructure their debts; and (d) a framework for the negotiation of contracts affected by the pandemic. All novel pieces of legislation."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00337,2021-11-03-T-017,337,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The quickly drafted legislation also allowed the Government to quickly implement new measures to control the spread of the disease. When circuit breaker measures were imposed to stop the spread of the virus, LSOs in the Courts, AGC and MinLaw, with other officers in the various agencies, worked together to formulate legislation to ensure the continued and undisrupted access to justice in spite of the pandemic."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00338,2021-11-03-T-017,338,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Courts operationalised a framework for remote hearings, developed a wide range of pandemic-related protocols. This ensured continued, undisrupted access to justice, even in the middle of the pandemic. To enforce the Infectious Diseases Act and COVID-19-related legislation, prosecutors worked closely with law enforcement agencies to assess the evidence and take quick action in all cases."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00339,2021-11-03-T-017,339,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the international front, LSOs in the International Affairs Division ensured that our COVID-19 measures remained consistent with our international obligations. As the situation improved in Singapore, they also assisted the Government in negotiating essential travel and air bubble arrangements to sustain economic exchanges and maintain our relevance as a regional and global hub."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00340,2021-11-03-T-017,340,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, these are just a few examples of the many contributions of the Legal Service in ensuring the fair and efficient administration of justice in Singapore during the pandemic."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00341,2021-11-03-T-017,341,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, what I have just outlined has been the model that we have adopted since Singapore achieved self-government. It has served us well to build up a Legal Service into the excellent institution that it is today and I think Members will agree that Singapore has benefited immensely."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00342,2021-11-03-T-017,342,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over the years, the Government has considered the question of whether an integrated or a specialist service would best serve Singapore's needs. We recognise the pros and cons both ways. The challenge has been and continues to be finding the right balance for our own circumstances, our own context and our needs."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00343,2021-11-03-T-017,343,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As mentioned, the small talent pool has been a constraint and that is something that we keep in mind as we consider the options."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00344,2021-11-03-T-017,344,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In July this year, Mr Murali Pillai, with the support of other Members, spoke on this matter in Parliament, calling on the Government to study the feasibility of setting up a separate JSC for judicial officers. Several members spoke and made good points about the increasing need for specialisation, including for the Judiciary, given the increasing factual and legal complexities of the cases presented to Court."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00345,2021-11-03-T-017,345,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Minister Shanmugam agreed with their observations that the benefits of specialisation are likely to continue to grow as the Legal Service continues growing and maturing as an institution.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00346,2021-11-03-T-017,346,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"After studying the matter further and discussing the matter in detail with the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, the Government decided that we can take this step."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00347,2021-11-03-T-017,347,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As Minister Shanmugam has said recently, the amendment is a finely balanced one. You can make a good case for not changing now and waiting. However, you can also consider the following."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00348,2021-11-03-T-017,348,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Legal Service has, since 2014, also grown significantly. It had, as of July 2021, 815 officers. Although this is still a relatively small number in context, it will allow us to have specialist services whilst retaining the benefits of the integrated model through a system of secondments."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00349,2021-11-03-T-017,349,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Officers today have many opportunities to gain meaningful exposure and develop their careers. Since 2014, both the Judicial Branch and the Legal Branch have made various changes to deepen specialist skillsets. There has also been a significant emphasis on the training of our judges to develop specific competencies required for the judicial role."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00350,2021-11-03-T-017,350,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In 2015, Members might recall the Singapore Judicial College was established as the central training body for the Judiciary. The State Courts and the Family Courts also run their own training programmes to help their judicial officers develop both deeper subject-matter knowledge as well as the necessary practical skills."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00351,2021-11-03-T-017,351,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At AGC, the AGC Academy was set up to take charge of managing the training for AGC officers. Competency frameworks were developed so that individual training roadmaps could be drawn for each officer according to their own area of practice and specific level of expertise."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00352,2021-11-03-T-017,352,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Academy also organises regular workshops and lectures by subject-matter experts in both core and developing areas of the law, for AGC officers. Cross-departmental clusters and specialist tracks have been established to help build expertise in particular areas of law."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00353,2021-11-03-T-017,353,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, the proposed restructuring will build on these efforts, better support specialisation of roles and competencies required of LSOs. Each Commission will focus on the particular demands of their respective services. They will have flexibility to adapt their personnel management and development frameworks according to their respective services' specific needs."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00354,2021-11-03-T-017,354,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The shift to a specialist model is not so much to address the problems of today but really a matter of forward planning, preparing for the challenges of the future. As Minister Shanmugam said in his response to Mr Murali's Motion, the key question is  when is the right time to move?"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00355,2021-11-03-T-017,355,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We could take a wait-and-see approach, given what I have said, and maintain the current system and make small adjustments at the margins, smaller tweaks; or we can make the move now, prepare ourselves for the future. We believe this will, eventually, make sense  to split the two services when the Legal Service grows further."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00356,2021-11-03-T-017,356,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I will now take Members through the key provisions of the Bills, starting with the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00357,2021-11-03-T-017,357,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Broadly, the new provisions seek to replicate the existing provisions in respect of the current LSC, with appropriate adjustments to be made where necessary in introducing the JSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00358,2021-11-03-T-017,358,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Clause 6(a), read with clause 26(1), establishes the Singapore Judicial Service. It will consist of existing LSOs holding posts in the Supreme Court or a subordinate court. All other LSOs will remain in the reconstituted Legal Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00359,2021-11-03-T-017,359,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Clause 14 inserts new articles to establish a JSC and to reconstitute the LSC. The new Articles 111B to 111I relate to the new JSC while 111J to 111Q relate to the reconstituted LSC.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00360,2021-11-03-T-017,360,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The composition of the Commissions is set out in the new Articles 111B and 111J of the Constitution.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00361,2021-11-03-T-017,361,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Each Commission will have two ex-officio members. The CJ will be the President of the JSC and the AG will be the President of the LSC. Chairman/PSC will be the ex-officio Vice-President of both Commissions.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00362,2021-11-03-T-017,362,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The key change here is the hardcoding of Chairman/PSC's role as Vice-President of both Commissions. Other than this, the remaining provisions replicate the current position in the Constitution."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00363,2021-11-03-T-017,363,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, the respective Presidents of the Commissions, Chairman/PSC and the Prime Minister may nominate up to two members, whose appointment is subject to a Presidential veto. Where any of them nominate two members, then at least one of them must be legally trained and of adequate seniority in order for both to be appointed. The existing disqualifications that you see today will continue to apply."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00364,2021-11-03-T-017,364,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Similar to today, Personal Boards (PBs) may be established to exercise certain functions of the two Commissions. However, there will be some structural changes to the PBs, which I will take Members through."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00365,2021-11-03-T-017,365,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In 2014, Members may recall that I had said PBs were restructured along Branch lines instead of by seniority. This was part of a broader shift towards specialisation, as I mentioned earlier. The two PBs that had been operating since 1995 were replaced by the Judicial Branch Special Personnel Board and the Legal Branch Special Personnel Board, which have been in operation since that time."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00366,2021-11-03-T-017,366,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These two new PBs respectively oversee most human resource functions in respect of LSOs in the Judicial Branch and LSOs in the Legal Branch, up to Superscale Grade 3. Officers at Superscale Grade 2 and above continue to be overseen by the LSC directly. The two Boards also oversee career development pathways in the Legal and Judicial tracks."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00367,2021-11-03-T-017,367,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Boards are currently constituted as such. Both are chaired by CJ, who is President of the LSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00368,2021-11-03-T-017,368,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Judicial Branch Special Personnel Board comprises CJ and three other Supreme Court Judges, and the Legal Branch Special Personnel Board comprises the CJ and senior members of the AGC, including the AG and a Supreme Court Judge."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00369,2021-11-03-T-017,369,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As part of the review, we also reviewed the appropriate structure for the PBs in the context of the changes that we seek to make for the proposed specialist model."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00370,2021-11-03-T-017,370,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With the restructuring, we have decided, following discussions with both CJ and AG, to shift to a system of formalised delegation."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00371,2021-11-03-T-017,371,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The structure of the Commissions already align authority and responsibility, reducing the need for devolution. CJ and AG, as Presidents of their respective Commissions, will be closely involved in the management of the officers in their respective Commissions. They will each be able to nominate Supreme Court Judges and Deputy Attorneys-General to the Commission if they so choose. Both offices are involved in the management of their organisations and enjoy constitutional protection for their independence."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00372,2021-11-03-T-017,372,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"A system of formalised delegation will facilitate alignment of purpose and efficient decision-making and also facilitate the division of responsibilities between the Commissions and the PBs. Post-restructuring, the sizes of the Services will also be smaller – about 200-plus officers in the Judicial Service and 500-plus for the Legal Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00373,2021-11-03-T-017,373,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Under this proposed structure, Commissions will be empowered to delegate, by way of subsidiary legislation, stipulated functions and powers to one or more of the PBs. These are to be exercised under the Commission's direction and control."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00374,2021-11-03-T-017,374,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In terms of composition of the PBs, the Articles set out a closed list of persons who may be appointed as PB members. There is also a requirement that PBs must have at least three members to ensure a diversity of voices within a PB and to bring balance to its discussion and decisions."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00375,2021-11-03-T-017,375,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Safeguards, at the same time, will be retained."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00376,2021-11-03-T-017,376,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Commissions may not delegate functions and powers relating to (a) either senior officers at or above a threshold grade; and (b) discipline and dismissal of any officers. So, both of those remain non-delegable."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00377,2021-11-03-T-017,377,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As is the case today, these matters will be decided at the Commission level because matters relating to senior officers should be decided directly by the Commissions, and functions of discipline and dismissal have serious professional implications and consequences."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00378,2021-11-03-T-017,378,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The appointment of members to any PB remains subject to the President's concurrence, as is the case today."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00379,2021-11-03-T-017,379,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Cross-Service secondments will continue to be available on application after the restructuring. I mentioned cross-Service secondments earlier in my speech. Those will continue to be available.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00380,2021-11-03-T-017,380,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To facilitate this, Articles 111F and 111N, for JSC and LSC respectively, allow them to make joint regulations to provide that their personnel management functions over officers holding prescribed posts may be exercised by the other Commission."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00381,2021-11-03-T-017,381,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Secondments will be available under a framework jointly developed by the two Commissions. Such movements will likely be subject to the prevailing rules or requirements developed by the two Commissions; the needs of the Services, obviously, given their specific manpower needs, including the availability of positions; and, necessarily, the officers' relevant experience and suitability for the job."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00382,2021-11-03-T-017,382,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, before I move on from the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, let me just briefly draw Members' attention to clauses 21 and 22 of this Bill."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00383,2021-11-03-T-017,383,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These clauses do not relate to the Commissions. These clauses amend the references in the Constitution to various statutes relating to Government borrowing. The changes are consequential to the amendments made in the Government Borrowing (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, which was just debated."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00384,2021-11-03-T-017,384,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I will now turn briefly to the Judicial Service (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, which makes consequential amendments to various other Acts."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00385,2021-11-03-T-017,385,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Bill inserts terms, such as ""Judicial Service Officer"", ""Judicial Service Commission"" or ""Singapore Judicial Service"" into the affected Acts, where appropriate, such that Acts which apply in relation to the Legal Service will also apply to the Judicial Service, and Acts that apply in relation to the LSC will also apply to the JSC and, finally, Acts that apply in relation to LSOs will also apply to JSOs."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00386,2021-11-03-T-017,386,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, in conclusion, these amendments are intended to build on the six decades of institution-building that has made the Legal Service the premier service that it is today. Sir, I beg to move."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00387,2021-11-03-T-017,387,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00388,2021-11-03-T-017,388,Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00389,2021-11-03-T-017,389,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00390,2021-11-03-T-017,390,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I stand in support of the Bills and the restructuring of our Legal Service into the separate Judicial Service Commission and Legal Service Commission.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00391,2021-11-03-T-017,391,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In July, my fellow members from the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Law, Mr Murali Pillai, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Christopher de Souza had spoken about the need to consider whether it would be feasible to set up a separate Judicial Service Commission that would be in a better position to nurture specialist judicial officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00392,2021-11-03-T-017,392,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The Government, in response, has stated that it will consider and study the proposals and, so, I am glad that these Bills have now come to be tabled before this House."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00393,2021-11-03-T-017,393,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The integrated model of our Legal Service, where officers are deployed to both judicial and legal branches, has previously met our manpower needs and helped us to build up our dispute resolution hub and status as a well-respected judiciary in the world. This is no mean feat, particularly given our small population and limited talent pool."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00394,2021-11-03-T-017,394,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"We have heard from the Minister about the great work that our Legal Service Officers have done, especially to meet our COVID-19 pandemic challenges as well."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00395,2021-11-03-T-017,395,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"But as Singapore adds to its repertoire of being the preferred international dispute hub, we need to ensure that our Judiciary and Legal Service are also well-equipped to meet any new challenges ahead."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00396,2021-11-03-T-017,396,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In the midst of fast-paced disruptions to our legal environment and profession, we are also facing a real competition with other emerging and lucrative sectors to train and retain the talent pool both in our Singapore Bar, the legal service and our Bench."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00397,2021-11-03-T-017,397,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In preparation to meet future challenges caused by these changes, we need to build a strong and deep bench, towards specialisation of emerging areas of law and expertise required in the future. However, we also need to ensure good range of exposure, especially for our younger officers. In this regard, younger does not mean in terms of age but for those less experienced."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00398,2021-11-03-T-017,398,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I do have some clarifications that I would like to cover in three parts  (a) firstly, the career in the Courts; (b) secondly, the challenges in the future; and (c) and the last part is the expertise in community-niche and culturally sensitive areas, which I will deliver in Malay."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00399,2021-11-03-T-017,399,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The first part, career in the Courts. In relation to clause 26 of the Bill, which is the transitional provision, existing officers in the legal service will be allocated or re-deployed according to the posts that they are holding. For example, existing office holders in the Supreme Courts or other subordinate Courts, like the Family Justice Courts, shall come under the newly-formed Judicial Service Commission (JSC). A ""judicial branch officer"" is defined as an existing officer who is holding a post in the Supreme Court or a Subordinate Court. My question is  what would be the definition of a ""Subordinate Court"", besides the Family Justice Courts and the State courts, what others can be taken into consideration? For example, such as Tribunals?"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00400,2021-11-03-T-017,400,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"We are also facing the challenge of a limited talent pool. Recently, three judiciary commissioners have been appointed judges in the Supreme Court. They are either Senior Counsel or senior practitioners taken from the Bar, one of whom I have appeared before, he was my arbitrator, another was an opposing counsel, the third I have worked with. As much as I am glad that we have very talented and esteemed appointments to the judiciary bench, the thinning of the talent at the Bar is a very real risk to our legal profession. We need to ensure that the deep bench in our Courts does not come at the expense of the Bar and deplete our talent pool at the Singapore Bar which is detrimental to our status of our dispute resolution hub."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00401,2021-11-03-T-017,401,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Hence, the talent for our judiciary and the Bench must be built up internally as well. I would propose that despite the separate arms being set up with the Legal Service Commission (LSC) and the JSC, that there should still be some flexibility or a fixed rotation between JSC and LSC officers in the early years of their career. This is so that they can get sufficient experience; and also be exposed to experience in the other courts. Hence, I would like to ask whether there would be flexibility to allow for transfers between both commissions to better prepare ourselves for the future needs of the Bench."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00402,2021-11-03-T-017,402,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Speaking about the future needs of the Bench, this flows into the second part of my speech on challenges in the future. The future challenges of greater cross-border litigation which not only involve complex legal or factual issues but also inevitably involves issues of conflict of laws and interface between common law and civil law systems in the various legal systems in other countries."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00403,2021-11-03-T-017,403,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"New and specialised areas of law, for example, those involving smart contracts and cryptocurrency, would also require our judges to be equipped with the necessary commercial and perhaps, private practice experience and practical know-how. These would greatly complement the technical and legal skills already on the Bench. Ultimately, a strong Bench would help to attract more disputes and bolster our dispute resolution hub status as a nation."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00404,2021-11-03-T-017,404,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"We thus need judges who understand practice and commercial realities. Thus, without the risk of thinning of the Bar, perhaps the Ministry could look into the secondment of Judicial Service officers in specific private practice areas or international postings in the early parts of their career. Of course, this is subject to issues of conflict of interest in the future and disclosure of associations in the future, once that officer leaves private practice to rejoin the Judiciary. However, such declarations are already the norm now when judges declare any potential conflict of interest prior to being docketed as a judge for a case."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00405,2021-11-03-T-017,405,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Already, we have seen in the courts how a docket system of specialist judges with the relevant practice experience and managing the case from the outset would improve the case management and our cases in litigation have now progressed efficiently and effectively. Perhaps also to complement the skillset, we can have more invited International Judges (IJs) to be part of our Judiciary and not just for cases before the Singapore International Commercial Courts (SICC), but perhaps the IJs, or International Judges, can also sit in specific High Court cases or appeals whenever necessary."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00406,2021-11-03-T-017,406,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"We not only have to broaden our talent pool to meet future challenges, we would also have to deepen our expertise in certain niche areas where perhaps there would be some religious or cultural sensitivities."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00407,2021-11-03-T-017,407,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In this regard, Mr Speaker, I will move on to the last part of my speech which I will deliver in Malay, on community, cultural and religious sensitivities."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00408,2021-11-03-T-017,408,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] To attract international funds or high net worth individuals to establish endowments or invest in Singapore, we must further strengthen Singapore's status as a leading dispute resolution hub. In addition, the Islamic financial sector has seen an increase in cases filed in courts and arbitration processes around the world, including institutions in Malaysia and the Middle East."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00409,2021-11-03-T-017,409,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"These cases require in-depth expertise and a comprehensive legal framework for handling Islamic financial dispute cases. It also requires a prudent and sensitive approach tailored to each specific region. Apart from commercial or civil cases, our courts also deal with cases involving sensitive issues that affect all walks of life in our Muslim community."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00410,2021-11-03-T-017,410,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"These include the interpretation of Syariah law issues, such as the interpretation of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA), wakaf or Islamic inheritance law (faraidh), as well as marriage or inheritance law for Muslims which are sometimes heard before the High Court."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00411,2021-11-03-T-017,411,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In my maiden speech in Parliament, I have suggested how a more comprehensive arbitration process or legal framework can be studied to deal with cases of wakaf or estate disputes in our community. This can be done by broadening the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court or deepening the specialisation of our civil courts to handle such cases."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00412,2021-11-03-T-017,412,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,All these issues affect our Muslim community.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00413,2021-11-03-T-017,413,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Furthermore, our constitution recognises the special position of the Malays and outlines the Government's commitment to protect the interests of our Malay-Muslim community and our Malay language. In terms of law, Muslim law forms part of the law of the land. Thus, our civil courts have the power to interpret Muslim law itself. Civil courts, when faced with questions of Islamic law, are not obliged to seek an opinion from MUIS."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00414,2021-11-03-T-017,414,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, I think it is timely for the Government to set up the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). It not only provides the necessary specialization, but also can balance the approach that needs to be taken in dealing with specific cases."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00415,2021-11-03-T-017,415,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"My recommendation is for suitable JSC members to be seconded or take turns handling Syariah Court or Syariah Appeal Board cases to build their understanding and knowledge. I understand that this is already happening, but perhaps the career path and development of the seconded JSC officers can be further clarified so that this rotation can attract more JSC officers. I also recommend that cross-sharing and learning be established between courts, including Syariah Court and civil court officers and all training perhaps can be conducted under the auspices of the Singapore Judicial College."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00416,2021-11-03-T-017,416,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Finally, I welcome the establishment of this Commission which can meet the needs of the community and address the challenges of more complex cases in the future for our country."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00417,2021-11-03-T-017,417,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00418,2021-11-03-T-017,418,Speaker,Mr Dennis Tan.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00419,2021-11-03-T-017,419,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me first start by declaring that I am a practising advocate and solicitor in the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Constitutional Amendment Bill and the Judicial Service (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill before us today provide for the creation of a separate Judicial Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00420,2021-11-03-T-017,420,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"The call for a separate Judicial Service is not something new at all. There has been calls for separate Judicial Services over the past 35 years and indeed, from all sides of the House. The Workers' Party former Secretary General and former Member for Anson, the late Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, called for a separate Judicial Service Commission back in 1986. Former Nominated Member of Parliament and President of the Law Society, Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair, called for it in 2004. In our manifesto for the 2011 General Election, the Workers' Party called for a separate Judicial Service. The hon Mr Murali Pillai proposed a separate Judicial Service Commission in November 2020, and again, in the Adjournment Motion in July this year together with the hon Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Christopher de Souza."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00421,2021-11-03-T-017,421,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"In November 2020, following the Ms Parti Liyani saga, my colleagues, the hon Member for Aljunied, Ms Sylvia Lim and Ms He Ting Ru, the hon Member for Seng Kang, filed a Motion named ""Justice for All"". In my speech in the ""Justice for All"" Motion, I said that it might still be worthwhile for the proposed review then, to still consider whether we should have a more specialised or dedicated Judicial track at the State Court level encompassing Magistrates and District Judges, continuing inter-services posting or rotation with other branches of the legal service, particularly with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC)."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00422,2021-11-03-T-017,422,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Today, I am heartened to see the Government taking the first step to set up a Judicial Service separate from the current legal service. The Workers' Party supports this move and indeed the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill for these changes as this will among other things, promulgate even greater judicial independence. The Bills proposed the setting up of a Judicial Service Commission (JSC) separate from the existing Legal Service Commission (LSC). Currently, the Chief Justice (CJ) is the president of the LSC and the Attorney-General (AG) and the Public Service Commission (PSC) Chairman sit on the commission together with two other members, each nominated by the Attorney-General, the PSC chairman and the Prime Minister."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00423,2021-11-03-T-017,423,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Under the new arrangements, pursuant to the Bills, the AG will take over as the president of the LSC and the PSC chairman assume the newly considered role of Vice President. The CJ shall be the President of the new JSC, while the PSC Chairman assumed the newly considered role of the Vice President, together with two other members, each nominated by the CJ, the PSC Chairman and the Prime Minister."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00424,2021-11-03-T-017,424,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I assume that the reconstituted rows in the respective commissions intend that the AG and CJ cannot be nominated by anyone to be members of the JSC and the LSC respectively. And if my assumption is wrong here, I am happy for the Minister to clarify, but this must surely be the case as this would promote independence between the two commissions. And in the case of the AG, not taking a role in a JSC, it would demonstrate greater judiciary independence."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00425,2021-11-03-T-017,425,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, the Singapore High Court has always enjoyed a good reputation in the international community for its jurisprudence and effectiveness. In particular, it has always been well-regarded by many commercial lawyers elsewhere."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00426,2021-11-03-T-017,426,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"As a shipping lawyer, I can further attest to that also, because the cross-border nature of our shipping legal work, both contentious and non-contentious, require us to work with lawyers from different maritime jurisdictions. And the issue of finding jurisdiction for both the contracts we draft and the cases we do, often has to do with finding strategic, reliable and reputable jurisdictions, which we can persuade our clients and other stakeholders to accept."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00427,2021-11-03-T-017,427,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"With the new JSC being split from the current LSC, and the more dedicated judicial track, which must surely envisage more dedicated recruitment as well as Human Resources (HR) policies, even more attention to judicial training at all levels, especially lower to mid levels, as well as a more enhanced career progression plans for all judicial officers, it is hoped that the public will be able to see better access to justice, even better quality judgments at all levels, including the various tribunals, State Courts, the High Court and the Appellate Courts above, as well as the delivery of just outcomes for all litigants."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00428,2021-11-03-T-017,428,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, I believe that our current LSC is big enough for the split to take place. I believe that a separate JSC should be given optimum autonomy to plan its recruitment in human resource development, independent of the reconstituted LSC. Having a separate JSC will, hopefully, allow it to look at recruitment, professional and continuing training and retention of personnel with a new focus as it strives to work towards building a team of officers who are specialists in being judicial officers, not merely Legal Service Officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00429,2021-11-03-T-017,429,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I hope that with the JSC, our Courts can continue to recruit and develop more specialists in different areas, be it technology, construction, finance, IP, so on and so forth. This should also not just be at the higher levels, such as in the High Court, but also in the State Courts. This will enable our Courts to maintain its high standing among judiciaries all over the world."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00430,2021-11-03-T-017,430,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, I have said in my speech during the ""Justice for All"" Motion that how an average Singaporean thinks of our judges is important. He or she must, of course, be learned in law, and also in the area of specialisation that he or she is known for, beyond pure commercial law and, particularly, in areas like criminal and family law. The ability of judges to understand and empathise with the different challenges faced by litigants of different socioeconomic backgrounds is critical. I hope and have confidence that, with a dedicated JSC, our Judiciary and judicial officers can continue to rise to these challenges."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00431,2021-11-03-T-017,431,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, next, according to The Straits Times article of 4 October on the present Bills in question, I read that secondments will be available on application to provide selected officers with experience across both services and permanent transfers may also be available subject to prevailing personnel rules."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00432,2021-11-03-T-017,432,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I would like to ask the Minister, following the changes under the present Bills, what are the new changes in respect of (a) the career development for the officers under the proposed new LSC and JSC respectively, as well as (b) the changes in respect of inter-service postings between LSC and JSC that officers can expect after the restructuring. I know the Minister touched on some aspects of this earlier, but, essentially, I would like to know how different will the career tracks be after the restructuring, and how will the changes enhance the new and separate Judicial Service. Will there, for example, be a default career progression plan, planned under each of the Services' Commission and transfers across to the other will only be catered upon request by an officer, or by the management of either services?"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00433,2021-11-03-T-017,433,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"In my speech at that ""Justice for All"" Motion, I also said a specialised Judicial Service may be preferable to the current system to provide more distance between prosecutors and those working as magistrates and judges. For example, to avoid having AGC colleagues, some of them being more senior colleagues, arguing cases before them, knowing that they may be posted back to AGC again. I had asked what safeguards will be in place to encourage reasonable distance."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00434,2021-11-03-T-017,434,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Next, I would also like to ask whether there are plans to differentiate the remuneration frameworks of the Judicial Service and the Legal Service tracks, to account for the differences in specialisation after the restructuring."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00435,2021-11-03-T-017,435,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Finally, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on how MinLaw views the current caseloads in our Courts, given our current number of judicial officers and given the pace by which the cases are being managed, and whether it thinks that the current number of judicial officers is adequate across the Courts."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00436,2021-11-03-T-017,436,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, notwithstanding my clarification, the Workers' Party will vote in support of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill and the Judicial Service (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00437,2021-11-03-T-017,437,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00438,2021-11-03-T-017,438,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, almost exactly a year ago in this House, I suggested that an independent Judicial Service Commission (JSC) be set up, amongst others, to deepen the competence of judicial officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00439,2021-11-03-T-017,439,Murali Pillai,"This suggestion to set up the JSC is not mine alone. Several hon Members made the same suggestion in this House, both before and after me, and we have just heard from the hon Member Mr Dennis Tan an account of the other Members who have spoken in this House asking for the setting up of the JSC. All of us are aligned in the request but not necessarily aligned in relation to the reasons for asking for the setting up of the JSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00440,2021-11-03-T-017,440,Murali Pillai,"The hon Minister for Law chose his words very carefully in replying to me. He said the way our service was structured ""is probably the best model for the time being""."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00441,2021-11-03-T-017,441,Murali Pillai,"As hon Members know, time is elastic. If anyone were to have asked me then as to whether the Government would set up the JSC, my instinctive reply would have been, ""Please do not hold your breath!"""
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00442,2021-11-03-T-017,442,Murali Pillai,"Then, in July this year, hon Members Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Lim Biow Chuan joined me in an Adjournment Motion to call on the Government to study the feasibility to set up a separate and independent JSC to allow for deeper specialisation and ensure that the Judiciary is properly positioned for the challenges of the future."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00443,2021-11-03-T-017,443,Murali Pillai,The hon Minister for Law agreed broadly with the points we made and pithily put it as an issue of timing. The Second Minister for Law recounted this just earlier today as well.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00444,2021-11-03-T-017,444,Murali Pillai,"Should we retain the current structure and make incremental changes as we go along, or should we split the services now to put our country on a better footing for the future?"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00445,2021-11-03-T-017,445,Murali Pillai,"If the same person were to have repeated the question on whether the split would have happened after the Adjournment Motion, my response would likely be that I am hopeful it will happen sooner rather than later."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00446,2021-11-03-T-017,446,Murali Pillai,"As it turned out, just three months later, we are now considering these amendments to the Constitution to create a separate JSC out of the current LSC. I am really glad to note from the hon Member Mr Dennis Tan's speech that it will enjoy bipartisan support as well. If these amendments are passed, the plan is to put them into effect in January 2022."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00447,2021-11-03-T-017,447,Murali Pillai,I am highlighting this chronology as it is clear to me that the Government was already considering the merits of these changes for a while and decided that now is the time to make these changes in the interest of securing of country's future.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00448,2021-11-03-T-017,448,Murali Pillai,"The Government's approach brings to my mind what Prime Minister Lee stated during his National Day Rally speech in 2016. He asked, and I quote, ""whether things could get better for Singapore after SG50. Can the best be yet to come? The answer was a resounding ""yes!"""
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00449,2021-11-03-T-017,449,Murali Pillai,"He went on to state that one thing we need, as a country, to ensure this is to be, and I quote, ""blessed with a divine discontent, always not quite satisfied with what we have, always driven to do better"". These amendments we are considering reflect the spirit of ""divine discontent"" and ""drive to do better""."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00450,2021-11-03-T-017,450,Murali Pillai,It is also in keeping with the Motion on Singapore's Justice System passed in Parliament in November 2020 in which we affirmed the Government's continuous efforts to build a fair and just society.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00451,2021-11-03-T-017,451,Murali Pillai,"Perhaps, this explains why Singapore did well in the Pew Research Centre Report dated 21 October 2021 which conducted research in 17 advanced economies, including Singapore, to identify whether citizens in these economies want significant changes to their political system."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00452,2021-11-03-T-017,452,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to flash a slide of the table from the report on the screen, please?"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00453,2021-11-03-T-017,453,Speaker,Please do. [
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00454,2021-11-03-T-017,454,Murali Pillai,"Obliged. Yes. Thankfully, it is clearer. But now it is not."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00455,2021-11-03-T-017,455,Speaker,We should use slides that we can read.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00456,2021-11-03-T-017,456,Murali Pillai,"The chart is entitled ""Those who want changes to their political system are not confident political system can be changed"". So, you do not want to be high up in the chart from the Pew Research Center that I am showing."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00457,2021-11-03-T-017,457,Murali Pillai,"Italy is ranked at the top, meaning, amongst the 17 economies, its people are the least satisfied."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00458,2021-11-03-T-017,458,Murali Pillai,"Singapore is right below, meaning her people are the most satisfied."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00459,2021-11-03-T-017,459,Murali Pillai,"It is stated in the report that in every economy, except Singapore, there are larger shares of the public who want political reform but lack the confidence that reform can happen effectively as compared to those who are confident that change can occur."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00460,2021-11-03-T-017,460,Murali Pillai,"Eighty-two percent of Singaporeans said that they are satisfied with the way democracy is working here, compared to an overall median of 57%. A key feature of our democracy is that real action is taken, to make changes essential to securing our future and keeping all of us united in purpose."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00461,2021-11-03-T-017,461,Murali Pillai,"The significance of setting up a separate and independent JSC should not be lost on anyone in this House. Just last month, when this House was considering the FICA Bill, there were insinuations in some quarters, particularly outside this House, that the Government is bent on making itself more powerful to suppress legitimate free speech and expression amongst our people."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00462,2021-11-03-T-017,462,Murali Pillai,"Since then, this Government has repealed the Sedition Act, which was introduced during the colonial times to rein in discontent against the Government and it is now moving these Constitutional amendments which will enjoy bipartisan support to create an independent JSC to oversee judicial service officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00463,2021-11-03-T-017,463,Murali Pillai,"These are not the acts of a power-hungry government, hell-bent on entrenching itself and ignoring the wishes of the people. Fair-minded people decide not based on empty words, but on real action."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00464,2021-11-03-T-017,464,Murali Pillai,The razor-sharp focus of our Government is on securing our people’s future against the backdrop of an ever more challenging global landscape.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00465,2021-11-03-T-017,465,Murali Pillai,"For the remainder of my speech, I wish to focus on the proposed reconstituted LSC. In my speech during the Adjournment Motion, I had spoken about the indelible contributions of the current LSC, using the integrated model since 1959, for which, as a nation, we owe much thanks. I have also spoken about the highly-respected judicial system that we have in Singapore and how the JSC will serve to strengthen it even more under the proposed system."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00466,2021-11-03-T-017,466,Murali Pillai,"Let me start off by acknowledging the quality of the officers in the Legal Branch of the LSC, past and present."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00467,2021-11-03-T-017,467,Murali Pillai,"To illustrate this point, I need only ask hon Members, as the hon Second Minister for Law did just a few minutes ago, to recount their own legislative experience in this House."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00468,2021-11-03-T-017,468,Murali Pillai,"In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, we had to pass 12 wide-ranging Bills. Seven of these bills were urgent Bills which included the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill and its three subsequent amendment Bills, Supply Bills, Bills providing for Parliamentary elections and marriage solemnisation during COVID-19. Two hundred and twenty-seven pieces of COVID-19-related subsidiary legislation were also published."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00469,2021-11-03-T-017,469,Murali Pillai,"We were able to do this because of, amongst others, a top-rate team in the legislative division of the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC). They had to be creative but meticulous, be daring but keep an eye for the minutiae of details. And all is done, quoting the hon Second Minister for Law, at ""breakneck speed""."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00470,2021-11-03-T-017,470,Murali Pillai,"I still recall the speech of the hon Minister for Law when he expressed his pride and appreciation for the work done by officers involved during the passing of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill. Several hon Members, including myself, joined him to express our appreciation."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00471,2021-11-03-T-017,471,Murali Pillai,"This speaks of the quality and dedication of the officers we have in the legislative division headed by the hon Deputy Solicitor-General, Mrs Owi Beng Ki."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00472,2021-11-03-T-017,472,Murali Pillai,"The Legal Branch is replete with great examples of dedicated officers, past and present, with a strong sense of duty. I would like to mention some of them whom I have had the privilege of knowing."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00473,2021-11-03-T-017,473,Murali Pillai,"The late Mr K S Rajah SC. He served in the Legal Service from 1963 to 1985. This included a stint as the longest-serving Director of the Legal Aid Bureau, which allows people of limited means with important access to civil and family justice."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00474,2021-11-03-T-017,474,Murali Pillai,"The late Mr S Tiwari, who was in the Legal Service for 36 years from 1971 to 2007 when he retired. During his career, he headed MINDEF's Legal Department and AGC's Civil Division and later, its International Affairs Division. He was involved in numerous international negotiations representing Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00475,2021-11-03-T-017,475,Murali Pillai,"Mr Daren Tang, who is currently the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). In fact, he is the first Singaporean to lead a UN Agency. The hon Minister Mr Edwin Tong described his appointment as, and I quote, ""a momentous occasion for Singapore"". Prior to that, he was the Chief Executive of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and held several positions in AGC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00476,2021-11-03-T-017,476,Murali Pillai,"Mr Mohamed Faizal Senior Counsel, Senior State Counsel of the Crime Division of AGC – he is an excellent example of how one mixes heavy duty responsibilities with regular volunteer work for our community. For his contributions to the legal profession and the community, he was awarded the Berita Harian Anugerah Jauhari 2020 award. He was also inducted as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in 2016."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00477,2021-11-03-T-017,477,Murali Pillai,"I make these references for a purpose. We must ensure that with the split of the current LSC into a JSC and the reconstituted LSC, the reconstituted LSC should continue to attract and retain its fair share of top talent with the right set of values."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00478,2021-11-03-T-017,478,Murali Pillai,The Legal Service Officers of the Legal Branch perform vital roles in providing legal advice to the Government and playing their role in the administration of justice and helping to uphold of the rule of law in Singapore.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00479,2021-11-03-T-017,479,Murali Pillai,"With the reconstituted LSC, there is an opportunity to hasten the pace of specialisation of the LSOs to keep up with the demands of their respective jobs and the ever-rising expectations of Singaporeans. May I ask the hon Minister whether plans have been made to deal with this issue? If so, I would be grateful for an outline of the efforts that will be expended on this front."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00480,2021-11-03-T-017,480,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, laws are unwieldy creatures. The text of the laws passed can be so turgid and formal such that many people cannot help but describe it as ""gobbledegook"". But they are also such powerful forces. During the pandemic, for example, these laws make sure that workers get paid, our rents reduced and that the promises businesses made to one another can be modified easily without breaking trust. And all these, in an orderly, legitimate and predictable manner."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00481,2021-11-03-T-017,481,Murali Pillai,"This could not have been done without the best legal minds at work in the public sector. This restructuring is needed, but we must do it with care. The reconstituted LSC must stand shoulder to shoulder with the JSC as twin pillars in attracting and developing the best human resource talent in the public legal sector that will continue to meet the high expectations of Singaporeans well into the future."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00482,2021-11-03-T-017,482,Murali Pillai,"This will allow us to pursue our democratic dream, partnered with divine discontent, not mere dissatisfaction with the way things are, but the power to change them to the way they should be. I support the Bill."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00483,2021-11-03-T-017,483,Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.55 pm.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00484,2021-11-03-T-017,484,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00485,2021-11-03-T-017,485,Speaker,at 4.32 pm until 4.55 pm.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00486,2021-11-03-T-017,486,Speaker,Sitting resumed at 4.55 pm.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00487,2021-11-03-T-017,487,Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00488,2021-11-03-T-017,488,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, the Bill proposes to establish a Judicial Service Commission (JSC), separate from the Legal Service Commission (LSC). The restructuring will allow both the LSC and JSC to benefit from greater specialisation and flexibility. This is needed to tackle the increasing complexity of the legal landscape."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00489,2021-11-03-T-017,489,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Our legal system and judiciary are greatly respected for impartially and efficiently dispensing justice. The amendments will help us to maintain the good standing of our legal system.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00490,2021-11-03-T-017,490,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have three points of clarification to make.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00491,2021-11-03-T-017,491,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My first point is on the independence of the LSC, the Public Service Commission (PSC) and the JSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00492,2021-11-03-T-017,492,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The public place great trust in our institutions. Results released in March this year from an IPS study showed that 81% of the public had a great deal or quite a lot of trust in the Government; 82% said this of the Courts, and 80% said this of the Civil Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00493,2021-11-03-T-017,493,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In the 2020 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index measuring the rule of law in countries, Singapore was placed 12 out of 128 countries. The Rule of Law Index looks at, among other things, accountability and open government."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00494,2021-11-03-T-017,494,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In the 2019 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, Singapore was ranked 14 out of 141 countries for judicial independence."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00495,2021-11-03-T-017,495,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,It is very commendable that we have such high levels of trust locally and internationally in our public institutions. We should work hard to maintain this.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00496,2021-11-03-T-017,496,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My clarification is on how we can safeguard the good reputation of our public institutions by ensuring independence of the JSC, LSC and PSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00497,2021-11-03-T-017,497,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"There are some concerns that the proposed Articles may mean some overlap among the Commissions for the LSC, PSC and JSC. For example, the Chairman of the PSC will be the Vice-President of both the LSC and JSC. The PSC will also advise the President on the appointment of up to two members each on the LSC and JSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00498,2021-11-03-T-017,498,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"It would be good if the Minister can share some safeguards in place to ensure the public can continue to have high confidence in the independence of the LSC, JSC and PSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00499,2021-11-03-T-017,499,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second point is on recruiting a wider range of talents from beyond the existing legal service into the JSC.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00500,2021-11-03-T-017,500,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In July this year, my colleague Mr Murali Pillai delivered an Adjournment Motion with Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Lim Biow Chuan on the feasibility of setting up the JSC for judicial officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00501,2021-11-03-T-017,501,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In his Motion speech, Mr Murali spoke about the flexibility the JSC may have in recruiting a wider range of talent. He gave the example of how someone with experience in programming who is taught law may be able to navigate the technical facts of a case much better than a legally-trained Judge. I echo these sentiments."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00502,2021-11-03-T-017,502,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Additionally, the three Members spoke on the benefits of the movement of judicial officers and legal service officers across judicial and legal service branches. Such rotations are beneficial for the officers and the respective branches. That said, I think we can all agree that it is important for the judicial service to be staffed by officers from a diversity of backgrounds beyond the legal service. Recruiting talent from diverse backgrounds will help with responding to increasingly complex and specialised cases before the Courts and also for maintaining trust in the judiciary’s independence."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00503,2021-11-03-T-017,503,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Can the Minister share the plans to diversify the talent pool of judicial officers within the JSC?
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00504,2021-11-03-T-017,504,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Lastly, under the new Article 111D, an appointed member to the JSC may hold office of three to five years and is eligible for reappointment. Under the new Article 111L, an appointed member to the LSC may hold office of three to five years and is also eligible for reappointment."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00505,2021-11-03-T-017,505,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Both Articles do not set out any limits for such reappointment. Limits on reappointment are not uncommon in private and public institutions. Such limits steer institutions towards leadership renewal and organisational changes.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00506,2021-11-03-T-017,506,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Can the Minister confirm whether there are limits on the reappointment of any member to the LSC and JSC? If not, can the Minister share the rationale for not limiting the number of reappointments that a member can hold in both the LSC and JSC?"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00507,2021-11-03-T-017,507,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of both Bills."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00508,2021-11-03-T-017,508,Speaker,Mr Lim Biow Chuan.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00509,2021-11-03-T-017,509,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I declare my interest in speaking on this Bill as a practising lawyer."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00510,2021-11-03-T-017,510,Lim Biow Chuan,"In July this year, my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Murali Pillai, filed an Adjournment Motion on the “Feasibility of Setting up a Judicial Service Commission for Judicial Officers”. I spoke in support of the Motion as I am of the view that it is in the interest of our legal system that we have judicial officers who can be equipped to serve in the various specialised Courts and to meet the challenges of the future. I am grateful that MinLaw supports this need to carry out structural changes to the Legal Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00511,2021-11-03-T-017,511,Lim Biow Chuan,"The Judiciary is one of the three Organs of State. It plays an integral part in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is accessible to all the citizens of Singapore. For that reason, it is important that the Government reviews the structure of the Legal Service to ensure that both judicial officers and Legal Service officers are adequately prepared for the future."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00512,2021-11-03-T-017,512,Lim Biow Chuan,"In the 2020 Annual Report of the Legal Service Commission, it was reported that there are 806 Legal Service Officers (LSOs) in service as at 31 December 2020. Of these 806 LSOs, 224 were in the judicial branch and 582 in the legal branch. The judicial branch serves the Supreme Court, the State Court and the Family Justice Courts. The legal branch serves the AGC and the legal service departments in various Ministries and Statutory Boards. As an example, the 582 LSOs serve in Government agencies other than AGC, like they serve in ACRA, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), EDB, Health Service Authority (HSA), IMDA, IPOS, IRAS, Office of Public Guardian (OPG), LTA, SLA, NEA, SMC, MUIS and so on. So, it is really a wide scope for these LSOs."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00513,2021-11-03-T-017,513,Lim Biow Chuan,"Based on the Singapore Courts Annual Report 2020, the caseload of the State Courts was a total of 187,016 cases in 2020. Out of these 187,016 cases, 143,728 are classified as criminal cases, 31,189 are classified as civil cases and there are 12,099 community and tribunal-related cases. The caseload for the State Courts for 2019 was higher at 249,954 cases. That is almost a quarter million. The caseload for 2018 was even higher at 359,064 cases."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00514,2021-11-03-T-017,514,Lim Biow Chuan,"Then we go on to the Family Justice Courts. The caseload is 25,633 cases for 2020 and 27,953 cases for 2019. If you add the total caseloads of the State Courts, the Family Justice Courts and the work in the Supreme Court, many of us will agree that the 224 judicial officers, even with support staff, will be grossly overstretched."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00515,2021-11-03-T-017,515,Lim Biow Chuan,"The Singapore Courts Annual Report also gave examples of significant cases handled by the Courts. There was a case about terrorism financing, a case about defamatory comments made on social media against an F&B company; there are cases about protection to be given to litigants under the Prevention of Harassment Act and even a case about euthanasia of a dog."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00516,2021-11-03-T-017,516,Lim Biow Chuan,"In a 2020 case involving cryptocurrency, the Court had to make a decision involving cryptocurrency trades and the implications of smart contracts and artificial intelligence. In the not too far future, judges may be called upon to decide who is at fault if there are accidents involving driverless cars."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00517,2021-11-03-T-017,517,Lim Biow Chuan,"Another example of the evolving law is in the area of family law. In the past, lawyers acting for parties who have filed for divorce would work towards getting the best resolution for their clients. And that is the nature of an adversarial system. Today, lawyers and judges alike, would have to adjust to this concept of therapeutic justice in family disputes."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00518,2021-11-03-T-017,518,Lim Biow Chuan,"Based on the volume of cases handled by the State Courts and Family Justice Courts and the increasing complexity of cases, I would submit that it is timely for us to review the need for our judicial officers to have greater specialisation so as to gain greater depth of knowledge about the latest developments in the law."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00519,2021-11-03-T-017,519,Lim Biow Chuan,"There has always been a high regard for our judicial system. The Singapore judiciary and our legal system have always been recognised as among the best in the world. Within Singapore, a recent survey by the Institute of Policy Studies shows that 82% of the respondents had either a great deal or quite a lot of trust in our Courts."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00520,2021-11-03-T-017,520,Lim Biow Chuan,"Minister Indranee Rajah had said in her 2014 speech on the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill, “the public reposes a great deal of trust and confidence in the Subordinate Courts – and, indeed, our Judiciary generally. We trust them to apply the law impartially, uphold our laws and dispense justice fairly.”"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00521,2021-11-03-T-017,521,Lim Biow Chuan,Our Chief Justice said recently society’s regard for and trust in the Courts are “extremely precious”.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00522,2021-11-03-T-017,522,Lim Biow Chuan,"For that reason, Sir, I submit that we need to invest heavily in our legal officers serving both in the Judiciary as well as in the Legal Service so that we can continue to earn and maintain the trust of the people in our legal system. Having a separate Judicial Service Commission and a Legal Service Commission is just a step towards recognising the challenges facing our LSOs and allow them to explore greater specialisation and more equipped for the future. Having a personnel board for each commission also ensures that we continue to attract and retain talent to serve in the legal and judicial services."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00523,2021-11-03-T-017,523,Lim Biow Chuan,"Our judicial officers need more specialised knowledge to better grasp the complex laws and facts; they also need equipping to understand the different emotions of the litigant. And that is not an easy task for Judicial officers. I quote Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice in the UK, in a speech which he made in October 2008. He said, “Many qualities are required of a judge… He or she must, of course, know the law, and know how to apply it, but the judge must always be wise to the ways of the world. The judge must have the ability to make a decision."""
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00524,2021-11-03-T-017,524,Lim Biow Chuan,"""Decisions can be profoundly unpleasant. For example, to say to a mother that her children would be taken away from her, or to say to an individual that he is going to prison for the rest of his life."""
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00525,2021-11-03-T-017,525,Lim Biow Chuan,"""Judges must have moral courage. It is an important judicial attribute to make decisions that will be unpopular with the politicians or the media and the public, and, indeed, perhaps, most importantly of all, to defend the right to equal treatment before the law, of those who are unpopular at any given time.”"
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00526,2021-11-03-T-017,526,Lim Biow Chuan,"So, even the person who may be very unpopular or condemned by social media or members of the public, it is the job of a judge to ensure that this person is given the right to equal treatment before the law, even if they are unpopular at any point of time. These are wise words because judicial officers would need to deal firmly with recalcitrant offenders and yet show compassion to an accused person who may have made a mistake due to poor judgement or reacted badly due to a breakdown in emotions. Judicial officers in the Family Justice Courts would have to deal with litigants sensitively, especially where there are young children involved."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00527,2021-11-03-T-017,527,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, the proposed amendments to the Constitution did not specifically state whether LSOs can still be transferred between the judicial divisions or the legal service division. However, I am glad to hear the Minister's confirmation that cross-service secondments will continue to be available on application where useful, to provide selected officers with cross-service experience."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00528,2021-11-03-T-017,528,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I think it is important that legal officers can still be allowed to ask for cross-service postings so as to deepen their knowledge of the work that they do. For example, if a judicial officer in the Family Court wishes to seek a posting to MSF to better understand how family disputes can be resolved, surely that kind of cross-postings should be encouraged. That judicial officer would then be armed with practical life skills that would make him or her a better judge in the Family Justice Courts. Similarly, a legal officer who had served as a prosecutor or a lawyer who had previously worked as a litigation lawyer is better placed to understand the adversarial nature of disputes. I would also submit that all our judicial officers must have some wide exposure to community work and more depth of experience in life before being appointed as judicial officers. Even as we position our legal service and judicial service officers as what former Chief Justice, the late Mr Yong Pung How, described as the “premier service” in the public sector, I hope that we also remind our judicial officers on the need to remain humble as they serve the wider society in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00529,2021-11-03-T-017,529,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I urge the JSC to encourage their judicial officers to widen their life skills in different areas, including being humble, being patient with others, handling nervous litigants or witnesses and showing empathy and compassion wherever needed. Sir, I support the Bill."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00530,2021-11-03-T-017,530,Speaker,Mr Vikram Nair.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00531,2021-11-03-T-017,531,Vikram Nair,"Mr Speaker, like most of the others before me, I declare my interest as a practicing lawyer."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00532,2021-11-03-T-017,532,Vikram Nair,"I speak in support of both Bills. These Bills involve the setting up of a Judicial Services Commission in Singapore which will oversee the judicial officers in both the State Courts and the Supreme Court. The Commission’s role includes determining the appointment, confirmation, placement on permanent establishment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of judicial officers. So, essentially, this controls the personnel function."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00533,2021-11-03-T-017,533,Vikram Nair,"These functions were previously carried out by the Legal Services Commission, which oversaw all legal officers in the Public Service, including both the judicial services, those in the Attorney-General’s Chambers and those in other public agencies. The Legal Services Commission will remain, but its remit will no longer cover judicial officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00534,2021-11-03-T-017,534,Vikram Nair,"Related to these changes, the Chief Justice, who was previously President of the Legal Services Commission, will now be President of the Judicial Services Commission, while the Attorney-General will now be President of the Legal Services Commission."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00535,2021-11-03-T-017,535,Vikram Nair,"The rationale for such changes is that it allows specialisation in each of the services and for the senior officers in each branch to properly evaluate and appoint the officers to that branch. This is obviously quite sensible. There is also an argument that this provides a cleaner separation of powers, with judicial officers cleanly separated from those performing other functions, such as in public prosecution. This separation of functions exists in many countries, including many in the Commonwealth."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00536,2021-11-03-T-017,536,Vikram Nair,"Having said that, this matter has been raised before, including in this House, and in the past, we had always believed that having a single Legal Services Commission had worked well for Singapore and had certain advantages. This included that officers could be rotated across functions and to develop broader experiences."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00537,2021-11-03-T-017,537,Vikram Nair,"Judicial officers, for example, could benefit from having had stints as counsel, such as public prosecutors. Similarly, those acting as public prosecutors may also benefit from having spent time as registrars, or even as district judges, as they will see matters from the perspective of the bench. There is also a perception that the judicial service would be the more desired branch and, in the past, those in other parts of the legal service may aspire to be judicial officers if they performed well."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00538,2021-11-03-T-017,538,Vikram Nair,"So, while I note that the separation of functions does not prevent cross-posting of officers, and the Minister in his introductory statement has stated secondments will be available, will such cross-postings be more difficult, now that there are different commissions governing both? Is there also a risk that if an officer stays only in one branch of the service, they may not get the broader perspective they used to be able to get in the past that will help them perform their functions better? Does this also mean that legal careers will be set in stone, depending on which side of the branch they start in? Clarifications notwithstanding, I support both Bills."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00539,2021-11-03-T-017,539,Speaker,Mr Edwin Tong.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00540,2021-11-03-T-017,540,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, I thank Members who spoke in support of the Bill from both sides of the House."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00541,2021-11-03-T-017,541,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me quickly and directly address the questions raised.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00542,2021-11-03-T-017,542,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about the definition of “subordinate court” as used in clause 26 of the Bill. As set out in clause 26, on the appointed date, the existing Judicial Branch officers will be assigned to the Judicial Service, and all other Legal Service officers will remain in the reconstituted Legal Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00543,2021-11-03-T-017,543,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"A Judicial Branch officer is defined as an officer holding a post in the Supreme Court or a subordinate court immediately before the date of the commencement of the Act. To avoid doubt, the LSC Secretariat will be notifying the individual officers of the Service that they have been assigned to."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00544,2021-11-03-T-017,544,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The term ""subordinate court"" as used in clause 26 of the Bill has the same meaning as that in Article 93 of the Constitution. So, it includes the State Courts, the Family Courts and the Youth Courts."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00545,2021-11-03-T-017,545,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng asked about the safeguards for judicial independence, notwithstanding the ""overlaps"" in the composition of the JSC, LSC and PSC. I think he refers to the overlap in question, which is the Chairman of PSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00546,2021-11-03-T-017,546,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On Chairman/PSC's presence on both the JSC and LSC, Mr Louis Ng might be interested to know that, in fact, the 1959 Constitution, which I referred to earlier and which first established the LSC, already provided for the Chairman of PSC to be an ex-officio member of the LSC and that, has since, remained unchanged. So, we are simply using that and Chairman/PSC remains now on both of the two Commissions, post-split."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00547,2021-11-03-T-017,547,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, there is a good reason for this. It has allowed the LSC to draw from the best practices, particularly from a human resource perspective, of the PSC, while the Commissions remain separate and independent. So, this will continue after the restructuring. The JSC and the LSC can draw on Chairman/PSC's experience and expertise whilst the various Commissions remain separate and independent."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00548,2021-11-03-T-017,548,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There is no question of Chairman/PSC's ability to act independently. He is himself appointed by the President in her discretion, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, and there are constitutional safeguards, which I have outlined earlier, to secure his independence."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00549,2021-11-03-T-017,549,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng also mentioned that Chairman/PSC nominates up to two members each on the JSC and the LSC. Again, as I have said in my opening speech, this is something that has already been in place since the 1959 Constitution although, prior to 2007, Chairman/PSC could nominate two members of the PSC directly to the LSC, whereas, today, Chairman/PSC advises the President on the appointment of up to two members and the President has the discretion to veto such nominations. That structure remains today in the Bill. In fact, just to be complete, this is on the same footing as the Chief Justice and the Prime Minister. Their nominees are also subject to the President's veto."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00550,2021-11-03-T-017,550,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Even if, for the sake of argument, one were to accept that there is some risk that Chairman/PSC would not act independently, this concern is premised on the notion that Chairman/PSC's nominees will somehow be unable to act independently as well. But Mr Louis Ng will be assured to know that the appointments of both JSC and LSC members, including the Chairman of PSC's nominees, will be made by the President, acting in her discretion. She discharges her duties with a direct mandate from the electorate."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00551,2021-11-03-T-017,551,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The eligibility criteria for JSC and LSC members are also set out in the Constitution and designed to make sure that members have no formal political links. Just for Members' information, Article 111K sets out the qualifications, and 111L sets out the disqualifications."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00552,2021-11-03-T-017,552,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, all JSC and LSC members must take an oath of office and it will be an offence for any member to disclose any information in connection with any matter referred to the Commission."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00553,2021-11-03-T-017,553,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng asked if there are limits on the reappointment of JSC and LSC members and, if not, the reasons for not limiting the number of reappointments that a member can hold on the JSC and LSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00554,2021-11-03-T-017,554,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The short answer to Mr Louis Ng is no. There are no limits on the reappointment of JSC and LSC members. Whilst we understand Mr Louis Ng's concerns about leadership renewal and organisational change, we must also, at the same time, be realistic about the pool of candidates that are suitable and also willing to serve on these Commissions."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00555,2021-11-03-T-017,555,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Candidates must be suitably qualified – I set out earlier the Articles that prescribe the criteria – and sufficiently senior, with experience, and for those from the private sector especially, must be willing to devote time and energy to Public Service."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00556,2021-11-03-T-017,556,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We want the best people to sit on both Commissions. Given our small size, this pool is not large. It is not feasible to impose strict limits on reappointments, which would not lead to the best results for both Commissions."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00557,2021-11-03-T-017,557,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, let me touch on secondments and transfers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00558,2021-11-03-T-017,558,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Both Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Vikram Nair spoke on the benefits of secondments in providing breadth of exposure for officers. Mr Lim asked for confirmation that such secondments would continue. Mr Nair asked if secondments would be more difficult after the restructuring since there are different Commissions governing the officers and whether there is a risk that if an officer remains in one Branch, they would not get a broader perspective that will help them to perform their functions better."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00559,2021-11-03-T-017,559,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In the same vein, Mr Zhulkarnain made a number of proposals on secondments for exposure. Mr Zhulkarnain, in particular, asked if permanent transfers will be available where necessary to meet manpower needs and if the possibility for suitable Judicial Officers (JOs) to be seconded to the Syariah Court can be retained."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00560,2021-11-03-T-017,560,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I welcome Mr Lim's, Mr Nair's and Mr Zhulkarnain's points. The goal of the restructuring is to better support the training and development of officers in the Judicial Service and the Legal Service. This overall objective has not changed. We want to provide the best development opportunities for officers."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00561,2021-11-03-T-017,561,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I mentioned in my opening speech, both the Judicial and Legal Branches have now matured to a state where there are diverse opportunities within each Branch – not just across but within each Branch – for exposure."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00562,2021-11-03-T-017,562,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Nevertheless, as I have mentioned earlier, secondments will continue to be made available under a framework to be discussed and agreed upon by both Commissions."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00563,2021-11-03-T-017,563,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With the restructuring, I expect that the two Commissions will explore even more innovative ways of enhancing the development of both Legal and Judicial Service Officers. In this regard, I am sure that the Commissions will take very seriously the various proposals and suggestions that Members have put forward."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00564,2021-11-03-T-017,564,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Pillai and Mr Ng touched on talent attraction and talent diversification in their speeches respectively.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00565,2021-11-03-T-017,565,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Pillai asked how the reconstituted LSC plans to attract and retain its fair share of top talent with the right set of values after restructuring. Those are perennial problems, not just today, previously but also in the private sector."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00566,2021-11-03-T-017,566,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Louis Ng queried if there are plans to diversify the talent pool of judicial officers within the JSC.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00567,2021-11-03-T-017,567,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, let me thank Mr Pillai's impassioned speech and his recognition of the impactful work undertaken by the LSOs in the past year and a half, at least. It has been a challenging period – as Mr Pillai illustrated with various examples – but the officers, I think we can agree, have delivered far beyond expectations."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00568,2021-11-03-T-017,568,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The plans going forward are matters for the new Commissions when they are constituted. That is precisely why they are set up with the respective Personnel Boards. Nevertheless, I am sure that both the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, as the future Presidents of the two Commissions, share Mr Pillai's concerns that both their Services must continue to attract the right legal talent with a heart for service and a care for Singapore in their respective domains."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00569,2021-11-03-T-017,569,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I think Mr Dennis Tan also raised this point and what I have just said will also answer the query he had raised. I should also add to Mr Tan's question that the intent is not to have the Chief Justice nominated to the LSC or for the Attorney-General to be nominated to the JSC. That would not be compatible with the spirit of the amendments that we are proposing.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00570,2021-11-03-T-017,570,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The issue of talent diversification – I have to come back to this point that I think Mr Louis Ng also raised – and, more importantly, ensuring that we have the right people with the relevant skillsets and also temperament for the Bench will, undoubtedly, be on the forefront of the minds of the JSC."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00571,2021-11-03-T-017,571,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I had earlier mentioned in my speech how both the Judicial and Legal Branches have been taking measures to deepen specialisation within their own skillsets. They will continue to build on these efforts after the restructuring.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00572,2021-11-03-T-017,572,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With the restructuring, the two Commissions will have the flexibility to also develop their own unique value proposition in terms of breadth of exposure for their officers, talent development, opportunities for career progression, recruitment and so on. As I have said earlier, the competition is not just within the Service. It is how do we attract the best talent, given that we have developed the legal industry, the legal landscape in Singapore to an extent where the top talent does exist in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00573,2021-11-03-T-017,573,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,But I am confident that the two Commissions will be able to chart the way forward for the respective Services as we enter this next stage of institution-building.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00574,2021-11-03-T-017,574,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On this note, Mr Dennis Tan asked about caseloads. Mr Lim Biow Chuan also cited some figures."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00575,2021-11-03-T-017,575,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The cases are getting more complex; not just more but also more complicated. But the officers have worked very hard. And just to give Members a sense, between 2018 and 2020, the State Courts and Family Justice Courts collectively dealt with an average caseload of more than 292,000 cases each year. What is also commendable is that, in these three years at least, the State Courts have consistently achieved a total case clearance rate of more than 100% each year, which means that the number of cases they clear exceeds the number of new cases that are filed each year. So, they are progressively clearing a backlog and making sure that cases are disposed of more expeditiously."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00576,2021-11-03-T-017,576,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I cannot speak for their manpower needs moving forward but, certainly, this demonstrates that officers have been working hard to ensure that justice is not just served correctly but served expeditiously as well."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00577,2021-11-03-T-017,577,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me touch on some questions raised by Members on the opportunities for cross-learning and collaboration.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00578,2021-11-03-T-017,578,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Zhulkarnain mentioned ensuring opportunities for cross-learning between the two Services and that the Singapore Judicial College could be involved. We thank him for these suggestions. We agree that the Services must continue sharing knowledge and best practices even after the restructuring, and we will pass this feedback on to the two Commissions."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00579,2021-11-03-T-017,579,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Last couple of queries.
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00580,2021-11-03-T-017,580,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Dennis Tan asked about career development after the split of the two Commissions. The Commissions will study and consider. But I can say to Mr Tan that their focus will be what works best for Singapore, how best to attract and retain talent and how best to develop their respective officers, as I have mentioned earlier."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00581,2021-11-03-T-017,581,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the secondments. I mentioned that in the two Articles 111F and 111N., and the framework here is to jointly develop a framework for cross-seondings secondments."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00582,2021-11-03-T-017,582,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Members might also wish to know that after the Adjournment Motion by Mr Pillai, there were townhalls held by the Working Group. There was a workgroup that was set up. There were at least five townhalls, significant engagement with Legal Service Officers, and they expressed a desire for secondments to continue; to continue to allow them to be seconded so that they can, as Mr Lim puts it, gain a far wider breadth of experience so that this will come to bear positively in the discharge of their services."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00583,2021-11-03-T-017,583,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I believe this brings me to the end of the responses to the various questions that are raised. I have touched on, I think, almost all of the queries. With that, Sir, I beg to move."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00584,2021-11-03-T-017,584,Speaker,"Clarifications, please. Mr Murali Pillai."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00585,2021-11-03-T-017,585,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a clarification on my speech delivered earlier."
2021-11-03-T-017-S-00586,2021-11-03-T-017,586,Murali Pillai,"I had raised attention to the good work of the Legislation Division of the Attorney-General's Chambers, headed by Mrs Owi, the Deputy Solicitor-General. I would like to mention that she had handed the baton to Ms Jeanne Lee, the Chief Legislative Counsel and, under Ms Lee's stewardship, the division continues to deliver high standards. It is my hope that this service of excellence will reach even greater heights under the reconstituted LSC. Thank you, Sir."

2021-11-03-T-020-S-00620,2021-11-03-T-020,620,Speaker,Ms Tin Pei Ling.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00621,2021-11-03-T-020,621,Tin Pei Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the role of migrant domestic workers (MDWs) in Singapore’s caregiving landscape. My speech will set the context and put forth recommendations for the Ministry’s consideration. Thereafter, hon Member Nadia Abdul Samdin will build on further."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00622,2021-11-03-T-020,622,Tin Pei Ling,"First, on recognising the role of MDWs in caregiving."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00623,2021-11-03-T-020,623,Tin Pei Ling,Singapore’s society structure has changed as we progress.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00624,2021-11-03-T-020,624,Tin Pei Ling,"Firstly, Singapore is ageing – a fact well emphasised in recent years. One in five Singaporeans will be aged over 65 years old by 2030. And with an ageing population, the demand for care increases. For instance, in 2019, patients aged 65 and above spent an average of 6.9 days in a public hospital, compared with 3.9 days for those who were younger."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00625,2021-11-03-T-020,625,Tin Pei Ling,"Secondly, family size is shrinking in Singapore. The average resident household size in 2020 was 3.22, whereas it was 4.25 in 1990. This is according to SingStats. That is equivalent to one less person in the family to share anything within a 20-year period."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00626,2021-11-03-T-020,626,Tin Pei Ling,"Thirdly, more members of a household are working. Households with both husband and wife working increased from 47.1% in 2010 to 52.5% in 2020."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00627,2021-11-03-T-020,627,Tin Pei Ling,"Taken together, the need for care is increasing but the capacity of families to care for their loved ones is diminishing. Hence, ensuring availability and accessibility to caregivers and caregiving services become increasingly important."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00628,2021-11-03-T-020,628,Tin Pei Ling,"In keeping pace with the changing social structure in Singapore, the Government must, of course, be recognised for making tremendous effort to support Singaporean families."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00629,2021-11-03-T-020,629,Tin Pei Ling,"One, care capacity in the form of day care centres and care institutions increased. For instance, the number of home care and day care places increased to 10,300 and 9,000 respectively in 2019. Infant care centres and childcare centres increased 30% and 11% respectively within the same period. Care workers have also grown. For example, certified educators in the early childhood sector grew by 30% between 2016 and 2020."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00630,2021-11-03-T-020,630,Tin Pei Ling,"Two, a range of childcare and eldercare subsidies and assistance schemes was introduced over the years to enhance affordability, including the Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund and the Home Caregiving Grant to support caregivers who gave up their jobs to care for their loved ones and low- or no-income care recipients."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00631,2021-11-03-T-020,631,Tin Pei Ling,"However, the role of migrant domestic workers remains integral to how Singaporean families choose to provide care or supplement caregiving for their loved ones."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00632,2021-11-03-T-020,632,Tin Pei Ling,"Firstly, an MDW can offer care one-to-one and, hence, more human touch, more personalised and personable."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00633,2021-11-03-T-020,633,Tin Pei Ling,"Secondly, this offers greater flexibility to families with members having to work. For instance, the MDW can help to fetch the toddler or senior from the care centre should the parents or children work overtime or have irregular working hours."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00634,2021-11-03-T-020,634,Tin Pei Ling,"That MDWs are an integral part of the caregiving landscape in Singapore can be observed by how the number of MDWs increased 27% to 255,800 from 2010 to June 2019. This is equivalent to having ""every fifth Singaporean household (hiring) a maid"", and I am quoting from CNA."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00635,2021-11-03-T-020,635,Tin Pei Ling,I am also sure that we have heard of heartwarming stories of how MDWs grew with families and became an integral household member over time.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00636,2021-11-03-T-020,636,Tin Pei Ling,"It is, however, not all rosy. There are challenges faced by families hiring MDWs. Of course, there have been cases of MDWs being abused or mistreated by their employers. Such egregious cases must be made known and properly dealt with by the law. MOM and several non-government organisations’ efforts in ensuring proper and fair treatment of MDWs should be recognised."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00637,2021-11-03-T-020,637,Tin Pei Ling,"But most Singaporean families who hire MDWs are decent employers who need care support at home and who do take care of their MDWs, pay on time and try their best to do good on their own."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00638,2021-11-03-T-020,638,Tin Pei Ling,"In my many conversations with residents, I have learnt of the struggles that some of these families face with their MDWs. Following my Parliamentary Questions in September and October 2021’s Sittings, more Singaporeans from within and outside of my constituency wrote to me to share their own experiences."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00639,2021-11-03-T-020,639,Tin Pei Ling,"From the stories they shared, the challenges they face can be broadly categorised into three types  number one, escalating salary expectations; number two, disputes, specifically allegations of abuse; and number three, demand for transfer ""or else""."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00640,2021-11-03-T-020,640,Tin Pei Ling,"These challenges had been fomenting pre-COVID but the challenging situation ""boiled over"" when the supply of MDWs was curbed by travel restrictions during the pandemic. When the inflow of MDWs was controlled to a trickle, families desperate for help turned to those available for transfers. So, the supply fell but demand continued to rise, resulting in a price surge."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00641,2021-11-03-T-020,641,Tin Pei Ling,"In the Minister for Manpower’s written reply to my Parliamentary Question in September this year, I note that the monthly salary increased from $570 to $590 for new MDWs and $610 to $630 for transfer MDWs. That translates to about 3.2% to 3.5%, and that is from end 2019 to end 2020. And in the more recent report which was published yesterday, I think this has gone up to $660 for transfer MDWs just earlier this year."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00642,2021-11-03-T-020,642,Tin Pei Ling,"However, I was also told that in a bid to secure helpers urgently, some salary offers went up to as high as more than $1,000 per month on top of paying for food, accommodation and medical expenses."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00643,2021-11-03-T-020,643,Tin Pei Ling,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I share a screenshot on the LCD screens here?"
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00644,2021-11-03-T-020,644,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00645,2021-11-03-T-020,645,Tin Pei Ling,"The image on-screen is small, but this is an example. Such offers were publicised in Facebook groups such as ""Singapore transfer helpers (maids) direct hire""."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00646,2021-11-03-T-020,646,Tin Pei Ling,"Consequently, some MDWs with an ongoing contract demanded to end existing contracts so that they could be transferred to employers who could pay more. One Facebook user called ""Minyu"", who commented on my page, shared that some agents poach MDWs by offering higher salaries so that the agents can benefit from the additional agent fee. This, if true, will undoubtedly exacerbate the situation."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00647,2021-11-03-T-020,647,Tin Pei Ling,"Families stunned by such requests have little option – they could not just find a replacement easily especially during the pandemic period. Many of such families dare not ask the MDWs to honour the contracts and stay on because their loved ones are literally in the hands of the MDW. Hence, they either offer a higher salary or consent to the transfer. The latter obviously leaves families with real care needs in the lurch. Such phenomenon would also come across as favouring the high earners."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00648,2021-11-03-T-020,648,Tin Pei Ling,"In some instances where families were reluctant to the transfer requests, allegations of abuse were made to force a transfer. A young working mother of two called ""AK"" in short, shared with me in an email that her helper accused her family of providing insufficient food and rest and demanded a transfer. Thankfully, ""AK"" had CCTV footages to prove that the allegations were untrue."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00649,2021-11-03-T-020,649,Tin Pei Ling,"Several other Singaporeans shared their unpleasant experiences with me via social media and through conversations. Upon receiving complaints of possible abuse, MOM would have to investigate and the process can take months. During this time, the families face challenges hiring replacements. And even if the allegations were eventually found to be baseless, the MDWs often faced no legal consequence and were sent back to their home countries, at worst. Innocent families that had endured the ordeal are then left to pick up the pieces on their own. Many felt helpless."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00650,2021-11-03-T-020,650,Tin Pei Ling,"Again, it must be recognised that there are egregious cases of real abuse and these must be dealt with by the law. But false allegations without real consequences seem unfair too. As such, a number of Singaporean employers wrote to me to express their desire for fairer treatment and called for more help."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00651,2021-11-03-T-020,651,Tin Pei Ling,"So, how to make it better? The good news now is that the MOM has relaxed the measures to allow vaccinated migrant domestic workers to enter Singapore just a few days ago from 1 November 2021. This mitigates the challenging situation to some extent, but some underlying issues remain to be solved."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00652,2021-11-03-T-020,652,Tin Pei Ling,"A few suggestions, therefore, for MOM’s consideration."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00653,2021-11-03-T-020,653,Tin Pei Ling,"First, on improving access for middle-income or ""sandwiched"" families. So, the first one is that it is important to ensure equitable access to hiring MDWs for ordinary Singaporean families with real care needs. Thus, could we consider introducing a higher tier of MDW levy for high-income non-local households to mitigate the imbalance of paying power?"
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00654,2021-11-03-T-020,654,Tin Pei Ling,"Second, to introduce consequences for errant irresponsible MDWs."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00655,2021-11-03-T-020,655,Tin Pei Ling,"So, the second one is to ensure completeness of individual MDWs' employment history so that it is usable. A Singaporean employer by the name ""Han"" who hired a MDW to care for her grandparents shared her experiences over email. She showed me screenshots of the MDW's history of several employment but the column for reason of cancellation was entirely blank. She asked how could one objectively assess prospective MDWs? Therefore, could MOM consider requiring employment agencies (EAs) to fill in the reason for cancellation or allow employers to do so directly? Many families also do not know of the existence of such records and it would be very useful if more publicity can be done."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00656,2021-11-03-T-020,656,Tin Pei Ling,"Third, to encourage matching to be taken more seriously, could MOM consider imposing a cap on the number of transfers initiated by the MDW in a year? Exceeding that cap with no valid reason and proof would then require the MDW to return to their home country. Presently, I am aware that employers who repeatedly request for transfers in a short period of time face restrictions in hiring MDWs. So, it would seem fair to ensure all parties involved to take the contract seriously."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00657,2021-11-03-T-020,657,Tin Pei Ling,"Fourth, could there be more stringent checks or restrictions on MDWs with a poor performance record when re-entering Singapore for new jobs?"
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00658,2021-11-03-T-020,658,Tin Pei Ling,Next is on building up responsible EAs.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00659,2021-11-03-T-020,659,Tin Pei Ling,"So, the fifth recommendation is that I learnt from MOM's response to my Parliamentary Question last month that the Ministry is working to encourage EAs to take greater ownership of matching outcomes. If so, could the MOM consider allowing the matching of MDWs be done by local EAs only, that is, to disallow private bartering via social media platforms which are unregulated? However, I understand that there are concerns about whether this will give EAs too much power and risk high agency fees. Perhaps, MOM could pay more attention to this."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00660,2021-11-03-T-020,660,Tin Pei Ling,"And lastly, for support for employers."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00661,2021-11-03-T-020,661,Tin Pei Ling,"The sixth and last recommendation is that many Singaporean families who need MDWs for care needs are crying for greater support. Some are busy trying to make ends meet and some are just not savvy with the systems. Thus, could MOM consider establishing neutral advisory channel or platform offering these families information and consultations?"
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00662,2021-11-03-T-020,662,Tin Pei Ling,"In conclusion, as Singapore continues to enhance our overall care support system, the role of migrant domestic workers in how Singaporean families choose to provide care for their loved ones remain important. In ensuring a successful relationship between the employer family and the MDW will require genuine efforts and mutual respect from both parties. Hence, I hope with the challenges addressed, families will feel more supported and better able to focus on their work and pursue a happier life."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00663,2021-11-03-T-020,663,Speaker,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00664,2021-11-03-T-020,664,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will continue building on the hon Member Ms Tin Pei Ling's points by talking about MDW care for our seniors."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00665,2021-11-03-T-020,665,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"By 2050, almost half of Singapore's total population will be at least 65. As such, care support is of utmost concern not just for our elders but for the adult children who bear the responsibility to look after their own children and their aged parents. It has been said in this Chamber that the true costs of caregiving affects certain groups disproportionately."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00666,2021-11-03-T-020,666,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"During the closing session of the conversations on Singapore women's development, the Prime Minister acknowledged that women often tend to have additional caregiving responsibilities for both young and old and that more can be done to support them emotionally and financially. Dependence on such unpaid family caregivers who are usually women is not longer tenable."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00667,2021-11-03-T-020,667,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In the late 1970s, the foreign maid scheme was launched to enable families to employ MDWs and support women's participation in the workplace."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00668,2021-11-03-T-020,668,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In May this year, it was announced that all new entry approvals for work pass holders from countries with higher risk of COVID-19 will be temporarily halted, including Indonesia, Philippines and Myanmar, all three of which provide the bulk of Singapore's MDWs. Many of us would have had residents appealed to us to allow MDWs to secure entry approvals to care for both young and old in Singapore. With dual income households now forming more than half of all married couples as of 2020, an MDW is often considered an important of fulfilling caregiving needs for families from various income backgrounds."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00669,2021-11-03-T-020,669,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Let us take stock briefly. Aside from MDWs, what caregiving solutions are available for seniors? This is my focus today."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00670,2021-11-03-T-020,670,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"AIC has developed the network of community care services which fall under three broad themes  homecare, daycare and stay-in care. These initiatives are greatly appreciated. However, they can come across as piece-meal with multiple application processes and many adult children rely on an MDW as an all-in-one solution to care for their aged parents. There is almost a quarter of a million MDWs here on work permits as of June 2021. And despite the pandemic, some reports have suggested that the demand for MDWs remains steady, if not, increased, even as costs trended upwards."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00671,2021-11-03-T-020,671,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,MDWs continue to be important as part of our caregiving landscape for a few key reasons.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00672,2021-11-03-T-020,672,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"First, seniors have complex needs and applying for different segregated services can be more expensive and inconvenient. Round trips for medical transport services are between $62 and $90 before subsidies, which can be unaffordable for some. In Cheng San-Seletar, I am very grateful for community befrienders who often step in to accompany seniors, who are fall risks to their hospital appointments."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00673,2021-11-03-T-020,673,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"On the other hand, home personal care costs cost approximately $20 per hour prior to means test subsidies and referrals from hospitals or polyclinics are often required. With higher collective costs and sometimes incomplete combinations of services, hiring an MDW is often a coherent solution."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00674,2021-11-03-T-020,674,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Second, our seniors tend to price independence and have preferences against institutionalised care. The perceived loss of independence in a nursing home is something they are concerned about and so children hire MDW as this support is compatible with their filial duty to meet their parents' desires to age-in-place without compromising on safety."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00675,2021-11-03-T-020,675,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"One possible solution is the model recently announced by HDB, MOH and MND  the Community Care Apartments to encourage independent living. And I am very much looking forward to see how care can be better aggregated so our seniors live with dignity in their golden years."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00676,2021-11-03-T-020,676,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Lastly, prior to the pandemic, families often turned to MDWs as a more timely solution due to unfamiliarity with existing schemes and the limited time in finding suitable caregiving options. Some have also raised concerns about the waiting list for subsidised elder sitting services and nursing homes and looking for suitable step-down care services causes stress for families. Many also find it risky to wait and see if their loved ones qualify for a subsidised space or not."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00677,2021-11-03-T-020,677,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, MDWs will likely continue to be part of our caregiving landscape. Closer attention should be paid to the matching and training of our MDWs. There are stories of MDWs experiencing burnout when expectations of their jobs are mismatched with the tasks required."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00678,2021-11-03-T-020,678,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"A study conducted by AWARE and HOME shared this sentiment, pointing to the lack of information provided by employers and verification by employment agencies. We could look at establishing a more thorough needs assessment, which can be verified by employment agencies through submitted health records. Should that be a mismatch of skills and job requirements, employers can then apply for the caregivers' training grant to upskill the MDW."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00679,2021-11-03-T-020,679,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Another proposal would be expanding the homecare giving grant (HCG). Currently, the grant provides a $200 monthly payout to families supporting their loved ones with permanent moderate disability. Qualifying for the grant requires means testing and assessment of the care recipient's ability to carry out activities of daily living or ADL. These measures ensure that the ones with the most needs receive the grant but it leaves a gap where vulnerable groups can fall into. For instance, a dual income couple with an elderly mother and two young children may find themselves needing an MDW but they may fail to qualify for the HCG because their elderly mother only requires assistance to perform two ADLs, despite having other chronic health issues. Even though hiring an MDW may be the least expensive option, this sandwiched class of families will be paying the full price."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00680,2021-11-03-T-020,680,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"We could explore a points-based system where the number of ADLs that require assistance in household per capita, a monthly income can be tiered. A combination of these scores can provide a fuller picture for families in greater financial need versus separating the financial and functional criteria."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00681,2021-11-03-T-020,681,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In addition, we can also explore compensating part-time family caregivers better under the grant. In Hawaii, for example, their Kupuna Caregivers Assistance Act provides a daily stipend to a caregiver who is also working 30 hours a week. This approach allows caregivers to continue working in some capacity, or dial back at work while assuming caregiving responsibilities."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00682,2021-11-03-T-020,682,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In closing, I wish to acknowledge and highlight the challenges faced by many Singaporeans during this pandemic in employing MDWs to support caregiving needs. Some have described being at their wits end, finishing up annual leave to race to their loved ones’ side. One resident shared that while waiting for the entry approval of an MDW to be approved, she would take turns to care for her elderly mother who was a fall risk, with her brother. Both siblings lived separately from their mother."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00683,2021-11-03-T-020,683,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I thank AIC who had seen her to discuss care options, but none were suitable as her mother had an illness which prevented her from going into a care home and in any event strongly did not want to do so, prizing independence. The daughter felt a deep sense of filial piety and did not insist. However, when her brother and his family was on Quarantine Order, the 14 days back then which ensued were a nightmare for her as she struggled to balance work and caregiving, and even thought about quitting her job."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00684,2021-11-03-T-020,684,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I know many families have faced this dilemma too and hope we can look ahead to ensure that our caregiving needs are met, women are allowed to participate actively in the workforce and we also support our MDWs to be more equipped and better prepared for the roles they take on in our families."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00685,2021-11-03-T-020,685,Speaker,Minister of State Gan Siow Huang.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00686,2021-11-03-T-020,686,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Members for sharing their views on the role of Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) in the caregiving landscape in Singapore and their suggestions on how we can better support MDW employers given our ageing population."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00687,2021-11-03-T-020,687,Gan Siow Huang,"In my response, I will address the following points  one, MDWs' role in the caregiving landscape in Singapore; and two, measures to support employers in hiring and managing domestic helpers."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00688,2021-11-03-T-020,688,Gan Siow Huang,I share Members' views that MDWs continue to be important to support households with caregiving needs.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00689,2021-11-03-T-020,689,Gan Siow Huang,"Over the years, the Government has dedicated efforts to improve accessibility, affordability and quality of care options overall. These include expanding the capacity of long-term care services for seniors and persons with disabilities, childcare and afterschool care centres for children."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00690,2021-11-03-T-020,690,Gan Siow Huang,"MND, MOH and HDB have also launched the first assisted living flats in February this year, which integrate senior-friendly design features with care services that can be scaled according to the care needs. This enables seniors to live independently while meeting their current and future care needs."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00691,2021-11-03-T-020,691,Gan Siow Huang,"To improve the affordability of care, various subsidy schemes have been put in for residential, day and homecare services, respite care services, childcare and infant care services. Families may apply for the means-tested Home Caregiving Grant, which can be used flexibly for different caregiving expenses, such as hiring of MDWs to care for an individual with permanent moderate disability. MOH is reviewing the Home Caregiving Grant to provide more help for targeted groups."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00692,2021-11-03-T-020,692,Gan Siow Huang,"With the increasing complexity of care provision, it is important for MDWs to be trained in essential skills for caregiving. Employers may enrol their MDWs for various training courses to empower them to provide higher-quality care. Today, there are 200 training courses provided by 50 training providers that are available for employers to send their domestic helpers to. They may tap on the Caregivers Training Grant to offset training costs for the care of elderly or disabled loved ones."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00693,2021-11-03-T-020,693,Gan Siow Huang,"Members have suggested higher levy for non-local high-income households. I would like to clarify that we already pay special attention to local households with caregiving needs. This is why only households with at least a Singaporean member with care needs are eligible for the concessionary levy rate of $60 per month. All non-local households, with or without caregiving needs, pay the non-concessionary rate of $300 per month."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00694,2021-11-03-T-020,694,Gan Siow Huang,Some employers have managed to do without MDWs by tapping on institutional care options or engaging companies under the Household Services Scheme to meet their household needs.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00695,2021-11-03-T-020,695,Gan Siow Huang,"However, for many employers, the options I have mentioned may not fully meet their needs and MDWs remain important to them."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00696,2021-11-03-T-020,696,Gan Siow Huang,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employers have been impacted by the limited supply of MDWs to Singapore. Amidst the shortage of MDWs, some employers face requests by their MDWs for higher wages or a transfer."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00697,2021-11-03-T-020,697,Gan Siow Huang,"I understand the difficulties an employer goes through if an MDW seeks a transfer before the end of the contract. To alleviate the financial burden incurred by employers, MOM recently introduced a policy to allow the incumbent and subsequent employers to share the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) costs and COVID-19 tests costs incurred by an MDW when she entered Singapore, should the change of employer take place within 12 months of employment."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00698,2021-11-03-T-020,698,Gan Siow Huang,"As I mentioned in the House yesterday, the local and regional COVID-19 situation continues to stabilise and we have begun to grant more entry approvals for MDWs to come to Singapore. The current MDW supply crunch is expected to improve in the coming months."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00699,2021-11-03-T-020,699,Gan Siow Huang,"In the longer term, MOM will diversify the countries from which MDWs are hired. However, we must recognise that there will continue to be competition for MDWs, not just locally but also from countries in the region. Besides reasonable remuneration to attract MDWs to work in Singapore, there is also a need to position Singapore as an attractive workplace destination for MDWs, to ensure resilience in our MDW supply."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00700,2021-11-03-T-020,700,Gan Siow Huang,"Other than the measures to enable a steady stream of MDWs for Singapore, it is equally important to ensure that employers are matched with MDWs who best meet their needs, as well as provide support to employers and MDWs to foster good employment relationships."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00701,2021-11-03-T-020,701,Gan Siow Huang,"Members have suggested that matching be done only by local employment agencies (EAs) and to disallow direct hiring of MDWs. Today, more than 80% of employers hire their MDWs with the help of an EA. For the remaining employers who prefer to hire their MDWs directly to avoid incurring additional costs of engaging an EA, disallowing them to self-help would inadvertently increase their costs of hiring MDWs."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00702,2021-11-03-T-020,702,Gan Siow Huang,"Instead of placing a cap on the maximum number of transfers for an MDW, MOM has adopted the approach of making information more transparent so that employers can make informed decisions when hiring MDWs, including those who have had frequent transfers."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00703,2021-11-03-T-020,703,Gan Siow Huang,"Employers may access information relating to prospective MDWs’ work experiences and the types and sizes of households that they have worked in before. Employers can also view the length of each past employment and the reasons why these MDWs left their past employers, including information on the party that initiated the discontinuation of employment. We started collecting the reasons from employers for the cancellation of MDW's Work Permits since September last year. With time, the information in the MDW employment history will become more comprehensive."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00704,2021-11-03-T-020,704,Gan Siow Huang,The employer reference channel also allows prospective employers to contact the former employers of the MDWs they are looking to hire for reference checks.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00705,2021-11-03-T-020,705,Gan Siow Huang,MOM will look into how we can raise awareness of these existing measures amongst employers.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00706,2021-11-03-T-020,706,Gan Siow Huang,"Other than improving matching outcomes, MOM has also put in place measures to support employers and MDWs during the course of employment."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00707,2021-11-03-T-020,707,Gan Siow Huang,"It is not uncommon for there to be differences in expectations in a working relationship, especially at the initial stage when both parties are adjusting, be it to a new environment or having a new person living in your home. Most misunderstandings between MDWs and their employers are resolved amicably."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00708,2021-11-03-T-020,708,Gan Siow Huang,"However, like Members alluded to, there are instances where both parties are unable to resolve the disputes on their own. For such cases, help can be sought from the employment agencies and via dispute resolution services offered by professionals through the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) and Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE)."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00709,2021-11-03-T-020,709,Gan Siow Huang,"From 1 December onwards, we will also require all employment agencies to conduct post-placement checks to ensure that MDWs and their employers are adjusting well."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00710,2021-11-03-T-020,710,Gan Siow Huang,MOM takes all allegations of abuse seriously. MOM officers work with the Police to investigate reports of MDW abuse by employers or household members. Some MDWs were found in the course of Police investigations to have made false allegations against their employers. The Police and MOM will not hesitate to take firm action against such MDWs.
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00711,2021-11-03-T-020,711,Gan Siow Huang,"Over the past two years, Police investigated and issued warnings to 17 MDWs for providing false information against a household member or employer. Of these, 13 were blacklisted and the remaining four are pending a review of case facts."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00712,2021-11-03-T-020,712,Gan Siow Huang,"I would like to share a story about an MDW who made a Police report, claiming that her employer’s wife physically abused her by slapping her limbs over a period of seven months. Upon thorough investigation by the Police, the MDW admitted to providing false information against her employer in a bid to end her employment. She was charged under the Penal Code for providing false information, convicted and sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. She was also repatriated and banned from working in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00713,2021-11-03-T-020,713,Gan Siow Huang,"We encourage employers and MDWs to maintain open communication with one another, discuss their concerns and resolve disputes amicably. Fostering a sense of mutual trust and respect can help prevent misunderstandings from occurring."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00714,2021-11-03-T-020,714,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Speaker, to wrap up, the caregiving landscape in Singapore will get more challenging as our population ages. MDWs are part of the caregiving solutions here. MOM has introduced several measures to support MDW employers in hiring and managing their MDWs. We will continue to find ways to safeguard the interests of MDW employers while protecting the well-being of MDWs. Ultimately, for MDWs to continue to be part of the caregiving landscape, we strive to build a system that is fair to both the MDW employers and the MDWs."
2021-11-03-T-020-S-00715,2021-11-03-T-020,715,Gan Siow Huang,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2021-11-03-T-020-S-00717,2021-11-03-T-020,717,Gan Siow Huang,Adjourned accordingly at 6.21 pm.
2021-11-03-T-021-S-00718,2021-11-03-T-021,718,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the  Minister for Trade and Industry
2021-11-03-T-021-S-00719,2021-11-03-T-021,719,Gan Kim Yong,"From December 2019 to June 2021, 3,440 F&B businesses ceased operations, while 5,620 new F&B businesses were formed."
2021-11-03-T-021-S-00720,2021-11-03-T-021,720,Gan Kim Yong,"Total employment in the F&B sector was lower by about eight percent in June 2021 compared to December 2019. The Government has supported the Food Services sector with enhanced wage support under the Jobs Support Scheme to help F&B firms retain local workers and cope with business costs during this challenging period. Last April, Enterprise Singapore also introduced the Food Delivery Booster Package to encourage F&B businesses to tap on food delivery services, by defraying commission and delivery costs. The Government is also committed to supporting job seekers through Workforce Singapore’s Careers Connect and NTUC’s e2i career centres, and initiatives under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package."
2021-11-03-T-022-S-00721,2021-11-03-T-022,721,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the  Minister for Health
2021-11-03-T-022-S-00722,2021-11-03-T-022,722,Ong Ye Kung,"We recognise that reduced social interactions can negatively impact the socio-emotional and mental well-being of seniors, including those with dementia. Hence, centre-based services, including exercise and cognitive activities, remain available, albeit at reduced capacities due to Safe Management Measures (SMM)."
2021-11-03-T-022-S-00723,2021-11-03-T-022,723,Ong Ye Kung,"For dementia patients who require mental health support during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to make available our community mental health services, with added precautionary measures, to monitor their condition and escalate them for timely interventions if necessary. Intervention and counselling are conducted through telephone or video consultations for suitable patients. Service personnel will conduct home visits with SMM in place for those unsuitable for online or remote intervention."
2021-11-03-T-022-S-00724,2021-11-03-T-022,724,Ong Ye Kung,"While certain high-risk activities such as group activities, mask-off activities and door-to-door outreach services have been curtailed, in-person service is allowed to support patients with severe dementia, inadequate family support and intensive care needs, such as those at risk of injury or are at high risk of relapse of their dementia and/ or psychiatric conditions."
2021-11-03-T-022-S-00725,2021-11-03-T-022,725,Ong Ye Kung,"As we move into the Stabilisation Phase, we aim to have more partners gradually resume their activities and dementia patients would be able to continue their social activities in the community with SMM in place."
2021-11-03-T-023-S-00726,2021-11-03-T-023,726,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the  Minister for Home Affairs
2021-11-03-T-023-S-00727,2021-11-03-T-023,727,K Shanmugam,The integration between Singapore’s PayNow and Thailand’s PromptPay started in April 2021.
2021-11-03-T-023-S-00728,2021-11-03-T-023,728,K Shanmugam,"Within Singapore, as of September 2021, there have been no reported cases of scams perpetrated through this integration. However, MHA is aware of at least one case taking place outside Singapore, where an e-commerce scam used the PayNow-PromptPay integration to have the money transferred to the scammer."
2021-11-03-T-023-S-00729,2021-11-03-T-023,729,K Shanmugam,"The same safeguards imposed for domestic PayNow transfers apply to cross-border transfers made via the PayNow-PromptPay linkage. These include the use of online banking credentials to access PayNow-PromptPay services, and customisable limits on daily transfer amounts. In addition, there is a system-imposed daily cap of S$1,000. Users are also able to check the identity of the recipient before making the transfer, after keying in the mobile phone number of the recipient."
2021-11-03-T-023-S-00730,2021-11-03-T-023,730,K Shanmugam,"As scammers based overseas may try to exploit advancements in cross-border integration of banking services to get their victims to directly transfer monies overseas, we urge users to practise healthy skepticism in verifying the authenticity of the transactions, make full use of the safeguards available, as well as to pause, check and confirm before effecting the transfer."
2021-11-03-T-024-S-00731,2021-11-03-T-024,731,Wan Rizal,asked the  Minister for Foreign Affairs
2021-11-03-T-024-S-00732,2021-11-03-T-024,732,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On part (a) of the query, we do not have statistics on the COVID-19 vaccination rates of Singaporean students who are based abroad."
2021-11-03-T-024-S-00733,2021-11-03-T-024,733,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The Singapore Government is mindful of the challenges faced by overseas Singaporeans, including our students based overseas, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been urging all Singaporeans to get vaccinated. Those who are leaving for overseas studies this year would have had the opportunity to be vaccinated in Singapore before they depart. We understand that some Singaporeans prefer to or may find it difficult to return to Singapore to be vaccinated. We have therefore launched two dedicated vaccination channels recently to make it more convenient for overseas Singaporeans, including our Singaporean students studying abroad, to return to Singapore for vaccination while minimising the time they are required to spend in SHN. As of 31 October 2021, we have received close to 250 successful sign-ups from overseas Singaporeans."
2021-11-03-T-024-S-00734,2021-11-03-T-024,734,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our Overseas Missions have pro-actively and regularly engaged Singaporean student communities to address their COVID-19 concerns and provided consular assistance to them if required. Our Overseas Missions have provided support and guidance to students who have contracted COVID-19 abroad or had to self-isolate due to being close contacts or from travelling. Such support includes keeping their next-of-kin in Singapore updated of their situation, and connecting the affected individuals with relevant student support groups for the provision of meals and medical supplies."
2021-11-03-T-024-S-00735,2021-11-03-T-024,735,Vivian Balakrishnan,"These regular engagements with our overseas Singaporean student community enabled our Missions to address in a timely manner any concerns raised by our students overseas and keep them abreast of the latest COVID-19 information so that they could remain safe and informed of public health and safety requirements, as well as developments in both their resident countries and Singapore. In view of the pandemic, Missions and the Singapore Global Network have increasingly leveraged social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Whatsapp, as well as local social media platforms like Weibo, to address students’ COVID-19 concerns, including their queries related to travel and border measures. MFA will continue to prioritise such regular engagement and the provision of timely consular assistance and advice to Singaporean students abroad, to ensure their safety and well-being. Once again, we will urge all Singaporean students abroad to e-register with MFA if they have not already done so."
2021-11-03-T-025-S-00736,2021-11-03-T-025,736,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the  Minister for National Development
2021-11-03-T-025-S-00737,2021-11-03-T-025,737,Desmond Lee,"Smoking in one’s flat may cause nuisance and health concerns to neighbours if cigarette smoke wafts into their homes. While this is covered by the covenant referred to by the Member, enforcing the breach of a covenant under the lease entails compulsory acquisition of the flat. This is a harsh measure that is not undertaken lightly. HDB exercises the right of compulsory acquisition sparingly and often as a last resort. Moreover, should a flat be compulsorily acquired, the flat owners and occupants of the flat, such as their family members, will need to relocate and find a home elsewhere. If the underlying issues are not resolved, the issue will just be brought over to another community."
2021-11-03-T-025-S-00738,2021-11-03-T-025,738,Desmond Lee,"Hence, the approach to manage disamenities and disputes between neighbours is for neighbours to come together to try to resolve the matter amicably. When residents provide feedback to agencies on second-hand tobacco smoke issues, HDB, together with Town Councils and the National Environment Agency, will first encourage neighbours to speak to each other to try to resolve the matter. Where necessary, a Joint Advisory on Smoking in Homes will be issued to the residential unit reported to be emitting second-hand smoke, encouraging considerate behaviour and emphasising the negative impact that second-hand smoke may have on their neighbours."
2021-11-03-T-025-S-00739,2021-11-03-T-025,739,Desmond Lee,"If this does not work, the agencies will advise the affected neighbour to seek mediation. In intractable cases, the affected neighbour may file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT). If the respondent is shown to have caused unreasonable interference to the affected neighbour, then the CDRT may make a range of orders against the respondent, including requiring the respondent to cease or refrain from carrying out certain acts."
2021-11-03-T-026-S-00740,2021-11-03-T-026,740,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the  Minister for Health
2021-11-03-T-026-S-00741,2021-11-03-T-026,741,Ong Ye Kung,"In a pandemic crisis, Government has extended full subsidies for nationally recommended vaccinations, including boosters, that offer protection against COVID-19. As we progressively transit to living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, we will monitor the global and local situation, and periodically review the need for booster doses of COVID-19 vaccinations, and whether they should remain fully subsidised."
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00742,2021-11-03-T-027,742,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the  Minister for Home Affairs
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00743,2021-11-03-T-027,743,K Shanmugam,"The case mentioned by the Member involved an inmate who was assaulted by two other inmates at the Changi Prison Complex. The victim was waiting in the medical centre for his medical review. He was suddenly assaulted by two other inmates who were in the same room. A prison officer who was in the monitoring room saw the assault and responded with two other officers within 20 seconds, and stopped the assault. The two inmates who had assaulted the victim have been charged in Court. One has been sentenced, and the other is pending sentencing."
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00744,2021-11-03-T-027,744,K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has measures in place to try to prevent assault incidents from occurring, and to respond swiftly when they do."
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00745,2021-11-03-T-027,745,K Shanmugam,"First, Prison officers actively look out for signs of conflict between inmates. Inmates are also informed that they can approach staff if they encounter any issues or fear for their safety."
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00746,2021-11-03-T-027,746,K Shanmugam,"Second, inmates who are assessed to be of higher risk of violence undergo programmes to address their violent behaviours."
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00747,2021-11-03-T-027,747,K Shanmugam,"Third, SPS leverages technology to detect incidents and intervene swiftly. SPS is expanding its use of surveillance cameras to monitor all areas which inmates have access to. SPS is also using video analytics to detect abnormal or aggressive behaviours. When this capability is fully in place, officers can be alerted and respond to suspected fights, medical emergencies or suicidal behaviour, even quicker."
2021-11-03-T-027-S-00748,2021-11-03-T-027,748,K Shanmugam,"SPS takes incidents of assault very seriously, and will continue to review and enhance its operational capabilities to deter inmates from committing assault, and to be able to swiftly detect and respond."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00749,2021-11-03-T-028,749,Mariam Jaafar,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of the increase in job losses among middle-income PMETs, whether the Ministry will review social assistance schemes, in particular the treatment of debt such as renovation loans and insurance payments as expenses."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00750,2021-11-03-T-028,750,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government has introduced various measures to help Singaporeans cope with the impact of COVID-19. To protect workers and save jobs, we introduced the Jobs Support Scheme and Jobs Growth Incentive to help firms retain and hire Singaporeans, and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package to help them access job and training opportunities."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00751,2021-11-03-T-028,751,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) supports lower- to middle-income resident employees and self-employed persons who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are involuntarily unemployed, or are experiencing involuntary no-pay leave or significant income loss for at least three consecutive months. The CRG assistance provides temporary support while these individuals actively search for new job or training opportunities."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00752,2021-11-03-T-028,752,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Households facing financial difficulties can approach our Social Service Offices (SSOs), who will assess their needs and circumstances, and provide ComCare assistance if they meet the criteria. ComCare beneficiaries receive comprehensive support that includes cash assistance to help the family meet the income shortfall for their daily living expenses on basic needs, such as food, transport, and communications. Depending on the household’s needs, they may also receive free medical treatment at public healthcare institutions and be referred to relevant government agencies or our community partners for further support."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00753,2021-11-03-T-028,753,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, the ComCare cash assistance provided does not cover loans or instalment payments, which will vary depending on the household’s financial decisions and use of credit. Such payments also generally contribute towards the building of personal assets, which would not be appropriate for the Government to fund via public resources. Our social assistance schemes therefore prioritise support for daily living expenses instead."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00754,2021-11-03-T-028,754,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nonetheless we understand the pressures that families with debts face, and our SSOs will support ComCare beneficiaries with outstanding loans or instalment payments to take steps towards regaining financial stability. For instance, we will refer families with debts to relevant debt advisory services like Credit Counselling Singapore, where personal financial counsellors will guide them on the possible courses of action to manage and reduce their debts. Depending on their circumstances, the families may also receive further assistance to negotiate and/or restructure unsecured loans, so that they can make monthly repayments at reduced interest rates which they can afford. The families will also have access to financial literacy classes to equip themselves with financial planning skills such as budgeting, and support groups where they can seek peer advice."
2021-11-03-T-028-S-00755,2021-11-03-T-028,755,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government will continue to regularly review the coverage and support quantum of our various measures, to ensure that Singaporeans are supported in meeting their needs."
2021-11-03-T-029-S-00756,2021-11-03-T-029,756,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the  Minister for Trade and Industry
2021-11-03-T-029-S-00757,2021-11-03-T-029,757,Gan Kim Yong,"Manpower shortages in the construction sector have adversely affected the pace of construction activities and dampened output in the sector. In the first three quarters of 2021, the real value-added of the construction sector was 25 per cent below its pre-pandemic level in the same period of 2019."
2021-11-03-T-029-S-00758,2021-11-03-T-029,758,Gan Kim Yong,"Notwithstanding the resulting delays in construction projects, the overall economy has remained resilient. In the first three quarters of 2021, the real GDP of the Singapore economy had recovered to 0.6 per cent above its level in the same period of 2019, supported by the strong performance of outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, finance and insurance."
2021-11-03-T-029-S-00759,2021-11-03-T-029,759,Gan Kim Yong,"The Government recognises the challenges faced by the construction sector, and has implemented several measures to alleviate the tight manpower situation in the sector. These include making it easier for construction firms to retain their existing workers, and helping them to bring in new workers. Firms in the sector have also taken the lead to bring in more workers safely through a tightened end-to-end process. The Government remains committed to working with firms in the sector to meet the manpower needs of key ongoing projects."
2021-11-03-T-030-S-00760,2021-11-03-T-030,760,Mariam Jaafar,asked the  Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
2021-11-03-T-030-S-00761,2021-11-03-T-030,761,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"From October 2020 to September 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received an average of 23 construction noise-related complaints each month from residents in Woodlands."
2021-11-03-T-030-S-00762,2021-11-03-T-030,762,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA adopts an outcome-based approach in regulating construction noise. Construction sites must adhere to the regulatory noise limits, and noise meters are installed at the nearest affected premises to monitor compliance."
2021-11-03-T-030-S-00763,2021-11-03-T-030,763,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Under the no-work rule, construction work on Sundays and public holidays is prohibited at sites located within 150 metres of any hospital, home for the aged sick or residential building. From 1 October 2022, contractors that have contravened the no-work rule will be required to install electronic video surveillance systems to ensure compliance and deter further violations."
2021-11-03-T-030-S-00764,2021-11-03-T-030,764,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There are incentives to encourage the construction industry to adopt quieter construction equipment and methods, such as quieter piling and hacking equipment, noise barriers and enclosures. Since April 2014, NEA has disbursed a total of $8.3 million to help contractors adopt quieter construction equipment and methods."
2021-11-03-T-030-S-00765,2021-11-03-T-030,765,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Building and Construction Authority has been actively championing the adoption of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly technologies, which shifts as much on-site construction activities to off-site prefabrication as possible. Construction becomes faster, cleaner, quieter and of higher quality. Dis-amenities such as noise and dust pollution will be reduced, and construction time can be shortened."
2021-11-03-T-031-S-00766,2021-11-03-T-031,766,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the  Minister for Health
2021-11-03-T-031-S-00767,2021-11-03-T-031,767,Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) has received appeals from couples who were unable to continue their assisted reproduction (AR) treatment overseas due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions, and seeking to import their stored gametes or embryos for treatment in Singapore instead. To support these couples, the Ministry established a process for such appeals to be submitted by the AR practitioners on behalf of their patients. This allows MOH to review such requests expeditiously and facilitate the importation of the gametes/embryos where appropriate."
2021-11-03-T-031-S-00768,2021-11-03-T-031,768,Ong Ye Kung,"Fully vaccinated couples may use the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) to travel overseas to continue their AR treatment in these countries. Couples travelling to countries where no VTL arrangement has been set up will be subject to the quarantine requirements both abroad and locally. Alternatively, they may write in to MOH for us to review their request to import their gametes/embryos and continue with treatment locally."
2021-11-03-T-032-S-00769,2021-11-03-T-032,769,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the  Minister for Manpower
2021-11-03-T-032-S-00770,2021-11-03-T-032,770,Tan See Leng,"The Member may be aware that since he filed the question, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has lifted travel restrictions on several non-traditional source countries such as Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, where many of our migrant workers (MWs) in the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors come from."
2021-11-03-T-032-S-00771,2021-11-03-T-032,771,Tan See Leng,"As I have mentioned in this House on 1 November 2021, we have resumed entry approvals for MWs from CMP sectors to enter Singapore in a safe and calibrated manner from 1 November 2021, on the condition that they must be fully vaccinated before arrival. Firms in the CMP sectors who need their workers urgently may consider on-going initiatives in their industries to bring in workers safely with tightened end-to-end safe management processes. Workers can enter without proof of vaccination provided they complete the full vaccination regime within two months after arrival."
2021-11-03-T-032-S-00772,2021-11-03-T-032,772,Tan See Leng,"Given the evolving nature of the regional COVID-19 situation, any changes to entry restrictions will depend on the prevailing situation."
2021-11-03-T-033-S-00773,2021-11-03-T-033,773,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the  Minister for Education
2021-11-03-T-033-S-00774,2021-11-03-T-033,774,Chan Chun Sing,"MOE consciously ensures that we minimise loss of curriculum time and minimise inconvenience for parents without alternative caregiving arrangements. Aside from 12 weeks of school holidays per year, primary school students are notified in advance and do not report to school for another 12 days for PSLE marking, PSLE Oral and Listening Comprehension Examinations, school exam results processing and significant school events such as parent-teachers conference."
2021-11-03-T-033-S-00775,2021-11-03-T-033,775,Chan Chun Sing,Schools may dismiss students earlier on the eve of events such as National Day and Children’s Day. There are four such events in a year.
2021-11-03-T-033-S-00776,2021-11-03-T-033,776,Chan Chun Sing,"For all these days, school-based student care centres remain open for students."
2021-11-03-T-034-S-00777,2021-11-03-T-034,777,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the  Minister for Manpower
2021-11-03-T-034-S-00778,2021-11-03-T-034,778,Tan See Leng,The tripartite partners have issued an advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces to help employers identify and implement initiatives to support their employees’ mental well-being.
2021-11-03-T-034-S-00779,2021-11-03-T-034,779,Tan See Leng,"Most of the recommendations in the advisory can be adopted at little to no cost. For example, companies are already required to undertake risk assessment. The advisory advises them to incorporate mental well-being in these regular risk assessments. iWorkHealth is an online, self-administered psychosocial health assessment tool to identify common workplace stressors. It is provided free. Other recommendations such as encouraging more open and regular conversations on mental well-being and form informal support networks amongst employees likewise do not cost much to the company, but still giving due attention to employees’ mental well-being in the workplace."
2021-11-03-T-034-S-00780,2021-11-03-T-034,780,Tan See Leng,"In addition, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council and Health Promotion Board (HPB) have outreach programmes that include mental well-being support. These too, are offered to SMEs free or at highly subsidised rates. Under the Total WSH Programme, providers work with companies to run interventions to address the safety and health gaps holistically, where mental well-being topics are included. Similarly, HPB’s Workplace Outreach Wellness (WOW) package includes mental well-being programmes that strengthen workplace support for employees and help employees manage stress as well as build mental resilience."
2021-11-03-T-034-S-00781,2021-11-03-T-034,781,Tan See Leng,"With the range of free or highly subsidised services, as well as the simplicity of the interventions themselves, there is really no reason for any firm, whether large or small, to wait for some metric or indicator of distress before attending to their employees’ mental wellness."
2021-11-03-T-035-S-00782,2021-11-03-T-035,782,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Manpower from 2020 to 30 September 2021, what is the number of work injury claims for each year that were (i) filed (ii) paid compensations and (iii) rejected, where the employee sustained the injury whilst working from home."
2021-11-03-T-035-S-00783,2021-11-03-T-035,783,Tan See Leng,"Since the start of Circuit Breaker in April 2020, 53 work injury claims have been filed for injuries sustained by employees while working from home. Thirty-two have been admitted as work injuries and three are being assessed. The rest of the claims were not awarded compensation, for various reasons such as the injury being sustained while performing non-work activities at home."
2021-11-03-T-036-S-00784,2021-11-03-T-036,784,Mariam Jaafar,asked the  Minister for Education
2021-11-03-T-036-S-00785,2021-11-03-T-036,785,Chan Chun Sing,"Out of the total enrolment in our government and government-aided schools, around 9% are permanent residents and 4% are international students."
2021-11-03-T-036-S-00786,2021-11-03-T-036,786,Chan Chun Sing,"A very small minority of these students have at least one Singaporean parent. While these students, being non-citizens, do not have access to the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, they can approach their schools for assistance if needed. MOE will assess their situation and extend support on a case-by-case basis. There are currently about 400 such students being provided with such support."
2021-11-03-T-037-S-00787,2021-11-03-T-037,787,Shahira Abdullah,asked the  Minister for Health
2021-11-03-T-037-S-00788,2021-11-03-T-037,788,Ong Ye Kung,"In all cases where Police have been notified of a death, including when the person is believed to have died by suicide, the Police will inform the deceased’s next-of-kin of the death as soon as reasonably practicable. When attending to death cases, the Police may activate relevant support personnel from Social Service Agencies such as Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) who will then reach out to next-of-kin or loved ones in providing emotional support to the grieving family. SOS may also arrange counselling support for next-of-kin who need and wish to receive additional support. In addition to SOS, individuals can also approach counselling centres and other support groups for support."
2021-11-03-T-037-S-00789,2021-11-03-T-037,789,Ong Ye Kung,"For suicide cases involving students in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), relevant trained school personnel will identify those who may be emotionally affected, and provide the appropriate support according to their needs. Teachers and staff will continue to monitor the well-being of students, and provide guidance and support. For students who require additional targeted support, they will be referred to the in-house counsellors and/or mental health professionals in the community and hospitals. Schools and IHLs also receive support by specialist teams from MOE and other agencies to render support to affected students and staff when needed."
2021-11-03-T-037-S-00790,2021-11-03-T-037,790,Ong Ye Kung,"The Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being will be conducting a public consultation for the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy that is being developed by the Taskforce, and could look into how the deceased’s next-of-kin may be better supported."
2021-11-03-T-038-S-00791,2021-11-03-T-038,791,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the  Minister for Trade and Industry
2021-11-03-T-038-S-00792,2021-11-03-T-038,792,Gan Kim Yong,"Since the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) took on the function of administering the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act in 2018, it has investigated an average of about five cases per year for alleged infringements of the Act."
2021-11-03-T-038-S-00793,2021-11-03-T-038,793,Gan Kim Yong,"The industry breakdown varies from year to year. Of the cases investigated since 2018, half were from the Beauty Services industry. A further 30% were retailers of consumer goods. The remaining 20% were from other industries including F&B, travel and medical consumables."
2021-11-03-T-039-S-00794,2021-11-03-T-039,794,Yip Hon Weng,asked the  Minister for Health
2021-11-03-T-039-S-00795,2021-11-03-T-039,795,Ong Ye Kung,"As at 16 August 2021, there were 32 COVID-19 confirmed reinfection cases. A third of them were dormitory residents; and the remaining were imported cases. From 16 August 2021, formal assessment of reinfections is no longer performed as the national strategy moved away from the eradication strategy. All infections are managed similarly to ensure optimal clinical management and prevention of spread."
2021-11-03-T-039-S-00796,2021-11-03-T-039,796,Ong Ye Kung,"The duration between initial infection and subsequent reinfection varies, with an average of about 300 days. The measures to reduce the risk of transmissions and reinfections in dormitories are similar. First, over 97% of migrant workers, including recovered workers residing in dormitories have been fully vaccinated. Next, we have a multi-layered strategy to contain the spread of COVID-19 within dormitories. This includes implementing Safe Living Measures and infection prevention and control practices to limit transmission in the dormitories, Rostered Routine Testing, and testing workers with acute respiratory illness symptoms to detect outbreaks early. Upon detection, cases are isolated immediately."
2021-11-03-T-040-S-00797,2021-11-03-T-040,797,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the  Minister for Manpower
2021-11-03-T-040-S-00798,2021-11-03-T-040,798,Tan See Leng,"Given the limited number of entry approvals for migrant domestic workers (MDWs) over the past few months, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been prioritising families with urgent caregiving needs, such as households with sick elderly, young children or family members with special needs."
2021-11-03-T-040-S-00799,2021-11-03-T-040,799,Tan See Leng,"There are many unique circumstances under which a household may need to hire more than one MDW to meet their caregiving needs. For example, there are households that hire multiple MDWs because they have young children, including say a child with special needs; or a bed-bound family member who requires round-the-clock care. As such, the entry approvals for MDWs are granted based on the unique circumstances of a household instead of arbitrarily setting a cap to the number of MDWs that can be hired by a household."
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00800,2021-11-03-T-041,800,Leon Perera,asked the  Minister for Education
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00801,2021-11-03-T-041,801,Chan Chun Sing,Our secondary schools are set up to cater to the diverse learning needs of our students. Admission is thus based on students’ choices and their academic and non-academic profiles.
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00802,2021-11-03-T-041,802,Chan Chun Sing,"We have a diverse education landscape so that students can access schools that are best suited to their own aptitudes, interests and learning needs. The majority of our secondary schools offer all three academic courses. At the same time, some schools offer specialised programmes for specific learner profiles – for example Specialised Schools offering practice-oriented, hands-on learning, the six-year Integrated Programme offering a more unstructured and broader academic experience, and specialised schools that cater to specific interests in sports, arts and STEM."
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00803,2021-11-03-T-041,803,Chan Chun Sing,"Admissions at Secondary 1 is determined by the combination of students’ choices and their PSLE Scores or the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise. This enables students to be placed in a school that is suited to their aptitude and ability. As different schools cater to different student profiles, not every school will reflect the same demographic profile."
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00804,2021-11-03-T-041,804,Chan Chun Sing,"What is important is to ensure that schools remain open to students of all backgrounds, and for students from all schools to have the opportunities to interact with those from different backgrounds."
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00805,2021-11-03-T-041,805,Chan Chun Sing,"To do so, we offer bursaries and scholarships to ensure school fees are affordable for all, and have measures that ensure good access to schools, such as the DSA as well as reserving 20% of places for each course in every secondary school for students without affiliation."
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00806,2021-11-03-T-041,806,Chan Chun Sing,"All our schools also provide students with opportunities to interact with others from different backgrounds, including between schools and with the community, such as through co-curricular activities, values-in-action projects, and cluster-based activities and competitions."
2021-11-03-T-041-S-00807,2021-11-03-T-041,807,Chan Chun Sing,"Taken together, our approach strikes a balance to ensure that each student can access schools best suited to their learning needs, while having opportunities to interact with others from different backgrounds."
2021-11-03-T-042-S-00808,2021-11-03-T-042,808,Tan Wu Meng,asked the  Minister for National Development
2021-11-03-T-042-S-00809,2021-11-03-T-042,809,Desmond Lee,"Individuals who wish to register as real estate salespersons (RESs) are required to fulfil the registration criteria, which include having a minimum of four GCE ""O"" Level passes or the equivalent as determined by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA). This ensures that RESs have basic literacy skills to understand the laws and procedures on property transactions, and provide accurate advice to their clients, and is intended to safeguard consumer interests."
2021-11-03-T-042-S-00810,2021-11-03-T-042,810,Desmond Lee,"Benchmarking prior work experience against the literacy requirements can be highly subjective. For instance, work experience based on similar job titles could vary considerably within an industry, and more so across different industries and localities."
2021-11-03-T-042-S-00811,2021-11-03-T-042,811,Desmond Lee,"Individuals without the relevant educational qualifications can take the Workplace Literacy and Numeracy (WPLN) assessment by registering with the British Council. The assessment is highly subsidised for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents and can also be paid for using SkillsFuture Credits. CEA will accept a grading of Level 5 and above for the WPLN assessment in lieu of the four GCE ""O"" Level passes."

2021-11-03-T-047-S-00822,2021-11-03-T-047,822,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the  Minister for Manpower
2021-11-03-T-047-S-00823,2021-11-03-T-047,823,Tan See Leng,"Safe Management Measures for the workplace, including the work-from-home requirement, are calibrated taking into account the public health situation, and employee and business interests."
2021-11-03-T-047-S-00824,2021-11-03-T-047,824,Tan See Leng,"Currently, workplaces are required to operate on a maximum work-from-home mode. This means that all employees who are able to perform their job function from home must do so. As the public health situation improves, we will gradually ease the work-from-home requirement."
2021-11-03-T-047-S-00825,2021-11-03-T-047,825,Tan See Leng,"Employers should consider hybrid work arrangements as part of their future operating model. This will strengthen business resilience to cope with new variants or a future pandemic. Flexible work arrangements also contribute to employees’ work-life harmony, and to staff engagement."
2021-11-03-T-048-S-00826,2021-11-03-T-048,826,Yip Hon Weng,asked the  Minister for Manpower
2021-11-03-T-048-S-00827,2021-11-03-T-048,827,Tan See Leng,"All reports of Migrant Domestic Worker (MDW) abuse are referred to and investigated by the Police. From 2019 to 2020, an average of 300 reports of MDW abuse by employers or household members of the employers were made to the Police each year."
2021-11-03-T-048-S-00828,2021-11-03-T-048,828,Tan See Leng,Seventeen MDWs were found to have made false allegations against their employers and were issued warning by the Police. Thirteen of the MDWs were blacklisted and banned from working in Singapore. The remaining four cases are pending review of the case facts from Police’s investigation.
2021-11-03-T-048-S-00829,2021-11-03-T-048,829,Tan See Leng,"SPF and MOM take a serious view on abuse allegations made by MDWs. Therefore, all complaints and claims are investigated thoroughly and fairly to determine if the allegations are substantiated. MDWs who were found to have provided false information may be punished upon conviction to a fine, up to two years’ imprisonment, or both. Convicted MDWs will also be repatriated and banned from employment in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00830,2021-11-03-T-049,830,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the  Minister for Trade and Industry
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00831,2021-11-03-T-049,831,Gan Kim Yong,"Under the Energy Reset pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Singapore will focus on all four supply ""switches"" to decarbonise our electricity supply. These comprise making our natural gas generators more efficient, maximising solar energy, importing renewable energy, and exploring the use of low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen."
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00832,2021-11-03-T-049,832,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore has limited renewable energy resources. We are on track to achieving our target of at least two gigawatt-peak of solar energy by 2030, but this will only constitute around 3% of our projected total energy consumption. We will need to supplement this with imported low-carbon energy, while we develop other low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen."
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00833,2021-11-03-T-049,833,Gan Kim Yong,"Electricity imports will be a key needle-mover in our energy transition in the near to medium term. We target to import up to four gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will constitute around 30% of our electricity supply."
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00834,2021-11-03-T-049,834,Gan Kim Yong,"To facilitate electricity imports, the Energy Market Authority will conduct an open and competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) process. Interested companies, including Sun Cable which initiated the Australia-Asia Power Link project, will need to participate in the RFP."
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00835,2021-11-03-T-049,835,Gan Kim Yong,"Imported electricity may or may not be more expensive than electricity produced in Singapore. It depends on several factors, including the distance of their source location and technology used, and other factors such as the cost of natural gas. The RFP process will ensure that we select bids that are cost-competitive and most suitable for Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-049-S-00836,2021-11-03-T-049,836,Gan Kim Yong,"As we advance in our energy transition, the Government will continue to work closely with our workforce, researchers, industries, and consumers, to achieve our goal of a cleaner, more efficient and secure energy future for Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00837,2021-11-03-T-050,837,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Prime Minister in light of the Pandora Papers leaks (a) whether the current regulations are sufficient to monitor or uncover any illicit activities of offshore financial service providers with offices registered in Singapore; (b) whether more stringent compliances are imposed on companies that violate the regulations; and (c) whether there will be a requirement for them to be repeatedly audited by independent parties for a defined period.
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00838,2021-11-03-T-050,838,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Mr Lawrence Wong, Deputy Chairman of MAS and Minister for Finance has responded to all the Parliamentary Questions (PQs) related to the recent disclosure by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)"
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00839,2021-11-03-T-050,839,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,(a)	Oral PQs from Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Patrick Tay filed for today’s Sitting;

2021-11-03-T-050-S-00841,2021-11-03-T-050,841,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,(c)	Oral PQ from Mr Murali Pillai filed for yesterday's Sitting.
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00842,2021-11-03-T-050,842,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As a global financial centre, Singapore intermediates a large volume of fund flows for investment or commercial purposes, and also provides services in financial asset management. While the vast majority of these activities are carried out by law-abiding individuals and companies, we are constantly on guard against the risk of illicit financing activities."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00843,2021-11-03-T-050,843,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) continually monitors and analyses information from a wide range of sources as part of its surveillance of money laundering and terrorism financing risks. This includes suspicious transactions reports filed by our financial institutions (FIs), information from intelligence sources, including those abroad, and publicly available information such as from independent investigations and media reports. MAS therefore takes seriously the recent disclosures in the Pandora Papers."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00844,2021-11-03-T-050,844,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The ICIJ has reported that 336 prominent individuals from around the world had established offshore structures to hold assets2, assisted by 14 service providers operating in at least 38 jurisdictions3. Two of the 14 service providers are foreign-incorporated trust companies with subsidiaries in Singapore that are licensed and regulated by MAS. Some ICIJ media reports also mentioned that many of these individuals had foreign bank accounts linked to these structures, in various financial centres including Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00845,2021-11-03-T-050,845,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Based on MAS’ assessment and information available thus far, the Pandora Papers have not raised significant concerns over the money laundering and counter terrorism financing (AML/CFT) controls of our FIs. Nevertheless, MAS is engaging the relevant FIs to assess if tightening of controls are warranted."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00846,2021-11-03-T-050,846,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As ICIJ itself is careful to acknowledge, there are legitimate reasons to set up offshore structures, such as for investment and estate management. However, offshore structures often lack transparency and are thus vulnerable to abuse for illicit activities. Hence, MAS has clear requirements for FIs in Singapore to identify and verify the identities of persons who are beneficial owners or effective controllers of their customer accounts. FIs must understand the reasons for the use of such structures, take measures to ascertain that the assets held in these structures are not illicit, and scrutinise any unusual transactions as part of their ongoing monitoring of the account."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00847,2021-11-03-T-050,847,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"MAS also supervises the FIs to ensure that their boards and management have implemented robust controls against money laundering and terrorism financing. Where there are breaches of AML/CFT requirements, MAS has taken strong enforcement action."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00848,2021-11-03-T-050,848,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"In fact, both the licensed trust companies in Singapore mentioned in the Pandora Papers have already been subject to MAS’ supervisory or enforcement actions. One of them, Asiaciti Trust (Singapore) Pte Ltd, paid a composition penalty of $1.1 million imposed by MAS in July last year for its failure to implement adequate AML/CFT policies and procedures. The other trust company, Trident Trust Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was directed by MAS in September last year to remediate weaknesses detected in its risk assessment controls during MAS’ supervisory surveillance. Both companies were under intensified scrutiny by MAS before they were mentioned in the Pandora Papers."
2021-11-03-T-050-S-00849,2021-11-03-T-050,849,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Let me assure this House that Singapore takes the integrity of our financial sector very seriously. As a major international financial centre, Singapore will always face the risk of illicit financial flows. What is important is that we supervise our FIs well, and take strong enforcement actions where necessary to reduce this risk as much as possible. MAS has been doing this and will continue to do so."
2021-11-03-T-051-S-00850,2021-11-03-T-051,850,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Home Affairs with the increase in deployment of surveillance technologies for crime prevention (a) how will the captured data be utilised; (b) how will the data be protected from theft or misuse; (c) whether there are specific physical areas where surveillance technologies will not be deployed to; and (d) how will the Ministry address the concerns of those who feel that their privacy is being invaded.
2021-11-03-T-051-S-00851,2021-11-03-T-051,851,K Shanmugam,"Police cameras (PolCams) are deployed in public places such as public residential estates, neighbourhood centres, hawker centres, commercial and entertainment districts, to deter and solve crimes. PolCams have helped the Police to solve more than 5,000 crimes since 2012 and surveys show that people feel safer with PolCams in their neighbourhood."
2021-11-03-T-051-S-00852,2021-11-03-T-051,852,K Shanmugam,"In the deployment of PolCams, the Police seek to address the broader interests of public safety and security, while respecting the privacy of private spaces. PolCams are therefore deployed at locations which only cover public spaces."
2021-11-03-T-051-S-00853,2021-11-03-T-051,853,K Shanmugam,"There are strict data protection safeguards and controls on the access and use of information obtained through PolCams. The data is securely stored and protected, and only authorised persons are given access. Any person found accessing the footage for unauthorised purposes will be severely dealt with."
2021-11-03-T-052-S-00854,2021-11-03-T-052,854,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry given the supply chain disruption and increase in energy costs, whether there will be any impact to food prices in the next six months."
2021-11-03-T-052-S-00855,2021-11-03-T-052,855,Gan Kim Yong,"The cost of food is affected by a combination of factors, including the imported prices, energy costs, freight, labour, and seasonal weather changes. Domestic food prices have risen in the past six months, due mainly to increased prices for global food commodities, higher energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortages."
2021-11-03-T-052-S-00856,2021-11-03-T-052,856,Gan Kim Yong,"We expect food prices to rise further in the coming months as energy prices, a contributor to the global cost of food, are expected to increase. Suppliers may need to adjust prices to reflect cost increases."
2021-11-03-T-052-S-00857,2021-11-03-T-052,857,Gan Kim Yong,"To mitigate the impact of higher food prices on families, the Government will continue to assist Singapore families in various ways. For example, MSF’s Social Service Offices (SSOs) provide ComCare assistance to low-income households to support their daily living expenses. The Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme has also helped less well-off Singaporeans with their household expenses during this period of economic uncertainty. Singapore will continue to diversify our import sources to keep prices competitive and enhance supply resilience."
2021-11-03-T-053-S-00858,2021-11-03-T-053,858,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in each of the past five years, how many cyclists have been booked for riding on a road on the right side of motor vehicles when not overtaking or not preparing to make a right turn; and (b) whether cyclists are allowed to ride on the lane to the right of a bus lane if there is no intention to overtake a vehicle on the bus lane or making a right turn."
2021-11-03-T-053-S-00859,2021-11-03-T-053,859,S Iswaran,I thank the Member for his question. I have addressed them in my reply to Question Nos 9 and 10 for written answer on the Order Paper for 2 November 2021 Parliament Sitting. [
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00860,2021-11-03-T-054,860,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Transport in light of the reduced public transport revenues in this COVID-19 pandemic times and rising expenditure costs (a) whether the Government is satisfied with the value of services in return for grants given out in the current model; and (b) whether the Ministry is looking into restructuring our public transport system, possibly exploring the merger of public transport operators to improve coordination and sustainability under current circumstances."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00861,2021-11-03-T-054,861,S Iswaran,"For the rail industry, LTA has been working closely with rail operators since 2011 to enhance rail reliability, which has exceeded our target of one million mean train kilometres between failures (MKBF) since 2019. These efforts have however come at a significant cost, especially as rail operating assets such as the signalling and power systems continue to age. As the fares paid by commuters are insufficient to cover operating costs, public transport operators have been registering losses for their rail operations even pre-COVID."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00862,2021-11-03-T-054,862,S Iswaran,"However, this is not sustainable. Public transport should be financially sustainable to ensure operators can continue to provide reliable train services to commuters. To support the operators in achieving and sustaining high reliability levels, we implemented an incentive system, termed the Rail Reliability Incentive, from 2020 to 2023. To qualify for the incentive, rail operators are held to a set of targets on operational performance and safety, including a minimum MKBF of 500,000 train kilometres. Operators obtain the full grant quantum if they achieve one million MKBF or better. As a result, we have seen the operators sustain their performance of above one million MKBF since 2019."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00863,2021-11-03-T-054,863,S Iswaran,"For the bus industry, the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) was introduced in 2016 to make bus services more responsive to commuter needs and to inject more competition into the industry. We do not provide targeted grants under BCM, but instead pay operators service fees to operate the bus services at required service levels. We have also introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework to incentivise bus operators to improve the timeliness of bus arrivals. Operators who meet the targets receive incentive payments, while operators who fail to do so will see their fees reduced."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00864,2021-11-03-T-054,864,S Iswaran,"Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, public transport ridership has fallen, and fare revenues have decreased sharply. Nevertheless, the operators have largely preserved service capacity and headways. In addition, public transport operators have incurred additional costs to put in place enhanced measures to keep commuters safe."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00865,2021-11-03-T-054,865,S Iswaran,"During this time, we have supported the operators through broad-based measures provided to affected businesses across different sectors, such as the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS). The grants given to the public transport operators have helped to ensure that our commuters, especially essential workers, can continue to travel to their workplaces, and arrive on time and safely."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00866,2021-11-03-T-054,866,S Iswaran,"Any changes to the industry models should be made with long term considerations in mind. We have to balance the value of competition with the benefits of economies of scale through consolidation. For the bus industry, the number of public transport operators has increased from two to four after the introduction of the BCM. The rail industry also now has two operators. The increased competition has spurred operators to improve service standards and submit more competitive tender bids."
2021-11-03-T-054-S-00867,2021-11-03-T-054,867,S Iswaran,"New travel patterns have emerged amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with flexible working arrangements becoming more common. We will continue to monitor how travel patterns evolve post-pandemic to assess the long-term impact on public transport ridership, and study if any adjustments are required to ensure financial sustainability as our public transport system continues to deliver high service standards."
2021-11-03-T-055-S-00868,2021-11-03-T-055,868,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the average licensing cost incurred by a non-hawker food and beverage establishment; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider waiving the costs for licence renewals (excluding liquor licences) for FY 2022 given the significant impact that COVID-19 has had on food and beverage outlets.
2021-11-03-T-055-S-00869,2021-11-03-T-055,869,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) licenses Food and Beverage (F&B) establishments including restaurants, coffee shops and food courts. Operators of F&B establishments are required to obtain a food shop licence from SFA, which costs $195 annually. Individual food stall operators obtain a food stall licence from SFA which costs $32 annually."
2021-11-03-T-055-S-00870,2021-11-03-T-055,870,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The cost of the licence is therefore insignificant. The Government is committed to supporting F&B establishments during this difficult period through significant support measures, such as the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Foreign Worker Levy rebates, rental waivers and rental reliefs for qualifying owner-occupiers and tenants under the Rental Relief Scheme (RRS)."
2021-11-03-T-056-S-00871,2021-11-03-T-056,871,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in the past two years, what are the instances that have necessitated sound barriers to be erected at construction sites; and (b) whether the Ministry will require sound barriers if a construction site is within 150 metres from noise-sensitive premises and residential buildings and has faced multiple complaints and breaches of permissible noise levels."
2021-11-03-T-056-S-00872,2021-11-03-T-056,872,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The regulations on construction noise under the Environmental Protection and Management Act strike a balance between enabling the development of needed infrastructure and keeping construction noise to a manageable level. The National Environment Agency (NEA) adopts an outcome-based approach by stipulating maximum permissible noise limits, rather than requiring specific measures that may not be suited for every site. This allows contractors to use the most cost-effective methods to meet the regulatory noise limits, including installing perimeter noise barriers. Construction sites closer to residential buildings and noise-sensitive premises would typically require more measures to meet the noise limits."
2021-11-03-T-056-S-00873,2021-11-03-T-056,873,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA takes strict enforcement action against contractors found to have exceeded the noise limits, which includes a fine of up to $40,000 per offence. NEA will continue to work with the construction industry to study measures to manage construction noise, taking into account international best practices and the local context."
2021-11-03-T-057-S-00874,2021-11-03-T-057,874,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) given the success of Project Wolbachia in the pilots in Chua Chu Kang, Yishun and Tampines, what are the plans to expand the project into other areas including residential and industrial estates; and (b) whether there have been any studies done on the long-term ecological impact related to the release of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and the decline of mosquito population in general."
2021-11-03-T-057-S-00875,2021-11-03-T-057,875,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Project
2021-11-03-T-057-S-00876,2021-11-03-T-057,876,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Project Wolbachia is being implemented using a phased approach to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the technology and assess deployment strategy. Thus far, we have achieved up to 98 per cent suppression of the primary mosquito vector of dengue and up to 88 per cent fewer dengue cases at pilot sites in Yishun, Tampines, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok."
2021-11-03-T-057-S-00877,2021-11-03-T-057,877,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"With the good results, the release of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has been expanded to more areas within Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok from October 2021. Releases at Tampines and Yishun will continue to be expanded and cover both towns entirely by the first quarter of 2022. Small-scale trials at landed residential estates in Marine Parade have also commenced in October 2021. Releases will be carried out at selected construction sites in Choa Chu Kang and Tampines as part of the strategy to test the technology in different terrains and landscapes. The results of these trials will inform the strategy for its future deployment in Singapore."
2021-11-03-T-058-S-00878,2021-11-03-T-058,878,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Education what changes can be made to the school curriculum so as to lessen the amount of homework given that may exacerbate stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 endemic.
2021-11-03-T-058-S-00879,2021-11-03-T-058,879,Chan Chun Sing,MOE is closely monitoring the disruptions to schooling caused by COVID-19 and has taken steps to ensure that students’ learning and well-being are not unduly compromised.
2021-11-03-T-058-S-00880,2021-11-03-T-058,880,Chan Chun Sing,"School leaders and teachers are mindful of the need for students to have a balanced life even during the pandemic, with adequate time for family bonding, personal interests and rest. They are therefore mindful of the need to keep homework load manageable. Every school has an established homework policy that addresses such needs, with school-based measures to manage and coordinate the amount of homework."
2021-11-03-T-058-S-00881,2021-11-03-T-058,881,Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond homework, there are also other sources of stress in students’ lives during the pandemic. By keeping schools open as far as possible, and ensuring that learning can still continue under Home-Based Learning (HBL) conditions, we provided students with a sense of normalcy and sustained social connections, which have been helpful to easing their anxieties."
2021-11-03-T-058-S-00882,2021-11-03-T-058,882,Chan Chun Sing,"When students return to school from extended HBL, the emphasis in schools is on checking on their well-being and curriculum recovery, and not on rushing to complete the syllabus or prepare for assessment. That is why we have cancelled the Primary 3 and Primary 4 year-end examinations and removed the Common Last Topics from national examinations. These decisions have also been helpful to safeguard students’ development and well-being."
2021-11-03-T-058-S-00883,2021-11-03-T-058,883,Chan Chun Sing,"Through these efforts, we seek to help our students cope with the stress and anxieties exacerbated by COVID-19 disruptions."
2021-11-03-T-059-S-00884,2021-11-03-T-059,884,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Education (a) out of the reported bullying incidents in primary and secondary schools in 2019 and 2020, how many cases involved the expulsion of the bully; (b) how many cases were resolved due to the victim transferring out of the school; and (c) whether there are any plans to better facilitate reporting of bullying cases in school."
2021-11-03-T-059-S-00885,2021-11-03-T-059,885,Chan Chun Sing,"Most incidences of bullying can be resolved through an educational and restorative approach. For students involved, their teachers help them learn from the incident, mend relationships and prevent further bullying. The goal is to address the underlying cause of the behaviour, and to change it. A range of corrective disciplinary actions is applied based on the age of offender and seriousness of offence to help students understand that their actions carry consequences."
2021-11-03-T-059-S-00886,2021-11-03-T-059,886,Chan Chun Sing,"The incidence of serious bullying incidences in school in 2019 and 2020 remained low, and those that result in student transfers or expulsions were even fewer. MOE does not centrally track the reason for transfers or expulsions."
2021-11-03-T-059-S-00887,2021-11-03-T-059,887,Chan Chun Sing,All students are taught safe channels for reporting bullying. Students may report them directly to their Principals. Every case will be investigated and followed up.
2021-11-03-T-060-S-00888,2021-11-03-T-060,888,Tan Wu Meng,asked  the
2021-11-03-T-060-S-00889,2021-11-03-T-060,889,Chan Chun Sing,"Our schools monitor the well-being of students affected by bereavement of a parent closely and provide support for those in need. When the school is informed of the bereavement, teachers will check in with and support the student as appropriate.  MOE does not track the number of students who suffered bereavement of a parent."
2021-11-03-T-060-S-00890,2021-11-03-T-060,890,Chan Chun Sing,"For students who have difficulty coping with grief and loss or exhibit emotional distress or social and behavioral changes, or when the next of kin requests for counselling support, teacher counsellors or school counsellors provide individual counselling to the students. They may also make referrals to community agencies such as Family Service Centres and Self-Help Groups to provide wraparound support to the students and their family."
2021-11-03-T-060-S-00891,2021-11-03-T-060,891,Chan Chun Sing,"Students who require financial support can apply for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), which covers school and standard miscellaneous fees, free textbooks and school uniforms, and transport and school meal subsidies. School-based financial assistance is also available to those who need additional support."
2021-11-03-T-061-S-00892,2021-11-03-T-061,892,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development since the launch of the 24-hour National Anti-Violence Helpline (NAVH) in January 2021 (a) what is the proportion of the calls which report (i) cases of violence between family members and (ii) cases of intimate partner violence between persons not in a familial relationship; and (b) what is the demographic of the callers of the helpline in terms of age group and gender.
2021-11-03-T-061-S-00893,2021-11-03-T-061,893,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The National Anti-Violence Helpline (NAVH) was officially launched in February 2021, although it had begun operations earlier on 18 January 2021. Since the start of the Helpline until end-September 2021, the NAVH has received 6,300 calls. Some of these were multiple calls concerning the same cases."
2021-11-03-T-061-S-00894,2021-11-03-T-061,894,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"About 30% of the calls were general enquiries, such as requests for information on services available or what constituted family violence. The remaining 70% of the calls were reports of alleged violence. Almost all the calls involved violence in a family setting. Calls relating to violence in non-family settings, including between unmarried intimate partners, constituted less than 1% of the calls."
2021-11-03-T-061-S-00895,2021-11-03-T-061,895,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The NAVH does not record administrative information of the callers, such as their age and gender, as the focus of the Helpline is to expeditiously attend to reports of violence, and provide advice or referral to relevant help services."
2021-11-03-T-062-S-00896,2021-11-03-T-062,896,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) with regard to subsidised hawker meals provided to recipients of the Public Assistance scheme through meal coupons or a Special Grant Card by Community Clubs and Citizen Consultative Committees, whether the scheme is still operational; (b) how many recipients did it benefit and how much was spent on it in each year since inception; and (c) whether this scheme can be expanded to keep hawker food affordable for the needy."
2021-11-03-T-062-S-00897,2021-11-03-T-062,897,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The subsidised hawker meals provided to recipients who show their Public Assistance/Special Grant Card
2021-11-03-T-062-S-00898,2021-11-03-T-062,898,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government supports households who require assistance with food-related needs in a number of ways. For instance, ComCare beneficiaries receive comprehensive support that includes cash assistance for food expenses. As part of the support to households affected by COVID-19, the Government2 issued grocery vouchers to eligible households to defray living expenses."
2021-11-03-T-062-S-00899,2021-11-03-T-062,899,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The community plays a strong complementary role with various initiatives. Through the cross-sector Charity Food Workgroup, the Government, community partners and corporates work together to enhance food support and coordination on the ground."
2021-11-03-T-063-S-00900,2021-11-03-T-063,900,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will work with the Ministry of Education to co-curate mental health-related modules in institutes of higher learning so that more mental health professionals can be produced to support our national mental health competency framework.
2021-11-03-T-063-S-00901,2021-11-03-T-063,901,Ong Ye Kung,"One of the recommendations of the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce (CoMWT) is to develop a National Mental Health Competency Training Framework, to align existing mental health trainings towards a common set of training standards and competencies expected of professionals and para-professionals who support persons with mental health conditions."
2021-11-03-T-063-S-00902,2021-11-03-T-063,902,Ong Ye Kung,"To implement this recommendation, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Education, and the Institute of Mental Health are developing the framework to guide mental health capability building for organisations across different sectors. Training providers such as Institutes of Higher Learning and Social Service Institute, may also develop mental health-related modules that are aligned to the training framework. More details on the framework will be provided when ready."
2021-11-03-T-064-S-00903,2021-11-03-T-064,903,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average number of monthly resignations of foreign medical professionals (nurses and doctors) in 2019, 2020 and 2021 (to date) respectively; and (b) whether this has affected the ability of the medical system to cope with the surge in COVID-19 cases."
2021-11-03-T-064-S-00904,2021-11-03-T-064,904,Ong Ye Kung,The question for written answer has been addressed by the Ministerial Statement delivered by Senior Minister of State for Health (on behalf of the Minister for Health) on 1 November 2021.
2021-11-03-T-065-S-00905,2021-11-03-T-065,905,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Government will work with the primary care network to establish a dedicated clinical pathway or referral to appropriate physical activity programmes for frail and pre-frail seniors; (b) whether the Healthy Ageing Promotion Programme for You (HAPPY) programme can be scaled up; and (c) whether and how primary care physicians, community nurses and the wider social community network can work together to identify and support the needs of community-dwelling frail seniors."
2021-11-03-T-065-S-00906,2021-11-03-T-065,906,Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Promotion Board (HPB) and healthcare clusters have put in place a variety of programmes to support seniors to stay active and prevent or delay functional decline. The Healthy Ageing Promotion Programme For You (HAPPY) programme is one such example. Since April 2019, the programme has been progressively rolled out at new sites islandwide, including the Eldercare Centres (ECs). It is now available at more than 110 locations. COVID-19 has disrupted the pace of roll out, but we plan to continue the scale-up to new sites as senior activities are able to gradually resume."
2021-11-03-T-065-S-00907,2021-11-03-T-065,907,Ong Ye Kung,"Within the community, primary care providers, healthcare clusters and community care providers are already working together to ensure that seniors receive the care they need. For example, the ECs link up seniors to care and social support services and ensure their medical issues are addressed and care provided is holistic and appropriate. Some of these sites are also supported by community nursing teams from the healthcare clusters. The community nurses provide a range of services such as health screening and coaching, falls and frailty assessment, chronic disease monitoring and caregivers’ education and training. They also refer the seniors to their regular primary care doctor if a medical consultation is needed and refer frail and pre-frail seniors for appropriate physical activity programmes based on their assessed needs and conditions."
2021-11-03-T-065-S-00908,2021-11-03-T-065,908,Ong Ye Kung,"The Silver Generation Office (SGO) actively reaches out to seniors at their homes, identify vulnerable seniors including those who are frail, and link them up to care and support services such as the community nursing teams for their healthcare needs and social agencies for the identified social needs."
2021-11-03-T-066-S-00909,2021-11-03-T-066,909,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many declarations, directives, orders and notices under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act have been issued since the enactment of the Act; and (b) what is the breakdown between the different Ministries."
2021-11-03-T-066-S-00910,2021-11-03-T-066,910,Josephine Teo,"There have been 32 instances of falsehoods spreading online where the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act was invoked. Of these, more than half (18) were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Where falsehoods are being spread on several web pages, posts, or platforms, several directions might be issued in a single instance."
2021-11-03-T-066-S-00911,2021-11-03-T-066,911,Josephine Teo,"Table 1 contains a breakdown of the number of directions issued by Ministries. All were directions for corrections to be put up, rather than to take down the falsehoods. In addition, four Facebook pages were made Declared Online Locations by the Ministry of Communications and Information, and were subsequently the subject of Access Disabling Orders. One website was the subject of an Access Blocking Order for failing to comply with a Correction Direction."
2021-11-03-T-067-S-00912,2021-11-03-T-067,912,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information since the enactment of the Prevention from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) (a) how many applications were received by the POFMA Office for variations, cancellations or suspensions of directions or remedial orders issued; (b) of these applications, how many were successful; and (c) how many resulted in an appeal being filed with the High Court."
2021-11-03-T-067-S-00913,2021-11-03-T-067,913,Josephine Teo,"Since POFMA was first invoked in November 2019, a total of 12 applications have been submitted – nine for cancellation of directions, and three for variation of directions. They constitute about 15% of all directions issued."
2021-11-03-T-067-S-00914,2021-11-03-T-067,914,Josephine Teo,"Two of the applications for variation were accepted, as they were unable to comply with the directions for technical reasons. Of the remaining 10, five did not appeal. Of the five appeals filed with the High Court, one was withdrawn, two are pending, and two have concluded after appealing further to the Court of Appeal."
2021-11-03-T-068-S-00915,2021-11-03-T-068,915,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether studies are being done on how pandemic vulnerability is shaped by urban design, demographics and movements of residents; and (b) if so, what are the findings to date and lessons for future urban planning."
2021-11-03-T-068-S-00916,2021-11-03-T-068,916,Desmond Lee,"We have always taken a holistic view towards urban planning, to provide a liveable and quality environment for all to live, work, and play in. This includes planning and designing a city that keeps its residents safe from various threats, including health-related ones. Beyond our immediate responses to managing the impact of COVID-19, we are also continually studying and reviewing the design of our environment and buildings to future-proof our city against public health threats, including pandemics."
2021-11-03-T-068-S-00917,2021-11-03-T-068,917,Desmond Lee,"While many of these studies are ongoing, current findings indicate the importance of adequate ventilation to mitigate airborne disease transmission risk. To this end, BCA already requires new developments and existing developments undergoing major addition and alteration works to be designed for adequate ventilation. For example, all naturally ventilated spaces are required to have a minimum area of openings (e.g. windows) to facilitate air flow. For air-conditioned spaces, buildings are required to take in outdoor air at a minimum rate specified in the Singapore Standard for air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) in buildings. In May 2020 and May 2021, taking into consideration lessons from COVID-19, BCA, NEA, and MOH issued guidelines for building managers to further improve ventilation and indoor air quality."
2021-11-03-T-068-S-00918,2021-11-03-T-068,918,Desmond Lee,"As another example, MOM, MND and MOH recently developed improved standards for new migrant worker dormitories to strengthen their resilience against future pandemics and enhance liveability. With these improved standards, dormitory rooms and toilets will have improved ventilation to reduce virus accumulation. For instance, new dormitories will need to include one exhaust fan per toilet and an adequate number of fans in dormitory rooms to ensure sufficient air circulation. The improved standards will also reduce intermixing amongst dormitory residents by modularising dormitory living and segmenting communal facilities."
2021-11-03-T-068-S-00919,2021-11-03-T-068,919,Desmond Lee,The Government will continue to study how to improve the planning and design of our environment to better mitigate against future pandemics.
2021-11-03-T-069-S-00920,2021-11-03-T-069,920,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are Singapore's source countries for sand imports; (b) what is the Ministry’s estimate of the size of the Singapore sand smuggling market; (c) whether there is a risk of countries banning sand sales to Singapore because there is significant smuggling or environmental damage from sand mining; and (d) whether the Government is considering not permitting commercial entities to import sand from jurisdictions with rampant illicit activity.
2021-11-03-T-069-S-00921,2021-11-03-T-069,921,Desmond Lee,"The import of sand for construction and reclamation purposes is done on a commercial basis, and sand is imported from various sources."
2021-11-03-T-069-S-00922,2021-11-03-T-069,922,Desmond Lee,"We do not condone any illegal trade or extraction of sand that breaches the source countries’ laws and regulations. Importers are expected to abide by the laws and regulations of the source countries. These include sourcing from legally permissible areas, and obtaining the proper export documentation and permits from relevant authorities in the source countries. Government contracts to import sand also include clauses mandating that contractors must comply with the laws and regulations of the source countries."
2021-11-03-T-069-S-00923,2021-11-03-T-069,923,Desmond Lee,"Thus far, we do not have evidence of illegal smuggling of sand into Singapore. The authorities will investigate all reports of illegal smuggling of sand, and take enforcement action against errant importers as necessary."
2021-11-03-T-070-S-00924,2021-11-03-T-070,924,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the criteria that HDB takes into account in considering to locate coffee shops or eateries within an HDB estate; and (b) whether such criteria include (i) the number of dwelling units (ii) proximity in terms of prescribed distance to other available eateries and (iii) availability and variety of eateries to cater to specific dietary requirements of residents such as vegetarian and halal fare.
2021-11-03-T-070-S-00925,2021-11-03-T-070,925,Desmond Lee,"HDB towns are designed to be self-sufficient with easy access to a wide range of facilities, including commercial facilities to meet the needs of residents."
2021-11-03-T-070-S-00926,2021-11-03-T-070,926,Desmond Lee,"HDB typically plans for a Town Centre at the heart of every HDB Town, to serve as the key commercial hub and provide a broad range of goods and services such as supermarkets, F&B outlets and retail shops. The Town Centre is complemented by neighbourhood centres that are distributed across the town. In selected precincts located further away from the Town Centre and neighbourhood centres, HDB will also build precinct shops which generally include an eating house, supermarket or minimart, and a few shops for the convenience of residents. Most residents will be able to access commercial facilities with a food court or eating house within 400 metres from their homes, or a walk of five to 10 minutes. The quantum of HDB commercial space provided depends on the number of dwelling units and the availability of similar facilities nearby."
2021-11-03-T-070-S-00927,2021-11-03-T-070,927,Desmond Lee,"To ensure that the eating houses provide a variety of food options for residents, HDB eating house operators are required to provide at least one halal food stall within their premises. HDB also observe that most eating houses already provide vegetarian options alongside other menu items."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00928,2021-11-03-T-071,928,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what measures are in place to identify youths who are isolated and spending a significant portion of their time at home; and (b) what schemes are in place to reach out and befriend them."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00929,2021-11-03-T-071,929,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Government recognises the importance of social support for our youths, and has put in place measures to identify and support the needs of youths who are isolated"
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00930,2021-11-03-T-071,930,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(a) In schools, teachers, counsellors, or student welfare officers identify youths who display worrying behaviours or show early signs of absenteeism. They check in on these students, conduct home visits if necessary, and work closely with their parents to ensure their well-being. School staff assess the students’ needs, and provide appropriate in-school support and referral to professional or community agencies. Peers also look out for one another, and check in on friends and classmates who are experiencing difficulties."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00931,2021-11-03-T-071,931,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(b) In the wider community, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care have set up youth community outreach teams to raise awareness on mental health, and to provide basic emotional support and resources to youths in mental distress. The outreach encourages youths to step forward to seek support, and family members to support the home environment of the youths."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00932,2021-11-03-T-071,932,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(c) MSF collaborates with Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to address the needs of these youths and their families. SSAs provide a range of youth-centric activities such as sports, performing arts and adventure activities, and drop-in centres to engage youths meaningfully. SSAs may link youths and their families to relevant services for additional support, including mental health resources or financial assistance. In cases where youths require urgent intervention, SSAs will conduct home visits to check in on the youths and work with their families to manage conflicts. Should there be safety concerns for these youths, SSAs will consult and refer to MSF Child Protective Service."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00933,2021-11-03-T-071,933,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Government and the community also leverages digital platforms to reach youths.
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00934,2021-11-03-T-071,934,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(a) During Circuit Breaker in 2020, the National Youth Council (NYC) launched MehGoWhere, an online site that provided youths with resources, coping tips and online activities to stay connected. This has transitioned into Youthopia, a first-stop portal providing youth-centric content, including mental health resources such as tips on self-coping and resilience, as well as information on community events for them to connect with like-minded individuals."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00935,2021-11-03-T-071,935,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(b) The SSAs engage youths online to impart important values and life skills, such as through Instagram live chats. Youths may also access online counselling services, such as eC2 by Fei Yue Community Services and e-counselling services by Limitless."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00936,2021-11-03-T-071,936,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Additional measures to strengthen the social support networks of youths include the following
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00937,2021-11-03-T-071,937,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(a) Youths can take part in meaningful volunteering activities organised by Youth Corps Singapore and the People’s Association (PA) Youth Networks, through which they can meet peers and contribute to their communities together. In doing so, they are also expanding networks that are vital for social resilience. Youths can also participate in town and community-level initiatives by the SG Cares Volunteer Centres."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00938,2021-11-03-T-071,938,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(b) We partner youth enterprises such as Friendzone, to organise regular online community events where youths can bond with others in their neighbourhoods."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00939,2021-11-03-T-071,939,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(c) We also recognise that youths can benefit from the support and guidance from those who are more experienced. To this end, the National Youth Council (NYC) and Mentoring Alliance Singapore (MASg) launched the Mentoring Alliance for Action (AfA), to provide youths with greater access to mentors that can help them navigate life’s challenges and difficulties."
2021-11-03-T-071-S-00940,2021-11-03-T-071,940,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Supporting our youths requires everyone – Government, the community, families, and friends, to play a role. Let us continue to extend kindness and support to those who need help, so that we can overcome the challenges of COVID-19 together."
2021-11-03-T-072-S-00941,2021-11-03-T-072,941,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower for each year in the past five years (a) how many workers were repatriated on the same day that their work permit was cancelled; (b) how many workers have been repatriated within a week from when their work permit is cancelled; and (c) what is the median number of days a worker is repatriated following the cancellation of the worker’s work permit.
2021-11-03-T-072-S-00942,2021-11-03-T-072,942,Tan See Leng,"MOM does not compile the statistics requested by the Member. We typically give employers up to 14 days to repatriate their work permit holders after the work permit is cancelled. In our Settling-In-Programme for new migrant workers, they are briefed that if they are being repatriated but have pending employment-related claims against their employer, they should inform officers at the immigration checkpoints, who will refer them to MOM. MOM will allow the worker to remain in Singapore to settle his claims and facilitate a transfer to a new employer if the worker would like to continue working in Singapore. MOM will also proactively reach out to construction workers whose permits have been cancelled to put them on the retention scheme jointly set up with the Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL). The retention scheme is being progressively expanded to include the Marine Shipyard and Process sectors, jointly with industry partners."
2021-11-03-T-073-S-00943,2021-11-03-T-073,943,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower for each year in the past five years (a) how many cases of wrongful dismissal were lodged by work permit holders; and (b) how many of such cases have been (i) resolved at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (ii) referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) but eventually dismissed (iii) referred to ECT and resulted in the reinstatement of employees' former job and payment of any income loss due to the wrongful dismissal and (iv) referred to ECT and resulted in money orders in favour of the employees, respectively."
2021-11-03-T-073-S-00944,2021-11-03-T-073,944,Tan See Leng,"There were 42 wrongful dismissal claims lodged by Work Permit Holders in 2020, out of a total of 1,319 such claims lodged by all employees. About 60% (26) of these claims were resolved at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, while the remaining 16 were referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT). Of the cases referred to the ECT, 11 were dismissed or withdrawn, one did not lodge the claim, and another was adjourned. The remaining three cases resulted in money orders for the claimant."
2021-11-03-T-074-S-00945,2021-11-03-T-074,945,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Manpower in light of existing restrictions on the entry of new migrant domestic workers (MDWs), whether there has been any tracking of employer types and market salaries for the existing pool of MDWs."
2021-11-03-T-074-S-00946,2021-11-03-T-074,946,Tan See Leng,86% of existing MDWs in Singapore were hired by households with caregiving needs.
2021-11-03-T-074-S-00947,2021-11-03-T-074,947,Tan See Leng,"As shared in Parliament previously, the average monthly salary of a new MDW hired from overseas was $590 as at the end of 2020. As at September 2021, this was $620. On the average, transfer MDWs are paid about $40 more than new MDWs."
2021-11-03-T-075-S-00948,2021-11-03-T-075,948,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are efforts made to encourage companies to send their professionals for training to develop their mental health competencies and be their organisation's resource person at work.
2021-11-03-T-075-S-00949,2021-11-03-T-075,949,Tan See Leng,The Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces contains information of some workplace mental well-being training service providers that organisations can consider.
2021-11-03-T-075-S-00950,2021-11-03-T-075,950,Tan See Leng,"In promoting adoption of the Tripartite Advisory, we try to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. Formal training and the creation of a resource person may work for larger companies, but is less relevant or practical for SMEs. Even if an organisation is not able to designate at least one of its staff to be trained, it is still possible to consider implementing the other practical recommendations in the advisory."
2021-11-03-T-075-S-00951,2021-11-03-T-075,951,Tan See Leng,"To further encourage companies to send their representatives for trainings to build up mental health competencies, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council and Health Promotion Board (HPB) have programmes that include mental well-being support. These are offered for free or at highly subsidised rates. Under the Total WSH Programme, providers work with companies to run interventions to address the safety and health gaps holistically, where mental well-being topics are included. Similarly, HPB’s Workplace Outreach Wellness (WOW) package includes mental well-being programmes that strengthen workplace support for employees and help employees manage stress as well as build mental resilience."
