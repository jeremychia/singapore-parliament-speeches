2022-01-10-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health what is the impact from the emergence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant on the plans for Singapore to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, in terms of the timelines for reopening the economy and permitting more social and cultural activities involving the gatherings of people.",1,14,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00014
2022-01-10-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry has plans to apply vaccination-differentiated measures to children aged between five and 11.,1,15,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00015
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, as the first Member to speak in the first Parliamentary Sitting of the year, may I just wish all Members and Speaker a good 2022 ahead.",1,16,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00016
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I address Question Nos 1 to 12 and also written Question Nos 34 to 38 in the Order Paper, please?",2,17,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00017

2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary and Minister Chan Chun Sing will then address another set of questions on child vaccination. May I request that we deliver our replies and then all three of us take supplementary questions together, please?",1,19,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00019
2022-01-10-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,20,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00020
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore just weathered a significant COVID-19 transmission wave caused by the Delta variant which is still active in many parts of the world.",1,21,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00021
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"By working together, making collective sacrifices to restrain our social interactions, watching out for one another and implementing sound policies, we have overcomed perhaps the most difficult part of the pandemic.",2,22,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00022
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As of now, our hospital situation is stable, with 11 COVID-19-related ICU cases. Most activities have resumed and we are meeting up with friends and loved ones. Our society has become much more resilient to COVID-19 than before. This is an important milestone.",3,23,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00023
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But a new Omicron wave is upon us. If we work together, we can ride through the wave. Once we have done so, we will be even more resilient than now and even more prepared to live with COVID-19.",4,24,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00024
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When Omicron first burst onto the global scene, we immediately introduced measures, such as restricting travel from affected countries in Africa, enhancing testing for all travellers, isolating cases in hospitals and reinstating stringent contact tracing and quarantine for Omicron infections.",5,25,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00025
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"These measures will not stop Omicron from taking root and spreading in Singapore, given its high transmissibility. However, they have helped to delay its emergence, giving us precious time to understand it better and to prepare ourselves.",6,26,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00026
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The characteristics of Omicron have now become clearer. This is what we know today. There are three key points.,7,27,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00027
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, local and overseas evidence shows that it is far more transmissible than the Delta variant. We must expect a wave that could be a few times larger than the Delta wave. So, if Delta infections reached a sustained incidence of about 3,000 cases a day, Omicron could perhaps reach 10,000 to 15,000 cases a day or even more. Cases are likely to double every two to three days. So, once cases start to rise steeply, within a couple of weeks, we may see 3,000 Omicron cases a day.",8,28,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00028
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, there has been consistent international evidence showing that Omicron infections are less severe than Delta. The incidence of hospitalisation and severe illness is lower and there are also indications that any hospital stays are also shorter. Indeed, the clinical outcomes, particularly the number of people who become severely ill or die, are much more important than the top line number of infection cases.",9,29,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00029
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I show a couple of slides on screen, just to illustrate this clearly?",10,30,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00030
2022-01-10-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please. [",1,31,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00031
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. This graph describes the situation in South Africa. The blue line shows number of infections. Members can see three humps, reflecting the three waves that they have gone through  the first is Beta, then Delta in the middle, and the latest, the tallest is Omicron. And it is plotted against the scale on the left axis. The grey part for the top graph shows hospitalisations, plotted against the scale on the right axis. And so, Members can see that in the latest wave, the number of hospitalisations is proportionately lower than the previous two waves.",1,32,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00032
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The bottom graph is even more stark. The red area shows number of deaths, plotted against a separate scale on the right axis. Members can see that during the Omicron wave, the red area is actually very small; number of deaths is, proportionately, much lower than the previous two waves.",2,33,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00033
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The next slide is a similar analysis but, now, it is for the UK. Members can see a similar pattern  proportionately fewer hospitalisations and fewer deaths.",3,34,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00034
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A study by health authorities in South Africa showed that 4.9% of cases were admitted to hospitals during the Omicron wave, compared to 13.7% during the Delta wave. Amongst the patients admitted to hospital during the Omicron wave, they were 73% less likely to have severe disease.",4,35,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00035
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the UK, the risk of being admitted to hospital or emergency care with Omicron was about half that of Delta.",5,36,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00036
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Data from Denmark also showed that about 0.8% of Omicron cases were hospitalised, lower than the 1.2% rate of hospitalisation among cases infected with other variants.",6,37,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00037
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This has also been borne out by our own local experience. In Singapore, we have recorded 4,322 Omicron infections so far, including 308 seniors aged 60 and above. Eight of the 4,322 needed oxygen supplementation, and all of them have been taken off oxygen after a short few days. None required ICU care as yet.",7,38,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00038
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In comparison, if these 4,322 infections had instead been caused by Delta, we would expect 50 to 60 patients needing oxygen supplementation, ICU care or to die.",8,39,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00039
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, we should be careful in interpreting these observations. It is early days and the circumstances of each country are different. South Africa, for example, has a young population and a high level of natural immunity, even though their vaccination coverage is low.",9,40,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00040
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The UK has both high levels of vaccination and natural immunity, and this current Omicron outbreak is riding on the back of a protracted Delta outbreak, which worsens clinical outcomes.",10,41,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00041
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Further, Omicron transmits much faster and infects more people. So, even if a small percentage of infected individuals falls very sick, because of the large base of infections, it can still lead to many people needing ICU care or die.",11,42,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00042
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The third thing we have found out about Omicron is that vaccines, especially boosters, retain substantial protection against severe disease. Indeed, the most recent studies in the UK found that for vaccinated individuals, the risk of hospitalisation for Omicron is reduced by 72%, compared to the unvaccinated. With a booster shot, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation is estimated to be 88%.",12,43,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00043
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, Omicron has spread to over 130 countries and has become the dominant strain in many places. Hence, we lifted the suspension of flights from affected African countries and aligned the healthcare protocols between Omicron and other COVID-19 variants.",13,44,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00044
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Members would like to know our strategy in responding to the Omicron wave.,14,45,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00045
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Given that it is less severe than the Delta variant and vaccines still work against it, our key objective remains, which is, to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease. Then, we can lead life as normally as possible and continue to build a bright future for Singapore and our children.",15,46,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00046
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"That includes not locking down our borders, which will inflict tremendous pain on families, workers, businesses and also the mental well-being of many people. In any case, a severe lock-down strategy will likely delay but not prevent the inevitability of Omicron finding its way into our community.",16,47,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00047
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,There are two factors working in our favour.,17,48,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00048
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, a high percentage of our population is vaccinated and more are getting their boosters every day.",18,49,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00049
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, unlike many European countries which have to contend with a double whammy of a concurrent Delta and Omicron wave, we have only recently gone through a Delta wave. We are not likely to have to ride through two rapidly rising infection waves.",19,50,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00050
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In recent days, our overall local infection number is creeping up, to a few hundred a day, with Omicron accounting for about 40% of all cases. Given the transmissibility of Omicron, we expect the numbers to rise steeply in the coming weeks and Omicron will become the dominant variant within a few weeks.",20,51,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00051
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The responses that we have developed against Delta will continue to be relevant against Omicron, with some adjustments. And there are three responses, essentially.",21,52,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00052
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, vaccination and boosters remain key. In countries where Omicron has spread, the unvaccinated and under-vaccinated are still the most prone to falling seriously ill when infected.",22,53,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00053
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Dennis Tan asked for a breakdown of COVID-19 deaths. There were 802 such deaths in 2021, of whom 555 were not fully vaccinated. Although the unvaccinated is a small proportion of our population, they contributed to 70% of the deaths in 2021.",23,54,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00054
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The remaining 247 were vaccinated with a range of locally available vaccines. I am going to read out some crude incidence rates but be mindful we are calculating these based on quite a small sample of 247 deaths of individuals who are vaccinated. They are as follows  79 deaths per 100,000 for non-fully vaccinated persons overall; 11 deaths per 100,000 for those vaccinated with Sinovac; 7.8 per 100,000 for Sinopharm; 6.2 per 100,000 for Pfizer-BioNTech and one per 100,000 for Moderna.",24,55,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00055
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"These rates are only indicative – as I mentioned, the sample size is small and they also do not account for other factors which may affect mortality, such as the age and timing of vaccination.",25,56,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00056
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Around 132,000 individuals aged 18 and above remain unvaccinated, while around 300 persons are medically ineligible. We will continue to try to convince those who are medically eligible to get vaccinated, through their primary care physicians, public messaging and the media. But as Members would appreciate, as the number gets smaller, it is also harder and harder to convince them.",26,57,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00057
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For those who are homebound, our Mobile Vaccination Teams can visit their homes to vaccinate them.",27,58,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00058
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past months, we have managed to vaccinate well over 90% of every eligible age group. It is quite an achievement. We are especially happy to see that amongst seniors aged 60 to 69, and 70 and above, 96% and 95% have been fully vaccinated respectively.",28,59,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00059
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for those aged 12 to 19 years, 95% are fully vaccinated. For the even younger ones aged five to 11, we have just started vaccinating them. The response has been good and operations smooth.",29,60,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00060
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"At this time, only the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine is authorised for use in ages below 18 years. We will continue to closely monitor the availability of other non-mRNA vaccines that are approved for use in children.",30,61,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00061
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"At the same time, our vaccine booster programme is gathering pace. About 46% of our population has received their boosters. We have recently brought some 900,000 individuals aged 18 to 29 into the booster programme, of whom 700,000 are already eligible to receive their boosters today. Our booster coverage will continue to expand over the month of January.",31,62,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00062
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We have also set a validity period for full vaccination status of 270 days, as a strong signal to our population, ""Please get your boosters promptly"".",32,63,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00063
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As to whether there is a need for further booster shots – fourth shot, fifth shot – it is too early to tell. Today, Israel is the only country that has authorised a fourth dose for non-immunocompromised individuals.",33,64,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00064
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For an endemic infectious disease like influenza, we can draw some inference from there. This virus mutates frequently, so, people receive vaccinations every year to protect themselves against it, without many problems or the need for disruptive border closures and social restrictions each time there is an influenza infection wave. It is a possible future scenario when we live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease.",34,65,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00065
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MOH and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) will continue to monitor local and international data on the durability of protection from vaccine boosters and the evolution of the virus to assess the need for further vaccinations.,35,66,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00066
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second response  we continue to enhance our healthcare capacity. We have made preparations to ramp up capacity and manpower of the Home Recovery Programme, Community Treatment Facilities (CTFs) and public hospitals. We stand ready to provide up to 350 ICU beds, 2,000 isolation beds and 4,000 CTF beds for COVID-19 cases with a couple of weeks’ notice.",36,67,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00067
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Particularly, for hospital ICU capacity, existing single rooms and isolation rooms can be repurposed into additional ICU beds when required. Medical equipment and consumables are ready. Manpower is always a limiting factor, but ICU staff has increased by 12% over the past year to about 1,800 now and we have trained or are training about 500 more staff to assist with ICU operations.",37,68,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00068
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Anti-viral medications for COVID-19 have been used to treat vulnerable patients who are at high risk of falling severely ill. When authorised for use and made available in Singapore, these oral anti-viral medications will be important additions to the range of COVID-19 therapeutic agents already in use locally. We have signed or are negotiating supply agreements for these medications but, unfortunately, I am not at liberty to release details due to confidentiality obligations in these contracts.",38,69,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00069
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Outside of the hospitals, we will be enhancing our health protocols to right-site patients, so that hospital resources go to those who need them most. The MTF has recently announced our partnership with primary care doctors to care for patients who are recovering at home after being tested positive with Antigen Rapid Tests, under what we termed Protocol 2. This will help them safely recover and return to normal activities as soon as possible.",39,70,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00070
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I should caution Members against thinking that coping with a transmission wave successfully is a matter of recruiting more healthcare workers and building more ICU facilities. Our objective is not to have more people falling very sick and admitted to ICU but, in fact, to avoid it.",40,71,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00071
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, we size our emergency healthcare capacity based on what is sustainable and practical. Bearing in mind this is a crisis of a generation, the capacity needed cannot be provided within our redundancy provision and ICU-trained staff do not just increase multi-fold overnight or even over a few months. Hence, we have tried to temper the infection numbers through safe management measures and exercising self-restraint in our social interactions.",41,72,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00072
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, vaccinations, expansion of healthcare capacity, and safe management measures – the three must work in tandem and we must strike a balance among the three factors.",42,73,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00073
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We cannot, for example, over-liberalise, remove all social restrictions, let infections rise uncontrollably and leave the healthcare system to bear the consequences. Neither do we swing to the other extreme  protect the healthcare system at all costs, go for a zero-COVID-19 strategy and lock down our borders and society which will cause tremendous suffering to our people.",43,74,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00074
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"How the three factors balance off one another is a matter of judgement, depending on the pandemic situation. It will be too rigid to set metrics and parameters to trigger social restrictions, as we need to respond flexibly and appropriately to the twists and turns that the pandemic situation may take.",44,75,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00075
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This brings us to the third response, which is safe management measures. In recent months, instead of imposing across-the-board social restrictions, we introduced more vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS).",45,76,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00076
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is because unvaccinated individuals are at far higher risk of falling severely ill. This group has consistently taken up two-thirds of our ICU beds, throughout the pandemic. By restricting their social interactions, we protect them against infections and serious illnesses and taking up hospital resources. The rest of society who have been vaccinated can also then live life more normally.",46,77,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00077
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, there are, presently, no plans to introduce VDS for children aged 12 and below in community, public, preschool and school settings. This is due to a combination of reasons, namely, children are less likely to develop severe illnesses when infected and we want to preserve as much as possible universal access to holistic education for children. Minister Chan will explain further.",47,78,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00078
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For now, children aged 12 and below who are Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass Holders and did not travel recently will continue to have their COVID-19 medical bills fully covered by the Government. This is regardless of their vaccination status.",48,79,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00079
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, in general, while we have a strict VDS system in place, to enable society to carry on normal lives as much as possible while protecting the unvaccinated, the rules are much less strict on children, based on the reasons I have explained earlier.",49,80,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00080
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Members asked if we are likely to tighten up social activities because of the Omicron wave. When the Delta wave subsided late last year, we refrained from being too jubilant and over relaxing restrictions. That would have been a mistake. We kept our masking requirements, we did not allow night entertainment to restart, we kept group sizes at five.",50,81,2022-01-10-T-002-S-00081
2022-01-10-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, it is the MTF’s hope that we can ride through the Omicron wave with the current safe management measures posture.

Omicron is a different enemy, but we are much better prepared and much more resilient than before. And after the Omicron wave passes, which it will, we would have taken another huge step towards living with COVID-19.

The take-up so far has been encouraging. As of 7 January, about 123,000 children aged five to 11 have received at least one dose of the vaccine or booked their vaccination appointments.",2,90,2022-01-10-T-003-S-00090

Fortunately, as of 8 January 2022, none of these children remained hospitalised. Although fewer children have been seriously ill with COVID-19 compared to adults, there is still a risk of them becoming seriously ill or developing severe COVID-19 complications, such as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Since mid-October 2021, we have observed several serious cases of COVID-19 in children, with some requiring intensive care.",3,91,2022-01-10-T-003-S-00091

The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination for children has been assessed by HSA and our own Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) to be safe. The assessment is corroborated by international data.,4,92,2022-01-10-T-003-S-00092

The incidence of myocarditis, which is what many parents are most concerned about, is about one in a million doses. The children reported with myocarditis following vaccination had either recovered or were recovering at the time of the report. Vaccination will allow our children to be protected against the disease and reduce the likelihood of infecting others, including vulnerable or elderly family members. On the other hand, the incidence of myocarditis amongst individuals aged 12 to 17 infected with COVID-19, is about 45 per 100,000 infections.

2022-01-10-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The first pertains to a subject I believe that was covered both by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education. This concerns the apprehension some parents have over the administration of mRNA vaccines for their children. These parents anecdotally are not anti-vax per se. Some of them may have taken the mRNA vaccine on their own, but the concern is really a visceral one, that is, about the long-term effects, the fact that this vaccine is referred for emergency approvals and so forth, even though I think some have been granted FDA approval, Pfizer-BioNTech specifically.",2,112,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00112
2022-01-10-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To that extent, will MOH allow such parents to wait until non-mRNA traditional protein-based vaccines are approved for their children's inoculation, so as to give them more choices and to assuage their concerns?",3,113,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00113
2022-01-10-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question follows. I understand that one such non-mRNA vaccine company, Novavax, submitted data for approval under Singapore's Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) on 22 November. The Director of Medical Services confirmed a few days ago, on 5 January, that he was very optimistic Novavax would be authorised as a non-mRNA booster. My question is, if Novavax or any other non-mRNA vaccine maker has submitted data for the authorisation for use for children above the age of 12, and, if so, when can these vaccines be expected to be introduced in the National Vaccination Programme?",4,114,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00114
2022-01-10-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Just a very short follow-through on that  with regard to the point made by the Minister for Health on the 270 days that are required, the limit before you take a booster and then to be recognised still as being vaccinated, would there be some flexibility to allow Novavax at least to get on this programme and to allow more individuals to then be considered fully vaccinated?",5,115,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00115
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. I can fully appreciate parents' concern about mRNA vaccines for children. They will be concerned about the long-term effects and whatever side effects there may be. Just a few facts. The children's vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, has gone through extensive clinical trials. And during the clinical trials, it was proven and shown to be safe and effective.",1,116,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00116
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Specifically, myocarditis, which is what most parents are concerned about in children, it occurred. Currently, there are about 8.5 million already vaccinated in the US and the incidence rate is about one in a million. And as Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary mentioned, we have to balance this against the downside of getting infection. If you are infected, the chances of myocarditis are 45 in a million and also other effects, such as MIS-C, which can make the child really sick. [Please refer to “Clarification by Minister for Health”, Official Report, 10 January 2022, Vol 95, Issue 44, Clarification section.] And we have seen a handful, one or two a week, when Delta was at its peak and they are admitted to ICU.

2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the question of Novavax, it is being assessed by HSA. We need to let the scientists do their work. I think we should consider putting it into our National Vaccination Programme. We have always wanted a good portfolio of mRNA and non-mRNA vaccines. But, as for the timing, I think it may take a while more, including for delivery, plus another process for assessing whether it is suitable for children, there is another set of data, another set of trials. So, I do not know how long it would take.",6,121,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00121

So, I would suggest, as Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary has advised, get your child vaccinated with mRNA, given the circumstances. It is not perfect, but I think, given the circumstances, cause and benefits, the right thing to do now is to get your child vaccinated as quickly as possible.",7,122,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00122
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Likewise, for the 270 days, I can understand what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting – whether we should wait for Novavax. But again, Omicron is upon us. While I hope we have the luxury of time to wait for a non-mRNA vaccine to be available, but, with the impending Omicron wave, I think we should act quickly and, therefore, we set the validity period of 270 days.",8,123,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00123

My supplementary question is for Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary. Some young children may have undetected medical conditions and, especially allergies, if their parents do not send them for non-mandatory medical reviews. As such, I wish to ask whether MOH would advise all young children to undergo a medical review before going ahead with the COVID-19 vaccination. This is similar to how some adults with underlying medical conditions are advised to get clearance from the doctor in the early stages of the vaccination drive.",1,125,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00125
2022-01-10-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his question. The answer is partly in the last line that he stated, which is, that we took that approach in the early stages of the adult vaccination drive because, at that time, the amount of data that we had was less and the amount of experience that we had was less. Now we know a lot more about both the disease as well as the vaccination, including in children.",1,126,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00126
2022-01-10-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, the approach for children is not so different from adults. If they have an underlying condition – and there is a list that the doctor will know about it – then some review needs to happen. But if the child is otherwise healthy, then the recommendation is to proceed with the COVID-19 vaccination.",2,127,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00127
2022-01-10-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The issue of allergies is slightly different in that, for any drug, you cannot necessarily tell whether an allergy will happen or not happen on the basis of prior underlying conditions. Hence, the team at the site of the vaccination is trained to then detect and deal with the rare allergies that do happen. And again, our experience with COVID-19 is, it does not happen any differently from other vaccinations that we are giving to children on a regular basis.",3,128,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00128

The Government has been encouraging the use of ART swabbing to prevent the spread of viruses. However, in many situations, self-reporting of ART results is not allowed. Instead, people are required to conduct the test only at approved testing centres, which not only costs more but is more inconvenient. Can we move to a regime where people are trusted to accurately report the ART results, just like how it is done in schools and, indeed, here in Parliament? This will reduce the cost for many people and make administrative procedures at events more efficient.",1,131,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00131
2022-01-10-T-004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Second question  there is a tendency for some activities to be prohibited, even though the transmission risk is low. Can the lead agencies issue more specific advisories to organisations based on the actual prevailing risk of viral spread, so that we move closer on the path towards normalcy?",2,132,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00132
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you for those suggestions. Relying on individuals to self-report ART results, this, as Mr Gerald Giam has acknowledged, is actually in place. It is not quite in Parliament because you do get informed by an SMS that you are negative. But there are many settings where we do rely on self-reporting. Workplace, for example, a lot of meetings, events you go to, you do a self-test.",1,133,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00133
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We have an entire protocol, what we call a protocol tool, that is based on self-testing – that you self-test and, if you are positive, you stay home for 72 hours. After that, daily tests and only when you are negative, you come out. It is totally an honesty-based system. If you are negative, you come out; and if you are positive, you stay at home.",2,134,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00134
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, the answer is, yes, we very much support what Mr Gerald Giam has said and it is already in place. Can we do more? We are doing more. You will notice that, recently, MOH announced that we are now working with GPs and primary care-providers. Previously, we could see a primary care-provider or a GP and when you say you are sick, he can only prescribe you a PCR test, which will be taken to a lab and reported by the lab. But now, he can also prescribe you an ART test. Essentially, he can trigger Protocol 2.",3,135,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00135
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, we are moving in that direction. And I must say that, to overcome this crisis, it is really not just the Government, but it requires the cooperation, civic-mindedness and sense of self-responsibility of every individual in our population.",4,136,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00136
2022-01-10-T-004,,,"The next question is more specific  rules on different settings. That is what we have been doing, too. If the Member has any specific suggestion on specific settings, we would be happy to hear them and we are constantly tweaking them. But just one word of caution. Sometimes, when you tweak more, it becomes more complicated and people do compare  ""Why is it for this setting I am allowed to do this? Why is it for that setting I am not allowed?"" And you start to have invidious comparisons and people start to get confused. So, we are also very mindful to keep rules as simple as possible because simplicity is an essential ingredient for people to exercise self-responsibility. What they do not understand, they cannot self-enforce.",1,137,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00137

2022-01-10-T-004,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"Mr Speaker, I have two questions for the Minister for Health. One is regarding a question that I raised in my Parliamentary Question (PQ) which is yet to be answered. With quite a significant proportion of Omicron coming from imported cases, I had asked the Minister for a breakdown by country of origin of imported COVID-19 Omicron cases. So, if the Minister for Health could shed some light on that.",1,141,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00141
2022-01-10-T-004,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"My second question relates to his answer that boosters have shown to increase protection against infection and severe illness, including Omicron, substantially; whether MOH will contemplate imposition of booster jab as a requirement for VTL travellers, beyond the current requirement of two jabs only and that would be deemed as vaccinated. So, whether we will bump up the requirement to a booster jab.",2,142,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00142
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I must apologise to the Member. I did not mean to drop her question but it will be addressed by Minister Iswaran later in the next set of questions, especially on the specific breakdown on the number of imported cases.",1,143,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00143
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for booster jabs, it is a serious issue that the Member has raised because we do know that two doses do not last forever. The EU has already implemented a guideline which is similar to ours  nine months' validity or 270 days. So, I think the world will converge towards some form of validity, I believe, and, naturally, this will become a requirement in due course. That is my conjecture.",2,144,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00144

I thank the Minister for confirming earlier that there will be no vaccination-differentiated measures for children in schools who do not get vaccinated.",1,146,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00146
2022-01-10-T-004,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"My question, however, is whether there should be activities beyond school, perhaps, say, if and when the National School Games should commence or if there are national-level sporting or athletic activities that will involve children aged five to 11, would there be possibly vaccination-differentiated measures implemented then. For example, would there be a position that might say if young children are not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated, they would not be allowed to participate in these events?",2,147,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00147
2022-01-10-T-004,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I ask also primarily because, sometimes, the results of these events for the children – the timings, their performances and so on, especially for those in Primary 6 this year – could be relevant and important in the application for Secondary schools under Direct School Admission (DSA).",3,148,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00148
2022-01-10-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may, let me explain our thinking at this point in time. Of course, I caveat that by saying that whatever our considerations current at this point in time will, subsequently, have to take into account the prevailing national posture and also the development of the virus and its mutation.",1,149,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00149
2022-01-10-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At this point in time, we would very much like to have all our children be able to attend school and participate in as many of the core activities as much as possible. Having said that, of course, there are also activities beyond the core curriculum that may pose a higher risk to our students. And for those higher-risk activities, we will then have to consider if differentiated measures will be required.",2,150,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00150
2022-01-10-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For example, at this point in time, we have already put in place some additional measures for some of these activities that the students are participating in and these apply to our Secondary, JC and MI students. Just to give an example. Today, if they do team sports under the pilot, only the fully vaccinated students who have taken an onsite ART will be allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10. For some other students who are participating in the band or the choir, they would also have to take some other additional measures to safeguard themselves and their fellow participants.",3,151,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00151
2022-01-10-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, this is how we will go about considering the participation of our students in some of these particularly higher-risk activities in the sense that they have a higher-risk of transmission. But as far as possible, we would like to have our students participate in the core curriculum all together because this adds to their overall social emotional development beyond their academic development.",4,152,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00152

2022-01-10-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just have one supplementary question which is, essentially, the PQ that I asked. Given what we know about COVID-19 today over the last one, two years of experience, may I ask if the Government would consider publishing the key quantitative and qualitative matrix and thresholds before decisions are made to change the safe management measures?",1,154,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00154
2022-01-10-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I do understand the need to be nimble. But, basically, having that decision-making framework and matrix published would actually help businesses and consumers to have greater confidence and clarity and, certainly, better than the situation where some people feel a certain sense of nervousness whenever the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) holds a press conference, especially those in F&B businesses which are most affected by the dine-in rules.",2,155,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00155
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member reiterated his question but I may have to reiterate my answer. As alluded to in the Member's supplementary question as well, we also do not want to be too rigid in setting the parameters or trigger points, for example, if we cross this, therefore, it will shut down from five to two and so on and so forth.",1,156,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00156
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think there are so many twists and turns in this pandemic, we would rather be a bit more nimble and to be able to adapt.",2,157,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00157
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But we take the Member's point and we have always adopted this position that we do not go for ""Freedom Day"", neither do we go for zero COVID-19. We want to strike a balance, preserve the healthcare capacity; at the same time, allow people to live life as normally as possible, businesses to be able to operate and survive. Each time we make a decision, we do explain why. We do show all the data – hospitalisation, ICU and so on and so forth – to give the full rationale, with numbers, why we decide that way. So, I also hope that, over time, people will begin to understand what our key considerations are, even though we may not be able to pinpoint trigger points.",3,158,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00158
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I should say that, ultimately, it is not about the numbers that cause all this uncertainty. It is a fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and our society, for two years, we were not entirely ready in the first year in terms of our resilience. Last year, we were much better and I do believe that, in 2022, we will be even better and that is most important. Remember, in 2020, when we faced a wave – it was hardly a wave, it was just clusters – we went into circuit breaker. Last year, in 2021, when we faced a wave, we went into what we called ""Phase Two (Heightened Alert)"". Group size was down to two. Restaurants did not close towards the end of the year but they operated with dine-in group size of two. Hopefully, this year, we can ride through waves with a much more liberal posture and that is how we keep on improving. And that is most important to our businesses.",4,159,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00159

2022-01-10-T-004,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two questions for the Minister for Health and this is with regard to averting a testing crunch that we see around the world amidst an Omicron-driven wave.",1,161,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00161
2022-01-10-T-004,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"My first question is, in the event of such a wave, how do we plan to avoid a run on testing facilities in our healthcare system for people who are keen to get a test – either PCR or ART – and this includes, of course, primary care providers that the Minister has mentioned in his answer, but also, importantly, emergency departments? How do we avoid a run on healthcare facilities for people who are keen to get a test ordered?",2,162,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00162
2022-01-10-T-004,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),The second question is about self-testing. How do we plan to ensure an adequate supply of ART kits to keep prices of these kits steady?,3,163,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00163
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the second question first, to keep prices steady and affordable, I think competition helps, choices help. So, we are constantly on the lookout for kits that are effective as well as lower priced. In that way, we bring them in and, recently, we have done so – FlowFlex, for example, is below $5 – and we will continue to be on the lookout. There have been many kits out there that claim to be cheaper but are not as effective. So, HSA does not approve all of them just unquestioningly. And we will continue to do that.",1,164,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00164
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As to the Member's question on how to prevent a run on testing facilities, number one, is to try as much as possible to plan ahead, have supply agreements signed, stock up. This is what we have been doing. And we will continue to monitor the situation, bearing in mind that we have seen in other countries where there has been a run.",2,165,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00165
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, a run happens when people panic. So, to prevent a run, do not make people panic. Omicron can be scary, it can go up a few times, it can be 10,000 cases, 15,000 cases a day. That is why we are telling the people now that it can reach that level. That is why we started what we called ""Protocols 1, 2, 3"", specifically Protocol 2, which sensitises people to self-test, self-report and self-discipline. And we have extended this now to GPs to also trigger Protocol 2. That way, I think people are sensitised to ""when I need a test, what do I do after a test?"" And when people know what they need to do, they do not panic, there is much less chance of a run on any testing facility.",3,166,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00166

I would like to ask the Minister for Education to confirm again, although I think he might have said so just now, that the VDS measures will not be applied to children below 12 years old for as long as it is and maybe at least until the non-mRNA vaccines are available for the kids. Because there is a strong request from the parents that, at least, there should be more choices for vaccines and the VDS measures will not be applied to the children. I also received feedback from residents that some teachers have already practised VDS measures in schools. So, can the Minister confirm whether the teachers are practising that or if any officers in the schools are practising that, that it is against the Government's policy at the moment?",1,168,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00168

2022-01-10-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may just repeat my answer in case Mr Leong Mun Wai was not around when I answered this just now. My specific answer was that, at this point in time, we have no plans on applying any VDS in our schools and that is because of the reasons that I have mentioned. We want, as far as possible, for our students to be able to participate in the core curriculum, in the school activities. For certain selected activities that may be deemed of higher risk, we may consider applying specific measures for them.",2,172,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00172

One, for example, of students participating in the playing of wind instruments or the choir; and, two, students participating in sports activities that may require physical contact or close physical contact. I also caveated my explanation by saying that, of course, we will have to look at the overall national posture and how the virus will continue to evolve for us to adjust our policies accordingly.",3,173,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00173

2022-01-10-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"With home recovery now as the default response to any positive COVID-19 test, does Minister agree that the risk of unreported cases is, actually, quite high?

2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I take the Member's point. In every country, they also have a concept of what they call ""ascertainment rate"", which is, of the underlying cases, how many are uncovered and reported. And every country knows that it cannot be 80%, 90% or 100%. Especially when you have a Delta wave or Omicron wave that is highly transmissible, you do want people to take self-responsibility, take care of themselves, isolate themselves and, in these cases, they may not be reported. So, they do happen in every country.",1,177,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00177
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To think about it, when we face an endemic disease, whether it is chicken pox or influenza, we cannot report every case and that is what endemicity means, which is, many people get it, many people are able to recover without it being officially reported. That is part and parcel of endemicity.",2,178,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00178
2022-01-10-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But notwithstanding that, testing remains important for us, first, to exercise self-responsibility; second, to have a sense of what is the prevalence of the virus in the community. And we continue to do quite a fair number of tests  over 20,000 PCR tests a day; over 150,000 ART tests a day. Some self-monitored, not reported, but many are. That will always give us a consistent measure of the prevalence of the virus in the community. And we will continue to do so in a practical way.",3,179,2022-01-10-T-004-S-00179

2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In September last year, with a substantial proportion of the Singapore population vaccinated, we launched the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). Two months later, on 26 November, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated Omicron as a ""Variant of Concern"". Then, scientists around the world were still trying to ascertain Omicron's transmissibility and virulence relative to Delta and the efficacy of existing vaccines against this new variant. As a precautionary move, based on reports of the spread of Omicron in Sub-saharan Africa, we restricted the entry and transit of non-residents from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe from 28 November; and from Ghana, Malawi and Nigeria from 5 December. Residents returning from these countries were subjected to a 10-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated facilities. We halted the expansion of the VTL scheme and deferred the launch of the already-announced VTLs to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. We also decided to maintain the daily quota for VTL (Air) travellers at 10,000, rather than increase it to 15,000, as we had earlier intended.",4,193,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00193
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On 22 December, given the rapid and global spread of the Omicron variant, we froze the sale of new VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore from 23 December 2021 to 20 January 2022. We also imposed a 50% limit on the daily number of VTL travellers from 21 January this year.",5,194,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00194
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan has asked whether this freeze was necessary, given our approach of living with COVID-19. As I have outlined, the freeze was part of a series of calibrated moves informed by the latest public health risk assessment as well as developments around the world. It was essential to balance the need to manage the risk of imported Omicron cases while minimising disruption to travellers who had already made VTL bookings to enter Singapore.",6,195,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00195
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Foo Mee Har had asked earlier about the breakdown of imported cases for Omicron. In summary, about 2,600 cases were imported. The key sources were the United States at 16%, United Kingdom at 16% and India at 11%. This broadly corresponds to the VTL traveller volume and, as most Members will appreciate, it is also influenced by the incidence of Omicron in these countries. I would add that, of the composition of this figure, less than 10% were actually short-term visitors. So, the bulk is actually Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and long-term visit pass (LTVP) holders who are returning to Singapore from overseas.",7,196,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00196
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Poh Li San, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about the additional enhanced measures for VTL travellers. In the first week of December 2021, in consultation with MOH, we introduced additional supervised self-administered antigen rapid tests (ARTs) for VTL travellers on Day Three and Day Seven after arrival. This is on top of the pre-departure and on-arrival test requirements. VTL travellers were also required to undergo self-administered ARTs on Days Two, Four, Five and Six of their arrival before going about their daily activities. Those who test positive are required to undergo a confirmatory PCR test. So, basically, pre-departure, on arrival and then from Day Two to Day Seven, there is daily ART self-administered, but on Days Three and Seven, they have to do it under supervision. And these have to be reported and, if there is a positive ART result, then they go for a PCR test.",8,197,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00197
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Collectively, these adjustments to our border and other measures have allowed us time to study and better understand the Omicron variant, to strengthen our defences, including our healthcare capacity, and to get more people vaccinated and boosted, as we have heard. We will continue to work closely with MOH to regularly review our border measures. As part of learning to live with the virus and its variants, we must press on with our efforts to restore our connectivity with the world while safeguarding public health. Our goal is to restore quarantine-free travel with more countries and regions, as allowed for by the public health assessment.",9,198,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00198
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the additional measures to protect airport workers from Omicron. Since 2 December 2021, we have enhanced the personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing protocols. All frontline airport workers are now placed on a seven-day PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) regime. For higher-risk frontline airport workers, an employer-supervised ART was introduced on the third day in addition to their seven-day PCR RRT. Further, all Singapore aircrew arriving from affected regions are required to undergo an on-arrival PCR test and post-arrival PCR tests on Days Three and Seven. These protocols will be adjusted, as they have in the past, in accordance with the latest public health risk assessments.",10,199,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00199
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Dr Tan Wu Meng asked about airflow and COVID-19 transmissibility at the airport. Since the onset of the pandemic, Changi Airport Group (CAG) has progressively upgraded the air ventilation system at the airport. For instance, CAG has upgraded the filters in the air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) system to Merv-14 filters, which are able to remove about 85% of particles of 0.3 to 1.0 micron in size. In other words, they can filter out particles smaller than the size of a respiratory particle containing the COVID-19 virus. With the emergence of the more transmissible Delta variant in May last year, CAAS, CAG, MOH, NEA and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) conducted an airflow study to identify spaces at the airport where ventilation and filtration could be further stepped up. Since then, 350 High Efficiency Particulate Absorbing (HEPA) portable air purifiers have been installed throughout the airport terminals at locations, such as staff canteens, rest areas and health screening stations. These HEPA air purifiers are also used in hospitals and they help to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19. Since September last year, CAG has also installed ultraviolet-C (UV-C) sanitation equipment in the airport terminal air-conditioning systems to provide an additional layer of defence.",11,200,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00200
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Dennis Tan, Mr Leon Perera, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Shawn Huang asked about upcoming VTL moves and the outlook for our air and maritime hubs in 2022.",12,201,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00201
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Our maritime hub has weathered the COVID-19 crisis relatively well, with container throughput at our port likely to reach an all-time high in 2021. Maritime businesses also continued to establish and expand operations here. We expect the favourable outlook for trade and shipping to continue in 2022. According to industry projections, global seaborne trade is expected to grow 3.5% in 2022, slightly below the estimate of 3.6% last year. We are working with our tripartite partners to seize these opportunities, continue growing our maritime sector and create more good jobs for Singaporeans.",13,202,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00202
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the other hand, air travel is expected to take several years to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Notwithstanding this, we remain confident of the long-term potential of air travel and are resolutely committed to working with Changi Airport Group and airline partners to rebuild and reclaim Singapore's status as an international air hub. Compared to 3% at the start of 2021, passenger traffic at Changi increased to about 15% of pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of December 2021, largely aided by our VTL schemes. A study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Oxford Economics has projected international passenger volume at the end of 2022 to recover to about 55% of 2019 levels, which is up from about 20% at the end of last year. Therefore, barring unexpected setbacks like Omicron, we anticipate further recovery in 2022.",14,203,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00203
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To Mr Leon Perera’s question, we do not restrict any airline from applying to operate VTL flights; the overall quota of inbound VTL travellers is allocated to airlines based on the plans they submit to CAAS. Low-cost carriers, such as Scoot, AirAsia and Jetstar Asia, already operate VTL flights from Malaysia. Scoot also operates VTL flights from Thailand and the Republic of Korea, Australia and Germany. Mr Perera also asked if we would allow more VTL flights during festive periods. You have heard from the MTF and also in today's session in Parliament, we closely monitor the demand for VTL flights and will regularly review the VTL quotas, always taking into consideration the prevailing public health assessment.",15,204,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00204
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Shawn Huang asked about our plans for the Singapore Airshow in 2022. The Singapore Airshow is one of the world’s leading airshows that bring together aerospace and defence leaders and key decision makers to conduct business and forge partnerships. The event organiser, Experia Events Pte Ltd, has announced that Singapore Airshow 2022 will go ahead from 15 to 18 February, for trade visitors only. To ensure the success of Singapore Airshow 2022, our Government agencies are working closely with the organiser on the public health protocols to facilitate its safe and smooth execution, including ensuring the safe entry of international trade attendees and safe management measures at the event.",16,205,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00205
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As part of living with COVID-19, we must shift to a new setting that will enable us to stay connected to the world. It is essential that we press on with our mission to reopen our borders. The VTL scheme is a useful pathfinder for us to establish, test and build confidence in safe reopening to vaccinated travellers. Ultimately, we want to work towards quarantine-free travel for all vaccinated travellers.",17,206,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00206
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Singapore’s global connectivity is critical to our economic competitiveness and the livelihoods of our people. It underpins our status as an international business centre and global trading hub. Over the past two years, the Government has provided significant support to preserve core capabilities in this strategic sector and to help them tide over this crisis. We will continue to work closely with our aviation stakeholders to rebuild a safe and sustainable Changi aviation hub.",18,207,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00207

2022-01-10-T-005,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive answers. I have two supplementary questions.",1,209,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00209
2022-01-10-T-005,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, in relation to a Nikkei article on 4 December, I quote Indonesia's Deputy Minister of State-owned Enterprises, Mr Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, mentioning in parliament about Kualanamu Airport, which they are actually looking to operate in Indonesia's North Sumatra region. He said, ""Kualanamu can be a base to reduce dominance of Changi and KLIA"" and that GMR Airports group has committed 56 trillion rupiahs or $3.8 billion to support the expansion. My first supplementary question (SQ) is in relation to that. And the Minister mentioned and elaborated on the aviation hub outlook. Can the Minister share what are the risks of our regional partners trying to gain a foothold in our aviation sector in terms of its growth and hub status as well? That is the first question.",2,210,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00210
2022-01-10-T-005,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, I am heartened to hear that CAAS is working to improve the airport ventilation rates, especially in a built environment. But the airport phase is key and I hope we can continue to enhance the airport phase's cleanliness, filters and airflows. My question is in relation to transport passenger volume. If we are going to grow it further forward, what measures can we take to enhance it even more because, definitely, with Changi Airport, we want to enhance the transit passenger volume even further as well.",3,211,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00211
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. First, on the reports that he has cited, I do not think I can speak with authority on the specific plans that the Indonesian government or, for that matter, any other government or regional players have. But let me start by saying that Changi is no stranger to competition. We have always had to compete with a whole variety of regional hubs. And there will continue to be new hubs that will emerge. Therefore, it is critical that we work at the system level with all the partners – whether it is Changi Airport Group, airline partners, SATS and other ground handlers, the unions and, certainly, the Government agencies, including CAAS. It is important that we mount a systemic response to preserve our competitiveness as an international aviation hub.",1,212,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00212
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Central to that, in terms of looking ahead, I think that it will be underpinned by two key factors. The first is to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic in a manner that is safe and robust so that travellers, airlines and, indeed, the general population, have the confidence that air travel can, in fact, continue in a safe manner and that Changi is one of the places that they can travel through with utmost confidence. That is key.",2,213,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00213
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"That is what we are working towards. So, throughout the last 12 to 18 months, for all the airport players here in the aviation cluster, basically, it has been a Herculean effort because we have had to invert the operating model in Changi. A civilian airport, in general, is designed for an experience, for passengers to interact and we have had to reverse that logic and start to look at segmentation, testing and all kinds of other necessary protocols to protect health, but it means the travel experience is diminished.",3,214,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00214
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But we are committed, as I have said earlier, to reclaiming and rebuilding our status as an international aviation hub. And our VTLs have helped us to raise volumes to about 15% or so of pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of last year and, based on both global projections and our own anticipation, we should be able to do better this year. But how much and how fast are really a function of the environment. And we need to always prioritise the public health assessment.",4,215,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00215
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would add that, beyond safe recovery, the longer-term competitive proposition of Changi will also rest on sustainability. And that is something that CAAS is working on with all the partners. That will also be an important competitive differentiator for us going forward.",5,216,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00216
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member's second point was on passenger volumes and, if we want to increase passenger volumes, what would it entail. I think it is fair to say that the current protocols, whilst necessary, do impose a limit on how much we can grow within the current set of formulations. So, we will have to work with our health authorities and the aviation partners to ascertain how much flexibility we have, going forward, and what are the possible rate-limiting steps or aspects that we need to reconfigure so that we can go for the next bound of growth in terms of passenger volumes in Changi. And that is an effort that is currently being undertaken by MOT with CAAS and all our partners.",6,217,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00217

2022-01-10-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),I thank the Minister for his answer. I would like to draw reference to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) I filed early in July 2021 about detection of COVID-19 in the built environment because better sensing of virus in the air and on surfaces may help us to find new vulnerabilities ahead of new clusters. I have an SQ for the Minister for Transport.,1,219,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00219
2022-01-10-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"The Minister has spoken about what has been done to clean the air filtration better, to try and sterilise surfaces better with UVC. But can I ask the Minister how are we evaluating the effectiveness of these measures? Are we checking whether there is viral detectability in the ambient air? Are we checking for detectable virus on surfaces that members of the public or members of staff may come into contact with?",2,220,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00220
2022-01-10-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"And if I may put a second SQ to MOT, can the Minister confirm that there is ongoing attention to making sure that existing security protocols in the airport also interlink safely with safe management measures? So, for example, where staff are required to have their faces validated against photo IDs, that this is done in a way that does not undermine the safe management processes against COVID-19.",3,221,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00221
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, if I may take the second question first and thanking the Member for raising these matters. Our highest priority is protecting the health and welfare of our frontline airport workers because, without them, the airport will not be able to function. So, we have undertaken a whole series of steps to ensure that our workers are protected to the best of our ability. And that is why I mentioned, specifically, the moves we have made with respect to personal protective equipment, or PPEs, and we have heightened them. In almost all the settings, they now wear N95 masks, for example, apart from the usual garb.",1,222,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00222
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would add that we have also the testing protocols that we have enhanced. All of these, on the one hand, ensure a higher level of safety for our workers. But I must also emphasise that it also means additional inconveniences and challenges. So, it is a constant recalibration, taking into account the risks, whilst we also focus on the welfare of the workers. So, the short answer to the Member's question is, of course, SMMs are our top priority and, when it comes to aspects like facial IDs and so on, all the necessary protocols are put in place and, if there is evidence that we need to do more, we will do more. But I just wanted to highlight to Members – and I have been engaged in conversations with the union leaders and so on – that every one of these moves does impose a real human burden, which we have to take into account.",2,223,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00223
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the first point on detection and how we continue to monitor, CAAS and Changi Airport are not the specialists in this area. But they are fully committed to protecting the environment to the best of their ability. In some ways, I think Changi Airport or its surrounding facilities are not too different from many commercial building settings and so on. This flow of people is from different sources and there are all kinds of activities and convergences.",3,224,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00224
2022-01-10-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, we will be informed by the general settings and requirements and make sure that these are observed rigorously. Second, we are also working with, as I have said, MOH, NEA and BCA. These are specialised agencies that have important perspectives that then informs the measures that we can take in Changi Airport, as necessary. So, let me assure Members that it is something that we are watching and monitoring closely and we will continue to take all necessary steps to protect the health and safety of our workers.",4,225,2022-01-10-T-005-S-00225

Among the 10% who responded, only a minority reported significant concerns about academic freedom in Singapore. I would, therefore, advise some caution in generalising the findings from the survey as representative of how all academics in Singapore feel. Academics in AUs have been able to teach, engage in discourse, research and publish on a wide range of topics, including domestic politics, race, religion and gender issues. It would be unfair to our academics to assume that they self-censor or feel inhibited.",2,231,2022-01-10-T-007-S-00231

These are, for marriage, that marriage is the cornerstone of family formation and, thus, the significance of the solemnisation and registration of marriages must be emphasised; the institution of marriage must be protected by ensuring that all marriages contracted here are genuine. And, for divorce, our first priority is to save marriages, but where divorce is inevitable, we must foster therapeutic justice to bring about healing so that the family can move on.

We have engaged citizens and stakeholders extensively on the divorce process, especially on the proposed divorce by mutual agreement of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage. We started this since 2020, when we convened a Citizen Panel involving more than 150 divorcees over a four-month period, many of whom bravely shared their marriage and divorce experiences with us, so that we can understand what they went through and make the necessary changes in our law and policies.

A statutory declaration must be made in person before a Commissioner for Oaths.

The RERF's aspiration was the adoption of therapeutic justice in the family justice system. In the context of family justice and couples undergoing divorce, therapeutic justice is a ""lens of care"" that seeks to help distressed families move forward in a more positive way.

Unlike in other jurisdictions, DMA will require parties to state the reasons that have led them to conclude that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. In doing so, parties would have to jointly take responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage. One party also cannot, unilaterally, divorce the other.

2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In this debate, I wish to make a few comments on the provisions relating to divorce, in particular, the introduction of a provision allowing divorce by mutual agreement or DMA.",2,345,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00345
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Clause 29 of the Bill introduces a new fact that can be relied upon to file for a divorce  that the marriage has broken down due to the spouses' agreeing that there has been an irretrievable breakdown. The new section 95A will add this new fact to the existing facts for divorce which centre around adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion and separation. In order to rely on this new fact, the spouses must enter into an agreement in writing, stating their reasons for concluding that the marriage has broken down, what efforts they have made to reconcile and what considerations they have given to the arrangements concerning their financial affairs and any child of the marriage.",3,346,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00346
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, in principle, I am supportive of the inclusion of DMA. This will empower the parties to a marriage to decide for themselves whether their marriage has failed, as they are probably the best-placed parties to assess whether they can continue to maintain the marriage.",4,347,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00347
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Currently, the potentially acrimonious nature of divorce proceedings can be traumatic. To illustrate, in my past professional work, I have seen how the children of the marriage can be pressured by one parent to give evidence against the other parent in a bid to prove that the other parent was an unreasonable or irresponsible person. The scars on the family from divorce are undeniable. If the amendment in this Bill can reduce the acrimony and emotional toll on the divorcing family, I support that rationale fully.",5,348,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00348
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier, the Minister of State explained in some detail how the DMA provisions will work. Nevertheless, I wish to seek two clarifications about this change.",6,349,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00349
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, to what extent can the parties override the traditional grounds for divorce? The new fact of mutual agreement broadens the possibility of divorce beyond the conventional grounds. For the conventional grounds, the law imposes time requirements which need to be satisfied. For instance, for adultery and unreasonable behaviour, the Women's Charter has always required that the offended spouse must not have continued to live with the offending spouse for more than six months after the last incident. This is to show that the offended spouse finds it unreasonable to continue living with such behaviour from the offending spouse. As for the fact of desertion, the offending spouse must have abandoned the other party for a continuous period of two years or more. As for using separation as a fact of divorce, the period required is that either of the spouses have lived apart for at least four years, or for at least three years where the other spouse consents to the divorce.",7,350,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00350
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"With the introduction of DMA, it seems to me that parties can agree to divorce where the situations could have come under the traditional grounds but the usual timeframes have not been met. For instance, if the spouses have been living apart, they can agree to divorce if they have been separated for much shorter periods than three years; say, for just six months. To this end, I wonder if retaining the provision for divorce on three years' separation with consent makes sense, as it may be redundant to insist on three years once the parties have agreed to divorce.",8,351,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00351
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Since the purpose of allowing mutual agreement is to do away with onerous requirements of the traditional grounds, the parties can override what was required previously and set their own personal threshold for concluding that their marriage has failed. Some will have lower thresholds.",9,352,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00352
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Is there a risk then that divorce would become too easy? On this question, I do note that there is no change to the requirement that one cannot, generally, file for divorce until after three years of marriage. I agree that this requirement should be preserved. Nevertheless, with the introduction of DMA, the requirements for divorce have arguably been relaxed. Should we then expect an increase in divorce rates?",10,353,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00353
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My second clarification on DMA is how the rights of the spouses and children will be safeguarded. The proposed section 95(6) provides that the spouses must enter any agreement with certain requirements which include spelling out what considerations they have given to sorting out their financial affairs and any child of the marriage. I am concerned about the risk that the parties may enter into an agreement which is unfair to one spouse or not in the best interest of the children. This could well happen when the spouses have unequal bargaining power or when one spouse has legal representation and the other does not. In this regard, I do acknowledge the point made by the Minister of State earlier that this can also happen in other types of divorce, not just DMA.",11,354,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00354
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"But specifically, regarding DMA, I have this clarification  if the Court comes across an agreement that is clearly one-sided or detrimental to the children, am I right to assume that the Court may still endorse DMA, but rewrite the arrangements regarding finances and children? In my view, it is critical for the Court to play a watchdog role for any vulnerable parties.",12,355,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00355
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, before I end, I would like to speak briefly on the issue of enforcement of Court Orders for maintenance payments. As Members of Parliament, we do come across single parents who are frustrated and demoralised by having to file repeated applications to Court to get ex-spouses to pay up. These efforts incur legal costs and may require multiple Court attendances without any tangible outcome. I also understand that when there are arrears in maintenance payments, it is not uncommon that the defaulting parent will be allowed to pay the arrears in instalments, placing further hardship on the other parent to find ways to pay bills and feed the children. If the defaulting parent defaults again, the onus is on the innocent parent once again to take out further enforcement proceedings.",13,356,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00356
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Although not covered in this Bill, I note that there are plans by the Government to provide a more efficient and effective means to enforce maintenance orders and to minimise the need for repeat enforcement. It was stated in the Ministry's press release of 1 November on this Bill that the Government is looking into making enhancements to the enforcement of maintenance orders under another law, the Family Justice Act, which will be tabled some time this year. And earlier, the Minister of State confirmed this as well.",14,357,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00357
2022-01-10-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),This is a welcome announcement. It is absolutely necessary to reduce the burden on the parent who is simply seeking to obtain for themselves and their children what is due from an ex-spouse.,15,358,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00358

2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),I fully support this on the basis that this might be less damaging to the emotional well-being of any children involved and goes some way towards protecting the children.,2,362,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00362
2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Currently, when it comes to the paying of maintenance post-divorce, the onus is usually on the man to maintain his ex-wife and children. However, times have changed. Over the years, the issue of gender-neutral maintenance has been raised in this House many times.",3,363,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00363
2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"There are more men who choose to stay at home to look after the children and the household these days. According to MOM's Labour Force in Singapore Report, there were about 1,500 stay-at-home fathers in 2017, an increase of 700 from a decade earlier. An in-depth study of some of these fathers found that most of them made the choice because their wives were earning more than them.",4,364,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00364
2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Indeed, in a double-income household, women may be earning more than their husbands. What happens in the case of a divorce? While men were previously not allowed to seek maintenance, amendments were earlier made to the Women's Charter in 2016 to allow ill, disabled or ex-husbands to seek maintenance from their ex-wives if they are incapacitated, unable to support themselves.",5,365,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00365
2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"But it is now 2022 and perhaps we can make further progress in moving towards gender-neutral arrangements for maintenance. In many countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada and many European countries, men can claim maintenance from their wives. In Britain, spousal maintenance is paid by the man or woman with the higher income to the one with the lower income.",6,366,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00366
2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"In 2014, The Straits Times reported an instance of a man who was ordered to pay $70,000 in maintenance to his former wife despite the fact that he was retired, she earned more than him and he paid the mortgage of their marital home. It may be timely for us to re-examine if we should further level the playing field to ensure that our maintenance laws reflect the changes in society and are fair to both parties.

2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"We also understand that the Family Justice Courts has been simplifying divorce proceedings since 2015 to allow couples who want to divorce to do so after they have reached an agreement on the divorce, together with all the ancillary matters. Currently, about 60% of the divorce cases have been filed through the simplified procedures.",9,369,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00369
2022-01-10-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Many people feel that once the Bill is passed, most of the divorcing couples will file for divorce on grounds of DMA.

Like many Members of this House, I was brought up to believe that marriage is a beautiful thing – something to be protected. But like the Members who have spoken before me and most family law practitioners and women's groups, I support the proposal that providing a less adversarial, more amicable path for divorce and settlement of disputes, without the need to blame either party for adultery, desertion or unreasonable behaviour, will help to reduce conflict during a most difficult time, especially for those with less resources to lawyer up. This will help parties to move on with their lives and the lives of any children involved.",1,377,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00377

2022-01-10-T-011,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Having said that, there are two aspects of the Bill that are crucial to providing important safeguards in light of the proposed amendments.",3,379,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00379
2022-01-10-T-011,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"First, as described in Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill, the provisions related to pre-agreement on matters related to parenting and finances, counselling, mediation, programmes for children, family support programmes and reconciliation. These are all very important safeguards against the criticism that the Bill makes divorce too easy. More importantly, it is in the best interests of the family. In the US, studies have shown that in about 10% of divorces, both parties are often open to efforts to reconcile and, recently, in the UK, the same percentage, 10% of divorce proceedings started, are averted with counselling. Indeed, stronger processes for counselling and mediation pre-marriage as well as before and after a divorce must also go hand in hand with the current proposals in this Bill.",4,380,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00380
2022-01-10-T-011,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Second, as described in Part 5, are the broader enforcement powers granted to the Court over custody and child access orders. Of all the foundations upon which we build our lives, family is the most important and we are moved to recognise that kids need their moms and their dads to raise them. Society needs their moms and dads to raise them.",5,381,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00381

2022-01-10-T-011,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Two, should there not be a minimum time period for the proceedings to allow proper reflection, consideration and reconciliation? This should not prevent applications for interim support, injunctions or family violence orders, and voluntary counselling and mediation should continue as planned. Further, has the Minister considered making it a requirement for divorcing couples to take a parenting education course – perhaps this is the MPP referred to by the Minister of State – but including information on reconciliation or to take it even further, making counselling and mediation mandatory?",10,386,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00386
2022-01-10-T-011,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Three, regardless of the grounds for divorce, should there be a minimum period – say, six months to a year – after the final judgment and orders, during which counsellors and mediators check in on the parties to ensure both parents and children are coping well and that the orders are being adhered to?",11,387,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00387
2022-01-10-T-011,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Four, there is, in some quarters, a perception that the system is biased against men and there is a limited range of support services for men. At this point, I want to recognise the millennial men, who, I think, take on a much more equal role in parenting than their predecessors and are often very close to their children. When things do not work out between the couple, they want to keep that bond. I believe that, for the most part, all services are equally available to men and women.

2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In principle, I agree with the provisions of section 126A of the Bill. However, I would caution that before making any order to the bailiff to seize a child, the Court should consider taking action against the parent who is in breach of the custody order.

2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"First, the new section 126B(3)(e) provides power to the Court to sentence a defaulting parent to a fine or imprisonment term. In my view, where a parent in default is recalcitrant, the Court’s power to impose a fine or sentence to incarceration will serve as a strong deterrent not to disobey a Court order. However, Sir, I am mindful that there may be occasions when an older child may refuse to see the other parent due to previous negative experiences of being physically or emotionally abused. Or that child may witness his Parent Y being abused by Parent X. Hence, if the child grew up filled with anger against that abusive parent, he may resist any order for access granted to the parent who was abusive.",12,405,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00405
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In situations like this, I hope that a judge hearing such enforcement applications will exercise discretion to interview the child or appoint a counsellor for the child to hear the child’s point of view before making any order of fine or imprisonment. I hope that the Court will be able to discern the circumstances where an access order may not be practical due to an abusive parent. We should not allow an abusive or vindictive parent to abuse the legal process and commit the other parent to jail.",13,406,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00406
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Second, on clause 35, may I ask the Minister of State whether we have enough counsellors to help divorcing parents deal with the issue of access? Counselling can be a long-drawn process and, with about 7,000 divorces every year, these counsellors will be stretched if there are not enough trained counsellors to share the workload. When the Family Courts introduced the compulsory Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP), I thought that MPP would have counsellors who can help couples think through the process before applying for divorce. However, I was told that MPP is a short session to advise the applicant on the need to make provisions for the child of the marriage.",14,407,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00407
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I am certainly glad to hear the Minister of State say that MPP would be enhanced to provide more support to couples thinking of divorce. Sir, I urge the Ministry to provide more resources to counsellors so that we can do more to assist couples who are contemplating divorce to review their options and also assess the potential impact on the child before proceeding.",15,408,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00408
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, next, I wish to express my concern about clause 29 of the Bill which introduces a new section 95A(1)(f). This new section provides a new ground for parties to apply for a divorce if Parties X and Y agree that the marriage has broken down irretrievably – what is described by MSF as divorce by mutual agreement, or DMA. In 2016, the then Minister for Social and Family Development summed up the Government's policy as follows  “Singapore is our home for family. Strong families are, and must remain, the basic building blocks of our society. In the coming years, my Ministry will continue to strengthen fundamental family relationships and support vulnerable families.”",16,409,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00409

My understanding of a family in Singapore is that it constitutes a married couple with children and they form the usual family structure in Singapore. Thus, if the Government's policy is to have strong families which are the building blocks of society, then I submit that the Government must do more to promote the institution of marriage so as to strengthen the parties’ commitment to marriage.",17,410,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00410

2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"My concern is whether the new section 95A(1)(f) will make it easier for couples who cannot work out their disputes to take the easy way out and apply for divorce based on mutual agreement. In a written response by the National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) in June last year, NCCS expressed concern that “some couples may see the amicable divorce option as providing an easy exit that will allow them to run away from their problems without having to assign blame. Thus, instead of trying to find solutions to their problems as a couple that have pledged their lifelong commitment to each other, that husband or wife may simply decide to end their marriage.” Sir, I share the same concern as NCCS.",20,413,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00413

Currently, there are five possible grounds which constitute irretrievable breakdown of marriage. Three of these grounds are what divorce lawyers commonly call “fault” divorces  adultery, unreasonable behaviour and desertion for a period of two years. These are factors causing the irretrievable breakdown in marriage  a party's adultery, a party's unreasonable behaviour or a party's desertion. The other two grounds are what we call “no fault” divorces which are based on separation for a period of three years with consent or separation for four years even without consent. It is the period of living separate and apart which causes the marriage to breakdown.",22,415,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00415
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Some Members of this House may recall that in the 1970s, parties applying for divorce based on separation were required to live separate and apart for an even longer period of seven years. So, over these years, there have been changes to make divorce easier by shortening the separation period. Thus, in actual fact, parties can divorce without apportioning fault, except that they need to wait the statutory period of three years or four years.",23,416,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00416

Thus, for parties who wish to settle their divorce cases quickly, the Simplified Track divorce is already an option where parties have to be less acrimonious if they want their divorce to proceed smoothly. They still need to cite one of the five grounds when they file for the divorce. But most parties will come to a compromise on the grounds of divorce.

What is the change in circumstances that triggered the need for the introduction of this provision? Does the Government not acknowledge that a divorce may have serious consequences for the children? Some years back, MCCY, as it then was, used to produce pamphlets on divorce  ""Before you Divorce"", ""Divorce"" and ""How to Survive Children and Divorce"". And these pamphlets highlighted the real issues about divorce. One particular pamphlet stood out to me – this is it, for Members of the House who are interested – and this pamphlet says  “At some time in a marriage, problems will arise. Some of these problems seem intractable, others do not. For the problems that seem intractable, people often think that divorce is the answer."" And it concluded with the words ""Think Again"".",28,421,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00421

So, this pamphlet is available to parties who wanted to file for divorce at the time and it really urged couples thinking of divorce to ""Think Again"". May I ask the Minister of State whether she would agree that allowing a divorce based on mutual agreement may, inadvertently, undermine the marriage vow and parties’ commitment to the institution of marriage? A vow to commit to a marriage can now simply be revoked by mutual agreement to divorce.",29,422,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00422
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Has the Government made any study of the experience in other countries which allow divorce by mutual consent? NCCS cited a study that said that after the first “no-fault divorce” was adopted in California, there was a persistent decline in marriage rates, accompanied by more single parenthood and cohabitation. Would allowing DMA result in an increase in divorce rates? What if this amendment does, in actual fact, result in divorce applications going up by a large number in the next few years? Would there be more single parenthood? How would the Government then try to arrest the increase in divorce numbers because it may be impossible to turn back the change?",30,423,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00423
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the media release by MSF, the Government cited that there was strong feedback against having to cite fault against the other party and having to dredge up the past just to prove the facts. However, section 95A(6) still requires parties to state in writing the reasons leading X and Y to conclude that their marriage has irretrievably broken down and their efforts made to reconcile. When parties have to cite the reasons for concluding that the marriage has broken down irretrievably, it will be inevitable that there would be some accusations against the other. I also hope that the Government is cognisant that DMA does not mean that there will not be acrimonious litigation. Parties could still fight tooth and nail regarding custody, care and control over the children. They will still fight over the division of assets and maintenance.",31,424,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00424
2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sadly, Sir, divorce is a very emotional process where parties frequently feel betrayed and the acrimony is always there. Sometimes, where parties acknowledge that no one is at fault but they nevertheless want a divorce due to incompatibility or for whatever reason, the advice that can be given to them is to live separate and apart and meet the legal criteria for divorce based on three years or four years separation. Sometimes, parties may want a divorce due to misunderstandings, failure to communicate, quarrels over issues which they feel emotional about. In situations like these, separation may allow parties time to cool down, to review their reasons for wanting a divorce.",32,425,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00425

2022-01-10-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),The Government has to strike a balance between making it too difficult for parties in failed marriages to get a divorce versus making it too easy for couples to give up their commitment and call it quits when they encounter difficulties in their marriage. I seek the Government's assurance that we are not taking the latter approach. I would like to ask the Minister of State to assure Members of this House that the Government is committed to promoting and strengthening marriages between couples and that the Government has no intent to allow couples to give up on their marriage too easily.

The institution of marriage is one of the oldest practices that has been established since the birth of human civilisation, yet the notion of romantic love as the motivating force for marriage only goes as far back as the Middle Ages and the American and French revolutions. But for much of human history prior, couples were brought together for practical reasons and not because they fell in love. Even in the 20th century and within our very own Pioneer Generation, arranged marriages were not an uncommon theme amongst Singaporeans. Perhaps, on reflection, it seems that our understanding and experience of romantic marriages are of a much lesser degree and, consequently, our principles and laws governing such marriages, likewise, see a need for finetuning and revision.",1,438,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00438

As a society, we strive to nurture and preserve the sacred union of a couple. Yet, as we recognise that the dissolution of marriage has become more common in today's day and age, this Parliament, as leaders of society, must look to invest time and effort to understand not only the struggles of divorce, but also to provide the requisite support individuals need in the aftermath of such a decision.

The provision of livelihood options and its surrounding support mechanisms, such as caregiving support to divorced women and parents, are an important key to this fresh start.

An example of diluted significance of marriages for the purpose of convenience can be found in Nevada, United States. Las Vegas, in the city of Nevada, is known to have a booming wedding industry. Wedding-related tourism accounts for nearly US$2 billion of the city's annual US$58 billion tourism industry and generates about 18,000 jobs. One of the reasons for its booming industry is the convenience to get married, such as drive-through wedding services and 24-hour chapels to solemnise couples. Similarly, this has also impacted the divorce rate in Nevada, which has one of the highest divorce rates in the United States, with a rate of nearly 21 divorces per 1,000 married women in 2019.",6,461,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00461

In the amendment, the new section 95(3) stated that a Court ""must dismiss an application if it is not satisfied that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and there remains a reasonable possibility that the parties might reconcile"". There could, however, be situations where a spouse, who has higher financial control and power over the other, coerces the dependant spouse into mutual agreement to divorce but not out of that spouse's own will. In such situations, how will the Court be able to determine if the mutual agreement of the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage may not be out of their own volition of one of the parties?

In my interactions with residents who are going through divorces, they often share the emotional difficulties that they faced during the proceedings and worry about the impact that their divorce has on their children, especially when the other party refuses to cooperate and allow for a smooth divorce process. I have a resident who once sought my help and shared with me how her ex-husband was missing through most part of the divorce proceedings and was only contactable before the final judgment for divorce is delivered by the Court. In such cases where the marriage has become acrimonious and one of the parties refuses to attend MPP to proceed with the divorce proceedings, will the other half be stuck in the marriage and unable to move on? I would also like to ask what happens if the couple is going through a family violence situation and the perpetrator is not willing to attend MPP?

As far as possible, conditions need to be created to allow couples to reconcile amidst family disputes and marriage breakdowns. It is inevitable that divorces can occur and families possibly broken apart. It is my belief that there must then be therapeutic justice incorporated in divorce proceedings, in which acrimony and hostility during these proceedings would not be aggravated and the children's best interest is prioritised. Although couples can no longer be husbands and wives, they continue to be parents and role models for their children. Therefore, it is important that the amendments to the Women's Charter allow couples to have closure and move on with their separate lives, while continuing to be the pillar of support for the children that they would likely have to raise jointly.

If I may ask the Minister, in respect of make-up access orders, would this be determined with the best interest of the child in mind, before such orders are made? I ask this because there may be other limitations, such as the child's other commitments and her or his own rest periods.

In this regard, usually, such breaching parent is the one with the care and control of the child. Hence, would not a jail term be effectively disruptive to the care of the child? In such an instance, who would take care of the child and who would effectively have care and control then?

If both parents reach an agreement, it should be stated in the Matrimonial Property Plan and reflected in the divorce judgment. If they do not, each parent should present their reasons to the judge, who can make an order on which parent gets to list the child as an occupier. This is not overly intrusive, as judges already settle property matters during divorce proceedings, such as by dividing the matrimonial property.

2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second suggestion is about the ""Children-in-Between"" programme. It is an exceptionally good programme that provides counselling and support for children whose parents are undergoing divorce. I raised this previously and am again calling for the Ministry to consider making it mandatory for all children whose parents are undergoing a divorce. In the past few years, many people undergoing divorce have approached me for help and many are in tears as they share their painful journey. Often, I see their child, at times, a very young child, hugging their parents, comforting them and providing tissues to wipe their tears. The children step up but I often wonder if they truly understand what is happening to mummy and daddy and whether we are providing them with enough help during this very confusing, painful and distressing period for someone who is so young.",15,511,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00511
2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, my proposal is that the Court should, by default, order that all children of divorced parents participate in the ""Children-in-Between"" programme. Parents can appeal to opt out. Currently, and, unfortunately, less than 2% of children affected by divorce attend this programme. We should do a lot more to make this number as close to 100% as possible.",16,512,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00512
2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final suggestion is about renaming the Women's Charter. When the Women's Charter was enacted in 1961, it was instrumental in protecting the rights of women. Today's amendments ensure that the Charter continues to do so, including by clarifying the rights and duties of husbands and wives. As we modernise this law, we should also consider making its name more appropriate. My proposal is that we rename it to the Family Charter. This is for three reasons.",17,513,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00513
2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, the bulk of this law protects not just women but men and children as well. This is true of the existing law.

No-fault divorces, children support programmes and modernised marriage solemnisations are all good not just for women but also for families in general.",18,514,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00514
2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, bundling family- and children-specific laws under a Women's Charter has the unintentional effect of suggesting that women have some unique place in raising children. It runs against everything else this Government is saying, that men need to contribute equally at home, that employers should not treat women and mothers differently. I know the Government does not mean to send this message, but that is what it looks like. This is bad for women and it is bad for families.",19,515,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00515
2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, there is a rising, incorrect sentiment that the Women's Charter is bad for men. Research by AWARE and Quilt.AI found that one of the main narratives in online misogyny is that ""men are unprotected by the law."" The problem is summed up by one of the examples cited in the research  ""Where is the Men's Charter?"" Undoubtedly, we know these voices are wrong. But renaming the Women's Charter to accurately describe its scope can help defuse the anger.",20,516,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00516

We will continue to need changes in laws and mindsets to make progress on the road towards gender equality.",22,518,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00518
2022-01-10-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In summary, my points today are  one, that the Ministry should make flat applications easier for parents with shared care and control; two, the Ministry should mandate the Children-in-Between Programme for children with divorced parents; and three, that we rename the Women's Charter to the Family Charter.

Couples in Singapore must commit to marriage for at least three years before any sort of divorce is allowed, barring exceptional circumstances. For at least one party in a marriage to consider divorce, especially when there are children in the picture, it may signify that there were irreconcilable differences.

Will it involve professionals in family affairs, such as marriage counsellors, therapists, mediators as well as social workers who work with family and children?

Can the couple appeal if the Court rejects their request for a no-fault divorce?",6,526,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00526

If we can identify potential problems early, couples may be better prepared to deal with them and ameliorate any consequences. My suggestion is to normalise marriage counselling and make it more accessible to all. I am heartened that many religious leaders have expressed support to help strengthen marital ties and resolve marital disputes. MSF, likewise, provides free marital counselling.

I have a resident who wanted to get marital counselling. However, her husband was of the opinion that her concerns are too trivial and that seeing a counsellor was embarrassing and deemed as a waste of time. Unfortunately, marital problems may be analogous to cancer. If your signs are not detected and addressed early and when they snowball, the situation becomes implacable or terminal.

Under existing policies, there is a mandatory parenting programme for couples with children under 21 years old. In Sweden, a couple filing for divorce may obtain family advice to resolve cohabitation conflicts and, conceivably, avoid divorce.

They have children and hope to co-parent them but have some disagreements over shared custody as well as the allocation of assets and resources. They have no wish to take the matter to Court.

At the risk of sounding utilitarian – and my intention is not to undermine the sanctity of marriage but to take a pragmatic view – we must note that couples are getting married at older ages now, compared to 40 years ago. The average Singaporean man gets married three years later and the average Singaporean woman five years later. Much time is spent and wasted because the current Charter only allows couples to apply for divorce after three years of marriage. And this is precious time lost for those who find out after getting married and living together that they are not the right lifelong partners for each other.",13,567,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00567

I recognise that it is a difficult matter to choose and decide on, whether we should mandate time for the couples to work things out in order to ""save marriages"" or allow people to move on and to pursue the possibility of more workable marriages. Some data would be helpful and we should look into data on how successful the deed of separation has been in achieving reconciliation. What numbers of marriages get successfully salvaged and turned around after the deed of separation period? If the data shows that most of them end in divorce anyway, I recommend the time bar for divorce be reduced to one year for all couples.",16,570,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00570

2022-01-10-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I welcome this amendment which I feel will help reduce the agony and bitterness during the difficult process of divorce, since neither party will have to provide evidence of each other's faults. Hopefully, the couple can channel most of their energy and resources to moving forward or, in the case where there are children, making suitable new arrangements to care for them. I believe that this section may even be a lifesaver in preventing some couples' situations from escalating, which could, potentially, cause harm to themselves or their children. The process of separating and breaking up a family is so stressful and emotional. There had been cases in the past where one or both parties inflict physical harm on each other or their kids. This situation is to be avoided at all costs and the risk of confrontational exchanges must be minimised.",2,579,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00579

Unfortunately, there has been quite a number of foreigners who abuse the system and marry for convenience to stay or work, sometimes illegally, in Singapore. The Ministry must continue to review our measures to deter those who want to marry for convenience. The penalties must be suitably set at levels which will be effective deterrents.",3,580,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00580

2022-01-10-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, DMA is, essentially, a ""no-fault divorce"", which enables couples to take joint responsibility for the breakdown of their marriage. The rationale for introducing such a concept, as explained by MSF, arose from feedback from divorcees that having to cite one of the current fault-based facts as the reason for divorce dredges up unhappy memories and can cause the divorce proceedings to turn acrimonious, thus making it detrimental to the emotional well-being of their children. In essence, however, it can be argued that DMA makes the divorce process easier.",3,608,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00608

The divorce process should not be made too easy as we want couples to work through their problems that will, inevitably, crop up in any marriage. Major challenges, such as struggling to care for their first-born who refuses to stop crying in the middle of the night or coping with the financial squeeze that couples with young children and elderly parents to care for, are par for the course. These are everyday marital problems and we should provide couples with the tools to resolve communication issues, instead of making divorce a simple, straightforward, easy solution.",4,609,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00609

For example, MSF could make marriage preparation courses more extensive and, I would even argue, mandatory. Before I got married, my wife-to-be and I had to attend the Marriage Preparation Course conducted by the Church. The course, which comprised six sessions, taught us the fundamentals of a healthy marriage and equipped us with tools to work out our differences in a constructive way.",6,611,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00611

2022-01-10-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, another suggestion on how we can do more upstream to strengthen marriages is to have regular check-ups on the health of our marriages, particularly newer marriages. Many of us go for a regular health check-up, sometimes yearly, sometimes once every two years. Why not have a regular check-up for our marriages, too?",9,614,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00614

Why is this so? Is it linked to certain key life moments that changed the dynamics of the relationship? I hope that MSF could make marriage therapy more affordable and accessible, so that we can help couples take stock of their relationships and strengthen their marriages. Perhaps, we could go a step further and subsidise marriage therapy for couples who are between their fifth to 10th year of marriage, since it seems to be the critical period where marriages are vulnerable and divorce cases are at their highest.",10,615,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00615

And this could be done through mandatory pre-divorce counselling programmes. Currently, pre-divorce counselling is only mandatory for parents with minor children before they file for divorce and is designed to encourage divorcing couples to make informed decisions to prioritise the well-being of their children. Can MSF consider mandatory pre-divorce counselling for all couples who cite unreasonable behaviour as the reason for their divorce and, in future, the couples who cite DMA as a reason for the divorce?",11,616,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00616
2022-01-10-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, we should also better support single mothers who may need help in securing jobs or finding jobs that will allow them to support themselves and their children. In cases where the wife was a homemaker, it can be difficult for them to re-enter the workforce easily as their skillsets may not be updated. In this regard, NTUC has been working with our affiliated unions, the Employment and Employability Institute and NTUC Learning Hub, to support single mothers by bringing employment and training opportunities to them. I encourage all single mums who need help returning to the workplace to turn to the Labour Movement for support.",12,617,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00617

In Radin Mas, we partnered Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) to launch the Jobs Closer to Home Programme in 2021 to help mothers with caregiving responsibilities find jobs that are closer to home, so that they can balance work and their roles as a mother and caregiver.

How would the Ministry identify such cases and are there penalties that will arise as a result of such fake divorces?,16,621,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00621
2022-01-10-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"In conclusion, the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter are aimed at making divorce proceedings less acrimonious and help ex-couples co-parent better. But it has also made divorce easier, inadvertently eroding the sanctity of marriage. We should do more upstream to help strengthen marriages and prevent relationships from breaking down, through mandatory and extensive marriage preparation programmes and make marriage therapy, marriage counselling cheaper and more accessible. Sir, I support the Bill.",17,622,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00622

2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Speaker, I thank Members for the robust debate, the pertinent issues raised and their support for the Bill. Important issues have been raised by Members regarding the proposals and the very institutions of marriage and family in Singapore.",1,624,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00624
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Let me first reiterate our core beliefs regarding marriage and divorce, which our proposed amendments intend to strengthen. Marriage is the cornerstone of family formation in our society. We must protect the institution of marriage by ensuring the significance of the solemnisation and registration of marriages and that marriages contracted here are genuine.",2,625,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00625
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Divorce must be a last resort. Our first priority is to save marriages where possible. Where there is no alternative but divorce, our aim is to help families heal and move on. Reducing acrimony and promoting child-centricity in divorce are key.",3,626,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00626
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The Women's Charter is a significant Act, enacted in 1961. Ms Carrie Tan and Mr Louis Ng proposed renaming the Women's Charter to the Family Charter. We will not be doing so in today's amendments as, if we look at the provisions on marriage and divorce, the provisions are gender-neutral and do not discriminate in favour of men or women.",4,627,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00627
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The Women’s Charter sets out how family and family relationships should be managed. To quote Prof Leong Wai Kum, School of Law, SUSS, ""the Women's Charter promulgated the idea of marriage as an equal cooperative partnership of different efforts"". The Women's Charter also provides for protection of women and girls in the areas of vice, prostitution activities for which there is good reason for this distinction as women are disproportionately affected. And while Singapore women today are better educated with better employment opportunities, there are still vulnerable women who require the protection of the Women's Charter.",5,628,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00628
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Moving on to the issues regarding the marriage-related proposals, in reviewing the marriage processes under the Women's Charter, we sought to achieve two key things.",6,629,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00629
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Firstly, we sought to enhance the marriage process to provide greater convenience to couples. The amendments will enable us to take the marriage process online via the ""Our Marriage Journey"" portal later this year.",7,630,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00630
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh raised concerns of marriages of convenience and I assure Members that the Registry of Marriages will continue to perform due diligence. If there are concerns, the declaration would be performed in-person or via video-link, instead of online, and the Registrar may decide not to permit solemnisation via video-link.",8,631,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00631
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked how many marriages of convenience we have seen and how many have been involved in vice activities. Between 2014 and 2021, there have been 388 individuals convicted for engaging in or arranging such marriages. We do not track if they have engaged in vice activities.",9,632,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00632
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,Ms Joan Pereira asked if the digital certificates would apply to both civil and religious ceremonies and who would issue the digital certificates. Digital certificates would apply to all solemnisations and will be issued by the Registrar of Marriages.,10,633,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00633
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Ms Ng Ling Ling voiced concerns that digitalising the solemnisation may downplay its significance. We understand her concerns. Hence, couples may choose to hold their solemnisation in-person. Indeed, we have seen that most couples still prefer to hold their solemnisations in-person. In addition, while a digital marriage certificate will be issued, a hardcopy ceremonial marriage certificate will also be provided as a keepsake. Through the ""Our Marriage Journey"" portal, we will continue to emphasise the importance of the solemnisation.",11,634,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00634
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Second, we sought to update the necessary safeguards to ensure that the institution of marriage is not abused and continues to be protected. Beyond legislative amendments, upcoming initiatives also boost our efforts to strengthen marriages and families. We have brought together stakeholders, community partners and Singaporeans to co-create and implement solutions through the launch of the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships last year. We have also woven support for couples into the marriage process.",12,635,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00635
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Melvin Yong suggested more can be done to encourage couples to attend marriage preparation courses, including by making it mandatory. The ""Our Marriage Journey"" portal will recommend and encourage couples to sign up for such courses. However, it is only mandatory where one party is below the age of 21, as the dissolution rates for such marriages are relatively higher. Nonetheless, we strongly encourage all couples to attend marriage preparation programmes and we provide rebates of $140 for couples to attend the 12-hour PREP workshop, or $70 for supported programmes offered by the community.",13,636,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00636
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I also agree with Ms Joan Pereira that it is important that solemnisers are equipped with counselling skills. We have started a pilot initiative, Journey with You, referred to as JOY, in short, which enables licensed solemnisers to mentor newlyweds in the first year of marriage. They will undergo training and are provided referral resources.",14,637,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00637
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,Let me move on now to the issues raised on the divorce proposals. I am glad that there is consensus among Members on several areas.,15,638,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00638
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"First, as raised by many Members, divorce is and must be a last resort. Where possible, we aim to save the marriage and help couples resolve their issues.",16,639,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00639
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I agree with Mr Yip Hon Weng that couples should be encouraged to seek counselling early, before marital issues worsen. Where there is no other option apart from divorce, we aim to help couples to heal and we also ensure that the welfare of the children is protected.",17,640,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00640
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Melvin Yong brought up the worrying trend of more recent cohorts divorcing earlier. He asked why such a trend has emerged. We believe that this is due, in part, to higher expectations of marital satisfaction and greater stressors in the early years of marriage, especially as more couples are dual income and they juggle career and parenthood. This is a trend not just emerging in Singapore but it has been apparent in many parts of the world for some time.",18,641,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00641
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Therefore, as raised by Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, our commitment is to protect the marriage and save it where possible. But we must do more, beyond legislation. The legislative amendments must be seen in totality with non-legislative initiatives which will help couples resolve issues at all stages of their relationship. When stresses begin to emerge, we have marital and family counselling under the FAM@FSC to help families resolve issues early.",19,642,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00642
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Melvin Yong suggested that marriage therapy be made more accessible and affordable. Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked if there are sufficient trained professionals to cater to demand, what the average waiting time is for appointments and if there is remedial action if the couple do not attend subsequent counselling sessions. Ms Mariam Jaafar similarly asked about funding and resources for such services. I would like to say that by the end of this year, there will be 10 FAM@FSCs across the island that can support couples facing marital and familial stress and they will be well-equipped to manage the projected demand. In terms of waiting time, parties will be contacted by the agency within a week.",20,643,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00643
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"As these counselling sessions are voluntary, there is no remedial action that can be taken by the Ministry or FAM@FSC should the couple not choose to continue. Nonetheless, if counselling is ordered by the Court, then, in the case of non-compliance, the Court may make any further orders as it deems fit, including staying proceedings until parties have attended counselling.",21,644,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00644
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"If couples are not able to resolve their issues and are contemplating divorce, we are also working on a Family Assist portal which will provide couples with links to marital counselling and allow reflection and also information so that couples can make an informed decision.",22,645,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00645
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Finally, should couples choose to proceed with divorce, within the divorce process, couples are given opportunities to resolve their issues and to u-turn on their decision.",23,646,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00646
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Yip Hon Weng had asked if the Ministry will consider mandating pre-divorce counselling for couples citing DMA. Ms Mariam Jaafar raised similar points on requiring divorcing couples to take parenting education courses and making counselling mandatory. With the amendments, all divorcing couples with minor children must attend MPP before filing for divorce. At MPP, counsellors may assess the couple's suitability for reconciliation and refer them for further support.",24,647,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00647
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Melvin Yong asked if this pre-divorce counselling could be extended to those who cite unreasonable behaviour. We agree it is good to do so but our priority at this point is to extend MPP to all divorcing couples with minor children, regardless of the fact they cite. We will explore extending pre-divorce counselling further at a later stage.",25,648,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00648
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I also fully agree with Dr Shahira Abdullah that religious organisations can play an important role in mediation and counselling and parties may choose to opt for counselling by religious organisations if they are of the same faith. I would like to thank Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for sharing the Syariah Court's experience with implementing the Marriage Counselling Programme. Indeed, it is through learning from the Syariah Court's positive experience that we have decided to introduce pre-divorce counselling.",26,649,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00649
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,Members also agree that it is key that families are supported throughout the divorce process.,27,650,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00650
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the Programme for Children, Ms Joan Pereira raised the importance to support all children, including the older ones. We fully agree and, as part of MPP, the counsellor would encourage parents to sign their children up for suitable programmes.",28,651,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00651
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"To Mr Louis Ng and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's queries on why the Programme for Children is not mandatory, what the types of interventions under the Programme for Children are and whether there can be a national body to harmonise programmes for all children affected by Muslim and civil divorce, I would first like to assure Members, such as Dr Shahira Abdullah, who also brought up the need for Muslim marriages to be supported, that MSF and MCCY work closely together to ensure that the programmes offered to all children affected by divorce are similar.",29,652,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00652
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"In addition, the Programme for Children is also available to children affected by Muslim divorce. There is, therefore, no need for a separate body to oversee this.",30,653,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00653
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The Programme for Children covers various component items.

2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"MSF had considered mandating all minor children whose parents are undergoing divorce to attend a programme to help them cope better with the divorce. However, we believe that parents, even as they undergo divorce, must still assume primary responsibility for their children's well-being rather than have the Government mandate a programme for their children. We are also mindful that mandating counselling for all children may also cause additional stress and that not all children may be ready for the programme.",32,655,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00655
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Lastly, on the issue of child access enforcement, I agree with Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim that children should not be used as a negotiating tool in their parents' quarrels and those who breach access orders must face consequences. Both Members also brought up the need for enforcement orders to be made judiciously, especially in the case of a term of imprisonment.",33,656,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00656
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I assure Members that the Court will take all aspects of the case into account in making its orders, including whether the child had refused access to the parent, and a term of imprisonment is intended to be imposed only on egregious cases of non-compliance. The Court may reverse the grant of care and control to the access parent if it is in the best interest of the child to do so. On orders to make-up access, as with all orders related to the child, the Court will make this order taking into consideration the best interest of the child.",34,657,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00657

2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"However, we have also heard different views raised by Members, particularly on whether we should make the divorce process more expeditious or whether doing so could lead to easier divorces and erode the institution of marriage.",36,659,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00659
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I fully agree with Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Melvin Yong that a balance must be struck between making it too difficult for couples to divorce and making it too easy to give up their commitment.",37,660,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00660
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Beyond non-legislative efforts to strengthen the family and upstream measures to help families facing stress, we also want to ensure that the divorce process affords parties opportunities to save their marriage and u-turn on their decision, and that the divorce process, even with the introduction of DMA, is not made easier nor faster.",38,661,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00661
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"For this reason, the safeguards to ensure the decision to divorce – that it is a considered one – remain. These include  (a) the three-year minimum marriage period before a divorce can be filed; (b) a minimum three-month period before divorce is finalised; and (c) that the existing five facts for parties remain for parties who prefer to rely on them.",39,662,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00662
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The divorce process also remains largely the same no matter which fact is cited, including DMA. In fact, citing DMA requires further submissions to the Court  (a) the reasons leading parties to conclude that their marriage has irretrievably broken down; (b) the efforts made by parties to reconcile; and (c) considerations given to the arrangements to be made in relation to the parties' children and financial affairs.",40,663,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00663
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"It is also for this reason that we will not be reducing the three-year minimum marriage period before a divorce can be filed, as Ms Carrie Tan has suggested. The three-year minimum period is an important safeguard to ensure that couples do not enter or exit a marriage lightly. The first year of marriage is often not an easy one, given the many transitions and adjustments for couples. The three-year minimum period will, thus, allow couples sufficient time to adjust, seek help and overcome difficulties, rather than simply leave the marriage just because things are difficult. If they truly wish to pursue divorce, the three-year minimum period will also allow them sufficient time to consider their decision carefully and also make attempts at reconciliation.",41,664,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00664
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Nonetheless, where there are legitimate reasons where a party may need to exit the marriage before the three-year minimum marriage period is up, the Women's Charter allows for that. In cases of exceptional hardship or depravity, parties may seek the Court's permission to file for divorce before the three-year minimum marriage period is up. However, where parties have made and failed at every effort to save their marriage and have no other option left but divorce, then there is a need and a place for DMA, in cases where parties agree on the divorce, to reduce acrimony.",42,665,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00665
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked why DMA is needed when the separation fact allows couples to divorce without apportioning fault. Divorcees who have filed for divorce on the simplified divorce track have shared with us in our engagements that though they had agreed on the divorce and ancillary matters, having to cite a fault-based fact did dredge up pain and hurt and the hurt deepened when parties read the affidavits from each other. They expressed how they wanted instead to be able to take joint responsibility for the marital breakdown instead of citing fault. They also told us that they found it difficult to rely on the separation fact as they felt that their lives were put on hold during the separation period and they could not move on. This was not good for their well-being.",43,666,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00666
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"It was also not good for their children's well-being because, try as they might, they admitted they could not focus on their children until the divorce was finalised. In the meantime, the children were exposed to the tensions in their relationship during the separation. DMA, therefore, allows such couples to jointly take responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage and heal and to move on from the divorce.",44,667,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00667
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan raised concerns as to whether DMA would effectively reduce acrimony, given parties must submit the reasons leading them to conclude the marriage has irretrievably broken down and they may disagree on matters concerning their children and finances. It is inevitable that, in certain cases, even with DMA, the couple will still face acrimony in the divorce process. However, providing the option for parties to jointly take responsibility rather than pinning the blame solely on one party would more likely set the frame and mindset for a less acrimonious and conflictual process. Thereafter, when parties proceed to the ancillary discussion, they are more likely to do so without the resentment of either having to bear full blame for the divorce or the pain of having to dredge up past hurts. Having jointly taken responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage, they can begin ancillary discussions more amicably.",45,668,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00668
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I would like to emphasise again and assure Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Yip Hon Weng that DMA differs from the no-fault divorce that we see in other jurisdictions.",46,669,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00669
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Unlike other overseas regimes where parties are not required to prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down, or where the filing for divorce by one party is sufficient to prove the marriage has irretrievably broken down, DMA is a sixth fact to prove the sole ground of divorce and it is done through an agreement that cites  one, reasons for the breakdown; two, efforts at reconciliation; and three, considerations for children and financial matters.",47,670,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00670
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"One party cannot unilaterally divorce the other. Some jurisdictions have removed the ability for a party to contest the proceedings.

2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,I would also like to assure Ms Sylvia Lim that we do not expect the number of divorces to increase significantly with the introduction of DMA. Spikes or long-term increase in divorce rates occur when the regime switches from fault-based to non-fault-based. We had made this transition in 1980 from a purely fault-based regime to a hybrid regime with no-fault grounds and we had introduced a Simplified Divorce Track in 2015. We saw no significant increase in divorce then.,49,672,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00672
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Members also raised queries on the divorce-related proposals. Regarding the details of DMA, Ms Hany Soh asked what reasons are acceptable to substantiate that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. This could include reasons, such as a deep-seated difference in values, and the intention is to avoid reasons that point blame only at one party, and children should not be cited as the reason for divorce. In fact, as Dr Shahira Abdullah has pointed out, one of the aims of DMA is to spare children the pain of having their parents make, prove and disprove allegations against each other’s misdeeds, so children are better able to cope with the divorce.",50,673,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00673
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Ms Ng Ling Ling asked how the Court would assess if a marriage is still reconcilable and whether MSF would be able to make recommendations to the Court. Mr Yip Hon Weng similarly asked if the assessment would involve professionals in family matters. Ms Sylvia Lim expressed concerns about whether DMA would lower the threshold for divorce, compared to the other five facts. Ultimately, the legal test for the granting of the divorce is the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. There are, currently, five facts with their own respective requirements. DMA is a broad ground, but parties will still have to meet the threshold of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. If parties cite evidence relating to one of the five established facts, but do not quite meet the prescribed requirements, it remains open to the Court to grant the divorce on the grounds of DMA. But before doing so, the Court will have to assess the facts carefully, bearing in mind that a divorce cannot be granted under DMA if there is a reasonable possibility of reconciliation.",51,674,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00674
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The Court will have to carefully consider whether or not to depart from the requirements of one of the five established facts, taking into account the specific circumstances of the case. DMA is a different fact on which you can obtain a divorce, but it is not an easier fact.",52,675,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00675
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The Court will have to assess the agreement based on the matters set out in the statement of particulars submitted by parties to the Court, which contains the three requirements needed by DMA, and make an assessment that the efforts detailed suffice to satisfy the parties-centric test that parties have made best efforts and have done all things necessary to attempt reconciliation. This is not present in the current five facts, including forced separation with or without consent. All these represent a paradigm shift that is different from, but not necessarily easier than, the current five facts. Over time, the Courts will develop case law on DMA. In all cases, parties have to meet the three-year time bar before they can apply for divorce. A party who relies on DMA will thus not necessarily be able to obtain a divorce sooner than a party who relies on adultery, desertion or unreasonable behaviour. It all depends on the facts.",53,676,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00676
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"For couples with minor children, they will have to attend MPP at the DSSA or FAM@FSC before filing for divorce or filing a counterclaim when served with divorce papers. We will enhance MPP to encourage couples to consider reconciliation, if possible. For couples who are open to reconciliation, a counsellor can help to support them through this process and, otherwise, the couple may proceed to divorce should they wish to do so. At the point of filing, should the Court assess that reconciliation is still a reasonable possibility, the Court may refer the couple for counselling at DSSA or FAM@FSC. After counselling, parties may continue with the divorce process should they choose to do so.",54,677,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00677
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Ms Joan Pereira similarly raised concerns on the submission of efforts to reconcile to the Court. In particular, Ms Pereira was concerned that this would add tension to an already strained relationship. The premise of DMA is to allow divorcing couples to come together and help a broken relationship without further strain. We expect that couples who cite DMA would have discussed their issues and how to resolve the dissolution of the marriage in an amicable manner. It is for this reason that the fact is founded on mutual agreement. If there is no consensus on all matters, it is highly unlikely that the couple would opt for this fact. The application, therefore, gives the couple space to discuss, communicate and resolve all issues, including reconciliation efforts, before presenting this application by mutual agreement to the Court.",55,678,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00678
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"To Ms Hany Soh’s query on whether DMA may only be cited on the Simplified Track and if divorces filed citing another fact can later be allowed to proceed on an amended claim under DMA, we envisage that most parties who cite DMA would file on the Simplified Track. However, DMA is not limited only to the Simplified Track, and those on the standard track may choose to cite DMA as well. As for whether parties who originally cited another fact can later be allowed to amend their claim and cite DMA, parties can apply for leave to amend the claim, subject to fulfilling the requirements of the Family Justice Rules.",56,679,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00679

Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked how long the process will take from the time divorce is filed and if the couple can appeal the Court’s decision. The average duration taken depends on the track that the divorce application proceeds on. For couples who contest the divorce or ancillary matters, the duration varies and could take some time. For couples who divorce on the Simplified Track, the time taken from filing to the grant of the interim judgment is approximately six to 12 weeks. Thereafter, there would be another minimum period of three months to the final judgment.",57,680,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00680
2022-01-10-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"We envisage that couples who cite DMA would likely file for divorce on the Simplified Track, but citing DMA instead of the existing five facts would not change the duration in any way. As for appeals, as this is a consent application, it is unlikely that there should be an appeal. And should one party change their mind, they can apply to set aside the grant of the Interim Judgment.",58,681,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00681

Ms Sylvia Lim also asked if the Court would act as a watchdog, in cases of vulnerable spouses who may be coerced into agreeing into a divorce under DMA and to unfavourable terms under the divorce relating to their children and their financial affairs. As I have said earlier, we rely on family lawyers to prevent such cases. In addition, the mandatory parenting programme or MPP, which I have been referring to, is a mandatory pre-filing programme for parents and this can act as a safeguard against such instances, as the counsellor may identify and assist such spouses. Indeed, for an agreement to be made under DMA, the Court must, amongst other things, assess that parties are acting voluntarily and have the requisite knowledge of the terms.",60,683,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00683

In a case where one party refuses to attend MPP, the other party will still be able to proceed with the filing of the divorce after they have themselves completed MPP. As for the perpetrator, he or she must attend the MPP if he or she wishes to file a counterclaim to put forth his or her points relating to the divorce and ancillary matters to the Court.

As to increasing the number of complimentary sessions for parties to carry out supervised access at DSSAs, there are no plans to do so as the intention is to foster a sense of responsibility in parents in managing their own relationship to co-parent effectively, by requiring them to contribute a sum for supervised access.

The Legal Aid Bureau also has a merits test in order to ensure that legal aid is not given for frivolous, unmeritorious claims. Thus, it is not just about ensuring that those who need it get legal help for access matters but that the manner in which they conduct the case and the merits of their position in the case are reasonable.

The Courts will only order the bailiff’s assistance in cases where their presence is absolutely necessary, and not in all cases. To safeguard the child’s well-being, the bailiff will be accompanied by the applicant, usually the other parent. Where required, the bailiff is also empowered to activate Auxiliary Police Officers for support. It is pertinent to note that the same powers exist in the Guardianship of Infants Act and are available to all parents and guardians of a child.

We had considered this. However, while women are in a much better position today than they were many years ago, we recognise that, even today, in a marriage, it is more likely for a wife to give up her career to care for her family, while her husband continues working. And this means that post-divorce, women tend to be financially more vulnerable.",69,692,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00692

While we want to move towards gender-neutrality, those who are more vulnerable must be protected. In any case, the Courts refrain from granting high amounts of maintenance to wives who are able to work, even if they had not worked or stopped working for some years. The Courts' goal is to award reasonable maintenance that will meet the financial needs of the wife until she can secure for herself some form of employment and adjust to her post-divorce situation.",70,693,2022-01-10-T-011-S-00693

At the same time, divorcees with shared care and control of children have an equal right to list their children in their flat application.

2022-01-10-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her clarification. There are many ongoing efforts and non-legislative ones to encourage the mainstreaming of the roles of the father and the mother, like what the Member has suggested. For instance, MOE, in its Character Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum talks about the roles that different family members play and they encourage children and students not to have stereotyped views on what a father and mother's roles should be.

2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Today, for betting and sweepstake duties, it is not a specific offence for a taxpayer to file an incorrect statement. If any prosecution is to take place for false filing of returns for betting and sweepstake duties, we rely on general criminal law, as in the Penal Code, which has a penalty designed to apply generally. On the other hand, the filing of incorrect returns for private lotteries duty and casino tax has each been made a specific offence. Likewise, for the filing of incorrect returns in connection with other taxes, like income tax or GST. So, this Bill proposes that the filing of an incorrect statement for betting and sweepstake duties will be a specific offence with a penalty that is consistent with similar specific offences in the other tax laws.",8,752,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00752

For failing to file a return, a betting operator could face a fine of up to $500 and a private lottery promoter could face a fine of $1,000. The same offence in the Income Tax Act and GST Act attracts a fine of up to $5,000. This Bill proposes that, for gambling duties, the fine for non-filing of returns will be up to $5,000, aligned with the Income Tax Act and GST Act.",9,753,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00753

2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"My speech today will focus largely on the related amendments to the Casino Control Act, which I believe to be the most significant change within this Bill.

2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Speak of gambling and some of the images that appear in my mind are the advertisements run by the National Council on problem gambling featuring the 2012 TV commercial where a man was asking his daughter for her piggy bank and saying, ""One more try and I will give it all back"". Or the other advertisement featuring Andy, whose father bet all his savings on Germany.",3,769,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00769
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"All these advertisements were the subject of numerous light-hearted parodies and spoofs, especially after Germany won the World Cup in 2014. The issue of problem gambling and the social ills associated with it are a serious one that deserves our utmost priority whenever the topic of gambling is discussed. To this end, while there may be visible economic benefits from the investment and expansion of the two new Integrated Resorts (IRs), we should always bear in mind the less visible social costs and risks of negative externalities associated with an expanded gambling scene in Singapore.",4,770,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00770
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I recognise that casino entry levies have been raised in 2019 and this has resulted in visits made by Singapore Citizens and PRs falling to 2.7% of the adult population in FY2019 from 4% in FY2018. As a result of COVID-19, however, I wonder if and how much did visitorship increase as a result of border restrictions. Further, to those at higher risk of problem gambling, the higher entry levy could instead spur them to raise their bets to cover the additional cost of entry.",5,771,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00771
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"So, I do hope that the Government will continue to tighten the safeguards not just against casino visitorship for locals, but to other forms of gambling as well, particularly online gambling. I have been receiving weekly SMSes and WhatsApp messages inviting me to online casinos, for example, and I am sure a number of Members would have as well. And just last month, the news about three brothers operating an illegal gambling syndicate that collected a weekly revenue of at least $1 million suggests that urgent action needs to be taken to address the shadow gambling scene in Singapore as well.",6,772,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00772
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Moving on to the legalised aspects of things, gambling or betting taxes, alongside tobacco and liquor excise duties, play a not insignificant role in the Government's operating revenues over the years. In absolute terms, I note that betting taxes for FY2019, which is prior to the onset of COVID-19, account for $2.6 billion in Government revenues. Even with the onset of COVID-19, with suspension of betting activity during the circuit breaker period and the sharp fall in tourist arrivals affecting visitorship, the estimated FY2020 betting tax revenue was at $1.8 billion. This is larger than the contribution from tobacco excise duties of $1.2 billion in FY2019 and $1.4 billion in FY2020.",7,773,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00773
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In the Budget Statement last year, the Government shared that betting taxes are estimated to increase by a significant 30.4% to $2.4 billion in FY2021. Yet, at the same time, revenues from betting taxes have been relatively range-bound over the past decade, with contributions from betting taxes not too different in FY2010 at about $2.3 billion. In fact, I observe that the relative share of betting taxes to the Government's operating revenues has broadly been declining over the last 20 years, from close to 6% of revenues in FY2002 to 3% of revenues in FY2021.",8,774,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00774
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Given the social objective of avoiding excessive consumption of areas, such as betting, tobacco and liquor, I strongly believe that there is room for betting taxes to be raised. I recognise, of course, that part of the consequential amendments to this Bill is the raising of casino taxes, a point which I will revisit shortly in my speech. I note that the last time betting duty rates on lotteries were raised was more than seven years ago in July 2014, from 25% to 30% of gross bets. Would the Government consider raising betting duty rates and other associated gambling duty rates in the near-term in this regard?",9,775,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00775
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I will next touch on amendments to the Casino Control Act, the most notable of which, in my view, is the raising of casino tax rates, which are slated to take effect from 1 March 2022. I am supportive of the raising of casino tax rates and my first question is  what are the Government's expectations of the additional revenues from higher casino taxes, not just in the next financial year, but over the next decade?",10,776,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00776
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I ask this because, back when the two IRs were awarded, the Government had committed not to raise the casino tax for at least 15 years. As we are coming to the end of the moratorium in February 2022, the Government will also be providing a moratorium on the new casino tax rates, this time, for a 10-year period. As such, I believe the Government would, presumably, have conducted a comprehensive assessment as to the effect of the higher casino tax rates, as this rate cannot be changed in the next decade.",11,777,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00777
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Therefore, a second related question is whether the Government can share its key considerations and deliberations before finally arriving at the current tiered casino tax rates of 8% and 12% of the gross gaming revenue (GGR) for premium gaming and 18% and 22% for mass gaming respectively. The recency of COVID-19 and the significant curtailment of visitor arrivals into Singapore could lead some quarters to question the sustainability of the higher casino tax rates, in the sense of whether or not the tax rate increase could place an onerous burden on the two casino operators, amidst ongoing uncertainties, given the effects of COVID-19. But if we take a step back, I would argue that higher casino tax rates are not only long overdue but could have room to grow in future.",12,778,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00778
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I am reminded of the buzz that surrounded the opening of the two IRs back in 2010, which have, no doubt, enhanced Singapore's position as a tourist destination and the two operators have also done well for themselves, surprising many back in those days, given how both IRs have achieved success very early on in their operations.",13,779,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00779
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"According to an article in My Paper in June 2010, the late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew shared that Marina Bay Sands will probably take three to seven years to reach a capacity that can help spur Singapore's tourism and convention industries. The late Mr Sheldon Adelson, former Chairman of Las Vegas Sands, however, said that Minister Mentor Lee was being a little too pessimistic and the property would be up and running at full speed the next year.",14,780,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00780
2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Adelson was proven right in the end and, I believe, even surpassed his own expectations. He shared in a statement in 2011 that Marina Bay Sands (MBS) had generated over US$1 billion of adjusted property EBITDA in just its first 12 months of operation, which is a record not only for any property in the history of Sands, but a record for any property in the history of the industry.",15,781,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00781

Both properties continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow today, which will, in all likelihood, recover alongside Singapore's tourism industry.",16,782,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00782

In this context, could there have been room for our casino tax rates to be higher? This, considering also the strong profitability of both IRs, where the recent impact from COVID-19 notwithstanding, both IRs have, historically, generated 40% to 50% EBITDA margins since their opening.",17,783,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00783

2022-01-10-T-014,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The third point I would like to raise in relation to the Casino Control Act is related to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) I filed in November where I had asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, given COVID-19 disruptions to the hospitality industry, whether there are any changes to the timeline investment commitment and nature of the S$9 billion combined investment commitment by the two IRs. Back in 2019, the Government noted that, in view of the substantial investment of $9 billion by the two IRs and to provide business certainty, the Government had agreed to extend the exclusivity period for the two casinos to end 2030, if no other casinos are to be introduced during this period,",19,785,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00785

That much is clear, given Sands has shared that they may not be able to meet the target 2025 completion deadline they had previously indicated, even though completion was only required by April 2027; while Genting Singapore had announced in early 2021 that it would delay development of its RWS 2.0 expansion project until 2022.",20,786,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00786

Can the Minister clarify under what circumstances will gambling duties be considered incompatible with the purposes of the Act? Further, the Minister may delegate the exercise of his or her powers in relation to remission to a Commissioner or public officer.

The new section 14(2) limits the amount of penalty tax that can be imposed to 50% of the amount of gambling duties outstanding. I agree that the amount of penalty tax should not be excessive for an individual. That said, can the Minister share what enforcement tools are available to the Ministry for the recovery of gambling duties if these remained unpaid even after the maximum amount of penalty tax has been reached? Can the Minister also share what softer measures are available for the Ministry to work with an indebted individual to meet his or her debts?",3,795,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00795
2022-01-10-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final point is the effect of the present Bill on Singapore's public policy on gambling.

2022-01-10-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While the cases concerned the enforcement of gambling debts which were incurred abroad, a relevant issue considered in these cases is the local policy position on gambling.

2022-01-10-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Gambling Duties Bill is introduced with the intention of improving the consistency of tax administration and enforcement across gambling-related taxes.",1,801,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00801
2022-01-10-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"With the unprecedented roll-out of various assistance schemes, free vaccination drives and increased healthcare burden amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many Singaporeans have come to acknowledge the importance of having adequate Government revenue and savings in our reserves. There is also greater scrutiny of the Government's fiscal policies on how monies are spent and on the sources of income. Detailed bookkeeping is, thus, paramount. It helps to minimise discrepancies and misappropriation of funds. It is part of good governance. I appreciate the details on short levying, erroneous funding and overpayment in the various sections, as well as the recovering and refunding of shortfalls. I have four queries on the Bill.",2,802,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00802
2022-01-10-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, will the active detection and enforcement of actions against underpayments and other discrepancies require significantly more manpower and resources? How will the Ministry ensure that IRAS is able to cope with the additional responsibilities? How does IRAS fulfil the complex requirements of bookkeeping and following up with discrepancies? Are there plans to deploy smart technology to support their operations? If so, are there safeguards to ensure that such information will only be used for the purposes of collection of gambling duties and that the data is not compromised?",3,803,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00803
2022-01-10-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how will this Bill affect Singapore Sweep retailers and vendors? My main concern is for the small-time vendors and franchisees who sell Big Sweep and lottery tickets in the heartlands. Would the amendments to the tax administration scheme require any action on their part? Can the Ministry clarify whether this tax is already incorporated into the costs that they incurred from obtaining the selling rights and tickets from Singapore Pools? How will this affect them, especially with regard to their earnings?",4,804,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00804

2022-01-10-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Lastly, we need to be mindful of the costs involved as a result of the Bill changes. A concern is that costs may be wasted on applications for assessment, reassessment of liability and appeals, based on similar facts from earlier cases. Furthermore, decisions and appeals made publicly available may allow appellants to discern whether to appeal, if the said appellants are made aware of previous decisions and facts hitherto. As such, will information of the appeals and decisions by the Commissioner or the Minister be published and made publicly available?",6,806,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00806

2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"When the IRs were first introduced, we provided an exclusivity period of 10 years, during which the Government would not introduce any other casinos.

2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"In 2019, the two IRs committed around S$9 billion in investments to build new world-class tourism and MICE facilities. Marina Bay Sands (MBS) will introduce a state-of-the-art entertainment arena which would host world-class performances and an iconic new tower comprising hotel and rooftop attractions. There will also be additional MICE space to host exhibitions and conventions.",3,812,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00812

It will also redevelop its waterfront promenade and introduce a driverless transport system along the Sentosa Boardwalk to improve accessibility into Sentosa. These investments will enhance the attractiveness and tourism appeal of Singapore, amid stronger competition for travellers post-pandemic. Singaporeans can also look forward to more lifestyle and entertainment options.",4,813,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00813
2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"To Mr Gan Thiam Poh's question on the potential increase in economic contribution, based on our initial projections, the IRs' expansions are expected to contribute S$500 million annually to GDP in a steady state. The expansions will also create up to 5,000 new jobs directly and benefit local businesses, especially in the construction and services sector.",5,814,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00814
2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"As an example, last week, I witnessed the launch of the Resorts World Sentosa and the National University of Singapore (NUS) Living Laboratory project. The living lab brings together NUS' capabilities as a leading global research institute and RWS' strengths as a world-class tourism destination. The project focuses on biodiversity and energy conservation and will help preserve and restore our natural heritage. This is in line with our Singapore Green Plan 2030 and Sentosa Development Corporation's plans to transform Sentosa into a carbon-neutral destination by 2030. Again, it will, in turn, enhance Sentosa's appeal as a tourism and conservation destination.",6,815,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00815
2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"These are hefty investments and a further extension of the exclusivity period was required, as the casino is a small but essential part of the IR in that it makes the larger development and slew of activities which I mentioned earlier financially viable. The duration of the exclusivity period was arrived at after considering factors, such as what the parties could offer, the social impact, competitive dynamics and what the IRs deemed necessary from a financial viability viewpoint.",7,816,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00816
2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),Clause 46(1) amends section 41 of the Casino Control Act to introduce this exclusivity period.

2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"For the new attractions and facilities in the expanded IRs to remain commercially viable, the Government also announced in April 2019 that the IRs would be allowed to have additional gaming machines and the option to purchase additional Approved Gaming Area, or AGA. However, even if the IRs fully utilised their options, AGA, as a proportion of total floor area, would be reduced from 3.2% to 2.4%. This is because non-gaming areas will expand by a much larger amount.",9,818,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00818

However, with the disruption that COVID-19 has had on the construction industry, both IRs have indicated that there will be potential delays in the completion of their projects. And this is not altogether surprising or unique to this project or this industry. COVID-19 has impacted construction timelines, both locally and globally. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve and, in fact, is evolving, and the IRs' expansions are complex multi-year projects, the full extent of the delay is not yet clear.",11,820,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00820

2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether the Bill will create significant additional resourcing needs for IRAS. It will not. First, the Bill consolidates and streamlines laws that are, currently, contained within the BSDA and PLA. So, many of these functions are already performed by IRAS today. Second, where there are new functions like electronic serving of notices, or the ability to enter and search premises for the enforcement of betting and sweepstake duties, these functions are not new to IRAS. IRAS, currently, performs these functions for the other taxes that it administers and has the requisite capabilities.",2,824,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00824
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Yip Hong Weng also asked if IRAS has plans to use smart technology to support its operations. IRAS already does this and will continue to do so. The consequential amendment to the IRAS Act in this Bill to provide for an electronic service system paves the way for e-services for betting and casino operators and private lottery promoters. More generally, IRAS is developing new artificial intelligence applications to enhance and automate key processes for the taxes that it administers. IRAS will continue to improve on its administration and enforcement to keep it efficient and effective. In fact, fiscal year 2020, across all taxes, IRAS has kept its cost of collection low, at less than one cent for every dollar of tax revenue collected.",3,825,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00825
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Louis Ng asked what enforcement tools are available to IRAS for the recovery of unpaid gambling duties and where the maximum penalties have already been reached. He also asked what softer measures are available for an indebted individual to meet his tax obligations. The taxpayers for the three types of betting taxes – casino tax, private lotteries duty and betting and sweepstake duties – are business providers of gaming and, generally, not individuals acting in their individual capacity. So far, these taxpayers have been compliant. If the need arises to recover unpaid betting taxes, the tools available for IRAS include suing the taxpayer or appointing someone who holds money for the taxpayer, such as a bank, to pay the sum to the Commissioner. If an individual is indebted, IRAS will explore a payment arrangement with the indebted individual to meet his or her debts.",4,826,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00826
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As to Mr Yip Hon Weng's suggestion to require an appellant to pay costs to prevent frivolous applications for assessment, reassessment of liability and appeals, such frivolous applications are not an issue, currently, for betting taxes. So, we do not charge taxpayers who apply to IRAS for revising their tax assessments.",5,827,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00827
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how we protect taxpayer data. Clause 43 of the Bill ensures that all taxpayer data collected by IRAS for the gambling duties will be regarded as secret and confidential. A corresponding provision already exists in most other tax Acts. It is an offence to share confidential information except in certain specified circumstances. Authorised persons who are granted access to taxpayer data are required to make and subscribe to a declaration of secrecy. Even without a specific confidentiality provision, taxpayer income information is protected by the common law duty of confidentiality, the Official Secrets Act and the data protection regime under the Public Sector (Governance) Act.",6,828,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00828
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Mr Louis Ng asked about the remission of gambling duties. This pertains to clause 12(1) of the Bill which provides for remission when the gambling duties are incompatible with the purposes of the Act.,7,829,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00829
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This Ministerial power to remit taxes is a provision that is present in other existing tax Acts like the GST Act, the Income Tax Act, the Property Tax Act and the Stamp Duties Act. So, it is a generic provision that we have in our tax Acts. While it is unlikely that such remission power will be invoked for gambling duties, we have, nevertheless, provided for this remission power for gambling duties in the remote event that such an unforeseen situation should arise.",8,830,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00830

2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether small-scale vendors and franchisees, especially those who sell Big Sweep and lottery tickets in the heartlands, will be affected. The changes only affect the betting operator or the private lottery promoter, rather than retailers. For the individual retailers, the amendments do not require any additional action on their part and, because there is no change in the rates of duty, the amendments will also not impact their earnings.",10,832,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00832
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Louis Chua asked if the Government would consider a raising of betting taxes, particularly with regard to sweepstakes and private lotteries. These are not being contemplated as part of this Bill. There is no change that we are proposing for now, but we will continue to review the betting tax regime, as we do for other taxes on a regular basis. Our objective is to ensure that betting taxes are high enough to manage gambling demand and, at the same time, that operators and promoters can compete effectively against illegal gambling operators.",11,833,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00833
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I turn now to Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Gan Thiam Poh's questions on the revenue collection associated with the changes in this Bill.,12,834,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00834
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the casino tax, Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the gaming revenue from local and foreign visitors for premium and mass gaming. We do not collect data on the proportion of casino tax from local and foreign visitors. This is because casino tax does not differentiate between whether the individual concerned is a local or a foreigner.",13,835,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00835
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I am unable, unfortunately, to share the details of casino tax collections. As there are only two casinos in Singapore, the Government is unable to disclose the amount of casino tax revenue or the breakdown between premium and mass gaming. Casino tax revenue is included under a broader classification of betting taxes which also includes taxes from lotteries, horse and sports betting and fruit machines. The total revenue from all betting taxes was $2.6 billion in FY2019 and $1.8 billion in FY2020. The numbers are still being finalised for FY2021 but we do not expect them to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels in the short term.",14,836,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00836
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As for Mr Gan Thiam Poh's question on the projected increase in revenue with the expansion and increase in economic contribution, I believe this has been covered by Minister of State Alvin Tan when he talked about the expected economic benefits of IRs in his speech. The increase in tax revenue would depend on how well the IRs do after their additional investments.",15,837,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00837
2022-01-10-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, in response to Mr Louis Ng's query, this Bill consolidates the existing laws on the levy and collection of taxes on lawful betting and lotteries but it does not impact what Singapore's public policy position on gambling is. We have, on multiple occasions, articulated our approach towards problem gambling and this position remains unchanged.",16,838,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00838

2022-01-10-T-014,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Number one is, with COVID-19, whether endemic or pandemic, there is a lot less travel, especially in business travel.

2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Ms Denise Phua for her question. This is with regard to the overall tourism strategy and our strategy with regard to MICE. I would say that, as Members are aware, the tourism sector, be it the aviation sector or the associated sectors, have been hard hit by COVID-19 due to travel restrictions and safe management measures (SMMs). But that does not mean that we should hold back or not invest in our tourism capabilities and capacity for the long run. This is because the tourism landscape, as I mentioned earlier, is getting competitive and we must position ourselves for when tourism upticks, for when regular travel resumes and for when events, such as MICE, tourism, start to resume some form of normalcy.",1,846,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00846
2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Last year, we were preparing the tourism and MICE sectors for such an eventuality and, so, we undertook four MICE pilots and those pilots went well. This puts us on a strong footing.",2,847,2022-01-10-T-014-S-00847
2022-01-10-T-014,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the IR expansions, these are also necessary, as the Member noted earlier, to put the IRs in a good position as a tourism enabler for Singapore in the long run.

2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),The Corporate Registers (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill covers four sets of amendments to the Companies Act and the Limited Liability Partnerships Act. Two sets of amendments introduce new requirements. The other two clarify existing requirements.,2,860,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00860
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"These amendments will strengthen Singapore's corporate governance regime and affirm our commitment to combating money laundering, terrorism financing and other threats to the integrity of the international financial system.",3,861,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00861
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The amendments will also bring us into closer alignment with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, of which Singapore is a member. FATF is an inter-governmental organisation that sets international standards to prevent global money laundering and terrorism financing and the harm that is caused to financial ecosystems and society at large.",4,862,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00862

2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Our Acts today do not require the nominator to be identified, as he or she is not the shareholder on record. However, as the nominee shareholder typically acts on the instructions of the nominator, the lack of transparency on the identity of these persons who actually control the shares is an area of concern internationally.",9,867,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00867
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The first set of amendments today aims to address these concerns and align our legislation with FATF recommendations, by requiring both local and foreign companies in Singapore to, first, keep a non-public register of nominee shareholders and their nominators; and second, to update their register within seven days of being informed by the nominee. This will ensure that nominators, who are effectively controllers of a company, are properly identified, in line with the international standards.",10,868,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00868

However, no timeframe is specified for local companies to update their register when there is a change in particulars of the nominee director or their nominator. Specifying a seven-day time limit for this provides clarity on the expected timeline and will ensure that the register is updated in a timely manner. Clause 2(f) of the Bill provides for this amendment.",21,879,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00879

2022-01-10-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, this Bill gives effect to the Financial Action Task Force's recommendations on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. Preventing the illicit movement of funds is key to Singapore's role as a respected international financial hub and I am glad we are taking steps to strengthen our protections. I have three points of clarification.",1,885,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00885
2022-01-10-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, can the Minister clarify the reasons why directors with executive control and the CEO must be listed in the register if no registrable controller is identified? Why are these two groups specifically listed? Does this mean that no other person can have executive control and is not relevant to be disclosed in the register? Further, this requirement seems repetitive, given that the information about directors and CEOs are already filed with ACRA.",2,886,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00886
2022-01-10-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, can Minister provide more clarity on the definition of ""nominee shareholders""? What would be necessary before someone is considered ""accustomed""? The amendment states that the nominee must also receive dividends on behalf of the principal shareholder. Is it sufficient that there is an agreement for the nominee to receive dividends, or must there be an actual distribution into the hands of the nominee? If it is the latter, this creates a problem where it is impossible to clarify nominee status for companies that do not issue dividends.",3,887,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00887
2022-01-10-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third and finally, can the Ministry share how it will support small businesses in complying with these new regulations? The new regulations apply not only to multinational corporations or financial institutions but also small local businesses. For small businesses, these rules can be complex and require proportionally larger costs to comply with. How will the Ministry support our small businesses to ensure these regulations do not unfairly burden them?",4,888,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00888
2022-01-10-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In summary, I seek clarification on three things  the need to list directors or CEOs in the register, the definition of nominee shareholders and the ways the Ministry will support small businesses in complying with the new regulations. Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",5,889,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00889
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Corporate Registers (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill seeks to amend certain laws relating to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. The proposed amendments are a result of recommendations made by the inter-governmental body, known as the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF. These amendments concern administrative requirements applicable to companies in Singapore.",1,890,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00890
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, the Bill is a step in the right direction for Singapore as it underlines our commitment to being a responsible global player in financial services, one that is committed to a transparent, rules-based, global order and, hence, able to derive economic benefits from that order. My speech will support the Bill but raise questions and suggestions.",2,891,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00891
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore is committed to the global effort to combat transnational crime as a member of FATF and a founder member of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. The Singapore Government's stated aims have been to detect, deter and prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and to protect the integrity of its financial system from illegal activities and elicit fund flows.",3,892,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00892
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Singapore has continued, I note, to make progress to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in the latest 2019 FATF Mutual Evaluation Report, or MER. As a result of this progress, Singapore has been re-rated on several Recommendations, that is, Nos 3, 23, 24 and 25. Take, for instance, the amendment of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, which came into effect in April 2019. The increase in fines through these Acts were considered sufficiently dissuasive in the said MER, which led Singapore to be re-rated as compliant with Recommendation 3, bringing Singapore closer to its goal of deterring money laundering and terrorist financing activities.",4,893,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00893
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, Singapore has not addressed all the identified deficiencies and several areas for improvement still exist. In order to strengthen Singapore's measures to fight money laundering and terrorism financing, the Corporate Registers (Amendment) Bill is necessary to keep Singapore's legal regime aligned with FATF's standards and recommendations.",5,894,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00894
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have three broad points to make on this Bill. The first point concerns the different timelines for local and foreign companies in updating their registers of key personnel. The amendment Bill, if passed, will result in local companies having to update their register of nominee directors within seven days, instead of the 14 days under section 173A of the Companies Act, while foreign companies may update their register of members within 30 days.",6,895,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00895
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The Bill originally intended that foreign companies should update the register of members within 14 days. However, during the public consultation phase, the feedback was that this would be a challenge for foreign companies, especially if they have more than 50 members. While the feedback suggested that companies should be given 14 to 28 days, MOF and ACRA further extended the deadline to 30 days, stating that this would be aligned with the requirements in section 372 of the Companies Act. In other words, this feedback was accepted in the spirit of harmonising timelines in existing legal provisions. Indeed, this is a commendable, reasonable and consistent approach that avoids imposing multiple timelines and requirements on foreign companies.",7,896,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00896
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, feedback to amend requirements for local companies for consistency with existing legislation was not received in the same way. The amendment Bill, currently, intends for local companies to update their information on nominee directors and shareholders within seven days. With that being said, feedback from the consultation proposed that local companies should be given 14 days instead, as this would be line with section 173A of the Companies Act – which will really require a company to provide updates regarding changes to any appointment of directors, chief executive officer, secretaries, auditors and others within the period of 14 days. However, this feedback was not accepted. The implication is that local companies now have two timelines to follow  seven days to update particulars for nominee, directors; and 14 days for particulars of all other key personnel.",8,897,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00897
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This begs the following question  what is the basis for requiring that local companies must update their information and nominee directors within a seven-day period when there is already an existing requirement to update information on various key position holders within 14 days? Should this provision be accepted by this House, there would be two timelines for local companies, in contrast to foreign companies being uniformly subject to one timeline.",9,898,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00898
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The hon Minister Indranee Rajah stated earlier in her Second Reading speech that foreign companies may need more time to contact overseas stakeholders, directors, but local companies may also have some directors residing overseas, either on a long-term basis or who may be overseas at the relevant time. So, I am wondering why the timelines for both local and foreign companies cannot be harmonised.",10,899,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00899
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, my second point relates to the Government's plans to improve compliance with the other FATF recommendations. Singapore has made great progress in implementing Recommendation 24 on Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons through an amendment to the Companies Act in 2017 and further amendments in this Corporate Registers Bill before us. Singapore has strengthened its compliance with Recommendation 24 where Singapore was rated as ""largely compliant"".",11,900,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00900
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, Sir, the remaining other FATF recommendations which Singapore was found to be only ""partially compliant with"" are Recommendations 22, 28 and 35. Recommendation 22 concerns the application of customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs), such as the gambling and legal Industries. Recommendation 28 is about subjecting the aforementioned DNFBPs to regulatory and supervisory framework regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. Recommendation 35 relates to the available range of sanctions to do with parties that have failed to abide by anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures.",12,901,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00901
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Given that it is ostensibly the goal of this Bill to counter money laundering and terrorism financing concerns and recognising the increasingly sophisticated methods employed to launder money and finance terror activities, how does the Government intend to improve compliance with these three FATF Recommendations 22, 28 and 35?",13,902,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00902
2022-01-10-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, finally, I would like to raise some questions about the clarification of certain terms contained in the amendment Bill. These terms include ""individuals with executive control"", ""executive control"", and ""accustomed"". In their document published in response to key feedback received for this Bill, MOF and ACRA have stated that such terms are ""to be clarified"". As such, could the Minister advise when MOF and ACRA intend to provide such clarifications? I ask this, considering the need to avoid business uncertainty. Can such guidance be expected shortly upon the Bill's passage or coming into force?",14,903,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00903
2022-01-10-T-016,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Second Minister Indranee Rajah.,1,904,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00904
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Louis Ng and Mr Leon Perera for speaking on the Bill and for their support. Mr Louis Ng raised three points of clarification, which I will address in turn.",1,905,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00905
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, Mr Louis Ng asked about the rationale for identifying CEOs and directors with executive control to be listed in the Register of Registrable Controllers, if a company is unable to identify a registrable controller. As I had explained in my speech earlier, there have been situations where a company claimed to have no registrable controllers with significant interest or control. Currently, such companies would not be required to enter any particulars into the register of controllers.",2,906,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00906
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The intent of the Register of Registrable Controllers is to increase the transparency of natural persons who have beneficial ownership and control of companies. In situations where no registrable controllers are identified, persons with executive powers within the company are effectively exercising control. It is, therefore, necessary to include these persons in the Register if no other controller can be identified.",3,907,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00907
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Mr Louis Ng also asked if it is necessary to provide particulars of the CEO and the directors in the register of registrable controllers when ACRA may already have the information in other registers.,4,908,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00908
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The reality is that a company can have many directors, but not all of them exercise executive control over the company. The purpose of the new requirement is to ensure that companies identify the directors and CEOs with executive control, so that the beneficial owners are properly identified.",5,909,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00909
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Next, let me address Mr Louis Ng's clarification on the definition of a nominee shareholder.",6,910,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00910
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,A shareholder is considered to be a nominee if he fulfils the following two criteria in respect of the shares that he holds.,7,911,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00911
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, he is accustomed to, or under an obligation, to vote in accordance with the instructions of any other person. The word ""accustomed"" suggests some degree of habit – meaning that there must be some consistent pattern of behaviour of the nominee shareholder voting in accordance with the instructions or wishes of any other person – and occasional instances of such behaviour would not be sufficient to constitute ""accustomed"".",8,912,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00912
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second criterion is that he or she receives dividends on behalf of his or her nominator. Practically, it would suffice if the nominee is expected to receive the dividends on behalf of the nominator, even if the dividends are not eventually distributed.",9,913,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00913
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Our amendments are in line with FATF. I would also add that public companies listed in Singapore and their shareholders will not be subject to this new requirement, as provided for in the Fourteenth Schedule of the Companies Act.",10,914,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00914
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Lastly, Mr Louis Ng asked about the compliance cost of the new requirements and the support that Government will put in place. To be clear and, as mentioned in my speech earlier, out of the four sets of amendments in this Bill, two are clarifications on timelines and only two are new requirements.",11,915,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00915
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The new requirement to maintain a Register of Nominee Shareholders is unlikely to materially increase compliance costs, especially if the small businesses do not have nominee arrangements. Moreover, the responsibility on the company is only to maintain such a register, based on declarations by nominee shareholders. Companies will not be required to send notices to check if shareholders are nominees.",12,916,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00916
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The other new requirement is to identify individuals with the executive control of a company or LLP to be listed in the Register of Registrable Controllers, if they are unable to identify a registrable controller.",13,917,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00917
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Again, this is unlikely to increase compliance cost. I would also like to highlight that these new requirements will only apply to companies and LLPs. Small businesses that are set up as sole proprietorships or general partnerships will not be impacted by them.",14,918,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00918
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Government will help companies and LLPs to comply with the new requirements. ACRA will issue a Guidance on the new requirement of maintaining a Register of Nominee Shareholders. The Guidance will contain detailed instructions to clarify and explain the new requirements. For example, it will provide details on how a nominee shareholder and nominator can be identified and include a model template to support the maintenance of the register.",15,919,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00919
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,ACRA will also update the existing Guidance on the Register of Registrable Controllers for companies and LLPs to provide clarity on how these entities can identify persons with executive control as registrable controllers.,16,920,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00920
2022-01-10-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Leon Perera had a number of questions. The first one, I believe, relates to the different timeframes.",17,921,2022-01-10-T-016-S-00921

Hence, the strict measures will continue to apply to them. It will not matter if they are tennis coaches; the virus does not discriminate because it will impact you more severely if you are unvaccinated.",17,987,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00987

2022-01-10-T-018,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Despite our cautious approach to reopening, the heightened transmissibility of the Delta variant resulted in new clusters emerging by end August 2021. This put great pressure on our healthcare system. The number of cases was sustained at 3,000 per day, as mentioned by Minister Ong Ye Kung earlier, and, the serious cases, who had to be seen in hospitals, resulted in 100 to 170 cases occupying ICU beds each day.",19,989,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00989

2022-01-10-T-018,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"To stabilise the situation, we had to roll out revised healthcare protocols and tighten our SMMs again. But we were able to allow more activities to continue during this Stabilisation Phase, compared to the earlier Phase Two (Heightened Alert) period due to VDS.

But we need to decide whether we want to tighten up all our SMMs again, which would affect the lives and livelihoods of both the vaccinated and unvaccinated, or do we calibrate our measures so that we only tighten up for those who are unvaccinated and who would be more likely to impose strains on our healthcare system.",23,993,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00993

These include the removal of the concession for unvaccinated individuals to produce a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) result prior to participating in a VDS event or activity and the reduction of the exemption period for recovered persons to enter VDS settings from 270 days to 180 days.,25,995,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00995

The MTF subsequently announced on 14 December 2021 that up to 50% of those who can work from home will be allowed to return to the office from 1 January 2022 as we would be in a better position to ease the current default work-from-home posture with the WVM in place.",27,997,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00997

To strengthen our protection against a large wave of cases locally and to keep our workplace safe, the MTF announced that, from 15 January 2022, unvaccinated workers, barring those medically ineligible, will not be able to return to the workplace even with a negative PET result.",28,998,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00998

This is a reduction from the 52,000 reported on 19 December 2021, as we have seen more employees coming forward to get vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated employees, those aged 30 to 39 form the largest group at 16,000. Whilst a negative PET is an indicator that the person is not infected with COVID-19, the unvaccinated individual has no protection against the virus. And if you think about it, if all the 48,000 get COVID-19, it would, indeed, impact on our healthcare system.",29,999,2022-01-10-T-018-S-00999
2022-01-10-T-018,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),This decision was taken in consideration of many different factors and in consultation with many different stakeholders. This move was supported by the tripartite partners who recognised the public health imperative of vaccination and the urgency to sustain business activity to protect livelihoods. A fully vaccinated workforce would be able to operate more safely and sustainably.,30,1000,2022-01-10-T-018-S-01000

2022-01-10-T-018,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had adopted a special approach to fully cover the costs of COVID-19 medical treatment for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders (SC/PR/LTPHs) who had not recently travelled. This special approach was intended to avoid financial considerations adding to the public uncertainty and concern when COVID-19 was an emergent and unfamiliar disease.",32,1002,2022-01-10-T-018-S-01002
2022-01-10-T-018,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Today, the vaccines have since become widely administered and there is sufficient evidence that they confer protection to reduce the risk of serious illness and death. Those aged above 12 who remain unvaccinated by choice have decided to do so despite knowing that this places them at a higher risk of requiring costly inpatient care, which adds to the strain on our healthcare system. The special treatment of the Government fully covering the costs of COVID-19 medical treatment will, therefore, not apply to this group. This will also be the case for individuals aged above 18 who do not come forward for their booster within 270 days or nine months from their last dose.",33,1003,2022-01-10-T-018-S-01003

While the median bill size for COVID-positive patients receiving treatment in acute hospitals who require both ICU care and COVID-19 therapeutics is estimated to be about $25,000, access to means-tested Government subsidies and MediShield Life coverage can reduce the bill to about $2,000 to $4,000 for eligible Singaporeans in subsidised wards. SCs and PRs may also use their MediSave balance to help fund any remaining post-subsidy amount, subject to the claim limits that apply.",34,1004,2022-01-10-T-018-S-01004

This was almost 40% higher than the previous record set in August 1983. More than the average monthly August rainfall fell in western Singapore within three hours. The intense rain resulted in localised flash floods at two locations, namely, along Dunearn Road between Sime Darby Centre and Binjai Park with a flood depth of about 400 mm, and along Cashew Road leading to Upper Bukit Timah Road with a flood depth of about 150 mm. These localised flash floods lasted around 40 minutes at Dunearn Road and 30 minutes at Cashew Road.",3,1049,2022-01-10-T-021-S-01049

The fact remains that in dealing with a global pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe.",1,1054,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01054
2022-01-10-T-022,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"For this reason, we have continued to support global and regional efforts to tackle COVID-19. Singapore has been a member on WHO’s Executive Board for a three-year term since May 2019, and we have contributed to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment and the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund. We were an early supporter of vaccine multilateralism and coalesced support for the COVAX Facility, co-founding the Friends of the COVAX Facility group with Switzerland. MOH's Chief Health Scientist, Prof Tan Chorh Chuan, is Singapore’s representative on the COVAX Shareholders’ Council. Until the end of 2021, he also served as one of three Council representatives on the COVAX Market Sensitive Decisions Committee, which reviews proposed agreements with vaccine manufacturers to ensure reasonableness, acceptable level of reputation risks and availability of resources. We are a member of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator Facilitation Council, in our capacity as Chair of the Forum of Small States, where we have worked to ensure that the perspectives of small states are taken into account.",2,1055,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01055
2022-01-10-T-022,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Members would also be aware of the Singapore Government’s contributions of vaccines to countries in our region in their times of need. In July 2021, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Singapore would donate our vaccine allocation under the COVAX initiative to other countries. The Prime Minister further announced in October 2021 that Singapore had contributed our allocation of vaccines under the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund to other ASEAN Member States. We have shared vaccines, procured under the COVAX initiative, with our neighbours, including 122,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the Riau Islands province, and we have plans to further donate vaccine doses to neighbouring countries.",3,1056,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01056
2022-01-10-T-022,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"In addition to donating vaccines under the COVAX initiative, we have provided 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to Brunei; 20,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine and 100,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to Johor. We also entered into mutually beneficial dose sharing arrangements with Australia, Thailand and Brunei, where we sent 500,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to Australia, 122,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Thailand and 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to Brunei in September 2021. So far, we have received the same number of doses back from Australia to support our booster programme.",4,1057,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01057
2022-01-10-T-022,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"We have contributed in other ways beyond the supply of vaccines. For example, the Singapore Government sent more than 500 tonnes of liquid oxygen to Indonesia through our “Oxygen Shuttle” Programme and donated 200,000 diagnostic tests and 500,000 nasopharyngeal swabs to Thailand, as well as 200,000 Antigen Rapid Test kits to Vietnam. We worked with the Singapore Red Cross to distribute 200 oxygen concentrators to affected communities in Myanmar and contributed US$100,000 through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to the people of Myanmar when they faced a surge in COVID-19 cases. A Singapore nominee, former SCDF Assistant Commissioner Lee Yam Ming, has been elected and is serving as Executive Director of the AHA Centre since August 2021. Under his leadership, the AHA Centre has already facilitated the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of Myanmar.",5,1058,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01058
2022-01-10-T-022,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"In addition to assisting fellow ASEAN countries, we airlifted a consignment of 256 urgently needed oxygen cylinders to India and contributed medical supplies to fellow small island states, such as Fiji and Palau. We continue to share best practices and information on the virus, including sharing the source code of TraceTogether publicly, which have helped several countries develop their own contact tracing applications.",6,1059,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01059
2022-01-10-T-022,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"During the pandemic, we remained committed to maintaining our openness as a major logistics, transportation and energy hub. Our air and sea ports remained open to minimise global supply disruptions and ensure the uninterrupted flow of critical supplies, such as vaccines, medicines and food, which not only benefited Singapore but other countries as well. We also did not prohibit the export or transhipment of any goods through Singapore, including medical supplies in high demand, like N-95 respirators. Changi Airport’s continued operation has helped to facilitate the repatriation of many Singaporeans and students and enabled thousands of passengers to return home using Singapore as a transit point. Our efforts to keep our air and sea ports open despite COVID-19 will prevent the loss of strategic capabilities and our hard-earned position as a reliable transport hub. As a global maritime hub, we have also helped to vaccinate port workers and ship crew. Such moves have helped the countries in the region and beyond not only procure essential supplies during the pandemic but also ensured that we can all make a smoother recovery from it.",7,1060,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01060

Singapore remains fully committed to support the global fight against COVID-19. The WHO Director-General has called for 2022 to be the year when we end the acute stage of the pandemic. Singapore will work towards this goal by controlling the pandemic at home and, with our partners and international organisations, to strengthen the global health architecture and build pandemic preparedness and resilience. We are working with WHO and relevant partners, including through our Executive Board membership, to strengthen urban health emergency preparedness. This includes taking into account pandemic control in urban development, ensuring social support, continuity of education and synergising finance and health needs.",8,1061,2022-01-10-T-022-S-01061

2022-01-10-T-023,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider allowing singles to purchase HDB resale flats from the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) scheme so as to build a more inclusive community.,1,1066,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01066
2022-01-10-T-023,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model (a) whether singles will eventually be allowed to buy new or resale PLH flats; and (b) if so, what are the key considerations before current restrictions imposed on singles are adjusted.",1,1067,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01067
2022-01-10-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model is designed with the objective of keeping public housing in prime locations affordable and inclusive for Singaporeans.,1,1068,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01068
2022-01-10-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The eligibility criterion for buyers of a new PLH flat or a typical Build-To-Order (BTO) flat is the same. However, in order to keep PLH flat prices affordable for a wide range of Singaporeans, new PLH flats will be priced with additional subsidies, on top of the substantial subsidies already provided for BTO flats. Beyond the initial purchase, we also want to ensure that the prices of these flats remain within reach of Singaporeans when the PLH flats are sold subsequently on the open market.",2,1069,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01069
2022-01-10-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Without policy intervention, resale prices of PLH flats would likely increase beyond the reach of many Singaporeans. We will, therefore, require buyers of a PLH flat on the resale market to meet the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria, to ensure affordability and accessibility over a longer period of time while managing the demand for the limited supply of PLH flats. Singaporeans are familiar with the means-tested conditions in our BTO eligibility criteria which cover a broad range of Singaporean households. Today, more than eight in 10 Singaporeans are eligible to buy a subsidised flat.",3,1070,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01070
2022-01-10-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As the PLH model is a new model restricted to prime areas, there will not be many flats launched under this model in the initial phase and, therefore, it is necessary at present to set guidelines for priority. Applying the BTO eligibility criteria gives priority to Singaporean families, who may need more space because they have bigger households. They include singles who can form a family unit with their parent(s), or single sibling(s) whose parents have passed on. These singles are eligible to buy a BTO flat from HDB and will, similarly, be able to buy a resale PLH flat in future.",4,1071,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01071
2022-01-10-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The PLH model is very new. We will continue to review it over time to ensure it meets the needs of different population segments.,5,1072,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01072
2022-01-10-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While our public housing policies support the marriage and parenthood aspirations of Singaporeans, we also recognise the housing needs and aspirations of singles who wish to have a place of their own. We have expanded the range of housing options available to singles over the years. Today, single Singapore Citizens aged 35 and above can buy resale flats of any size and in any location, including those in existing HDB estates within prime locations that are not launched under the PLH model. To put this in context, a large majority of the resale housing stock, or over a million flats, will be available for singles to purchase in about 15 years at the same time that the first batch of PLH flats reach the open market. First-timer singles also have the option of buying a new 2-room flexi flat from HDB in the non-mature estates. Eligible first-timer singles can also qualify for the various housing grants to assist them in their flat purchase.",6,1073,2022-01-10-T-023-S-01073

While MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) do not mandate or monitor the leave policies across SSAs, SSAs, generally, offer compassionate leave as part of their staff benefits. At the same time, NCSS promulgates best practices related to compensation and staff welfare, as well as offer experts as mentors to human resource practitioners in SSAs.",2,1076,2022-01-10-T-024-S-01076
2022-01-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We recognise that the nature of work in the social service sector can take its toll and social service professionals may encounter particularly stressful events in the course of their work. To safeguard their mental well-being and give them an opportunity to recharge, MSF and NCSS have put in place several initiatives, including the National Care Hotline (NCH) and Sabbatical Leave Scheme (SLS). The NCH provides emotional and psychological support to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including professionals working in social services. The SLS is available to individuals with at least five years of direct work experience in their respective professional fields. It offers up to 10 weeks of paid leave so that they can recharge themselves, and a Professional Advancement Sponsorship to refresh their professional competencies.",3,1077,2022-01-10-T-024-S-01077

We have conferred with social work leaders on balancing staff well-being with maintaining service delivery standards, particularly during this period of high workload and uncertainty brought on by the pandemic. SSAs are mindful of the need to support their employees’ mental well-being and have undertaken various initiatives. For example, during the start of the circuit breaker, AWWA established a care team of social workers and psychologists, for their staff to dial in to and seek support from. The Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) also conducted mindfulness and counselling programmes for their employees, to provide advice, resources and training to improve their mental well-being.",4,1078,2022-01-10-T-024-S-01078

NCSS also offers a range of schemes and initiatives that SSAs can tap on to strengthen their human resource practices and capabilities. These include the People Practice Consultancy (PPC), Organisation Development Journey (ODJ) and the Transformation Support Scheme (TSS). Apart from these schemes, SSAs can tap on various other grants under the VWOs-Charities Capability Fund (VCF). The Community Capability Trust (CCT) will open for applications from April 2022 and will build upon our existing efforts to further support SSAs to achieve organisational excellence.",5,1079,2022-01-10-T-024-S-01079

The scheme provides co-funding of up to 90% (capped at $2,000 per SSA) for SSAs to offer professional counselling services to their staff.

2022-01-10-T-038,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry does not impose a hard cap on the number of working hours and number of call-backs or enforce mandatory taking of annual leave.

2022-01-10-T-038,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To strike a balance between maintaining sufficient manpower reserves for COVID-19 work and allowing staff to take time off, public healthcare clusters are encouraged to allow staff to rest and recharge by taking days off whenever possible. About two thirds of staff in our public healthcare institutions were able to clear their annual leave. Only less than one-third could not fully clear their accumulated leave in 2021. When there is a need to manage workload during surges, clusters have hired additional manpower and reduced non-urgent and non-life-threatening care treatments. MOH has also worked on measures, such as redeploying swabbers, who have been freed up after the change in testing protocols to public healthcare institutions, calling for more volunteers to join the SG Healthcare Corps and tapping on the private healthcare sector.",5,1153,2022-01-10-T-038-S-01153

The cases increased from about 1,080 in 2018, to 1,200 in 2019, and 1,300 in 2020. As of end November 2021, there have been about 1,400 abuse and harassment cases reported. Over the same period, the number of cases of abuse or harassment of public healthcare workers while on duty that were reported to the Police, under section 6 of the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA), has also similarly risen from 40 in 2018 to 68 in 2021.",1,1155,2022-01-10-T-039-S-01155
2022-01-10-T-039,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Possible reasons for the rising trend could be the increase in number of patients seen in the PHIs, coupled with rising expectations from patients and their family members for high quality care and service from healthcare staff. COVID-19 safety precautions, such as hospital visitation limits, may also have resulted in heightened frustration for a handful of patients’ families.",2,1156,2022-01-10-T-039-S-01156
2022-01-10-T-039,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Staff are equipped with preventive and mitigation strategies to manage abuse and harassment. These include recognising high-risk situations and exercising care to maintain good communication with patients and their family members to reduce the risk of interactions escalating to abuse and harassment. Prominent signages are displayed at various touchpoints to remind patients and their family members about the culture of mutual respect in the hospitals. PHIs have established escalation processes for frontline healthcare staff who face abuse and harassment. These include notifying their immediate superiors, referring these cases to security officers on-site or reporting the incident to the Police, if warranted. MOH and PHIs adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards abuse and harassment of healthcare staff and will take action against persons who abuse and harass our staff.

2022-01-10-T-043,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the past three years, HDB has not enforced Special Covenants 2(1) and 2(2) of the Memorandum of Lease. Enforcing the Covenants in the Memorandum of Lease entails compulsory acquisition of the flat, and HDB exercises this right only as a last resort as this is a harsh measure that is not undertaken lightly. HDB’s approach is, therefore, to contemplate enforcement of the Special Covenants in instances where the breaches are serious, for example, for unauthorised renovations where there is a safety risk to residents of the block.",2,1176,2022-01-10-T-043-S-01176

For instance, before GRLs join the grassroots organisations and are appointed to leadership positions, they will serve as observers for a period of time and are given a direct and hands-on assessment on their suitability for appointment into the GROs as full-fledged GRLs.

2022-01-10-T-067,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the implementation of tudung wearing at work among healthcare workers; and (b) how has the response been from the healthcare workers after the implementation.,1,1273,2022-01-10-T-067-S-01273
2022-01-10-T-067,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Since 1 November 2021, female Muslim public healthcare staff, if they wish to do so, can wear the tudung as an add-on to their uniforms. After two months, and as of end December 2021, about 20% of female Muslim uniformed staff have begun wearing the tudung. Some staff have chosen not to do so, while some others may be considering. We respect the decision of each individual.",1,1274,2022-01-10-T-067-S-01274
2022-01-10-T-067,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hospitals have put in place clinical guidelines and communicated them to staff, to ensure adherence to the infection control requirements for the safety of patients and staff. Staff who choose to wear the tudung have also undergone refitting for N95 masks. Thus far, feedback from both Muslim and non-Muslim staff has been generally positive, with Muslim staff expressing appreciation for this change, and patients respecting the wishes of the nurses. Some staff have also received compliments from patients on their neat and professional attire with their tudung.",2,1275,2022-01-10-T-067-S-01275
2022-01-10-T-068,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for National Development in the past five years, what has been the increase in resale HDB prices per square foot, excluding resale of flats under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme.",1,1276,2022-01-10-T-068-S-01276
2022-01-10-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Based on resale flat transactions registered from January 2017 to September 2021, excluding those sold under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme, the median HDB resale flat price, on a per square metre basis, decreased by about 2% from 2017 to 2019, and increased by about 16% from 2019 to 2021. Over the past five years, this represented an increase of about 14%. The median HDB resale flat price per square metre was $4,260 in 2017; $4,189 in 2018; $4,172 in 2019; $4,345 in 2020 and $4,839 in 2021.",1,1277,2022-01-10-T-068-S-01277
2022-01-10-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The recent increase in resale prices can be attributed to a broad-based increase in demand for housing, supported by the current low interest rate environment. On 15 December 2021, the Government announced a set of measures to cool the private residential and HDB resale markets and will continue to monitor the housing market conditions closely to ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable public housing.",2,1278,2022-01-10-T-068-S-01278

2022-01-10-T-070,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOH adopts a multi-pronged approach to dementia care. This includes raising awareness of dementia, expanding care capacity and capabilities in the community and hospitals and supporting caregivers of persons living with dementia.",1,1282,2022-01-10-T-070-S-01282
2022-01-10-T-070,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First of all, to support persons living with dementia and their caregivers after the initial diagnosis, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) have set up community outreach teams and community intervention teams. They conduct public outreach and education to raise awareness of dementia and conduct interventions to provide timely support. We have also rolled out 14 Dementia-Friendly Communities to create a conducive environment for persons living with dementia and their caregivers to live well in the community. This is achieved by raising dementia awareness and providing more dementia-friendly services, among other measures.",2,1283,2022-01-10-T-070-S-01283
2022-01-10-T-070,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Next, to increase the accessibility of care services, MOH has set up dementia clinics in polyclinics so that persons living with dementia can receive medical care near their homes. We have also increased the number of Dementia Day Care places, over a five-year period, between 2015 and 2020.",3,1284,2022-01-10-T-070-S-01284
2022-01-10-T-070,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Lastly, we provide caregivers of persons living with dementia with respite care options through senior centres and nursing homes. For instance, the Night Respite pilot offers overnight respite for caregivers of persons living with dementia with behavioural and sleep issues. Families also receive financial support to defray long-term care costs. This includes subsidies for medical care and eldercare services, disability grants and insurance schemes. MOH will continue to review the dementia support required for our ageing population.",4,1285,2022-01-10-T-070-S-01285

2022-01-10-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"There has been a rising number of such scams and frauds. Most recently, many customers of one of our local banks were tricked into divulging their Internet banking credentials to scammers, who were then able to siphon funds out of the customers’ bank accounts. The banks have been issuing repeated warnings on their digital platforms about such scams, but the scams have become more sophisticated and more bank customers have fallen prey.",2,1288,2022-01-10-T-071-S-01288

One key area of progress has been the strengthening of funds recovery for victims of such scams. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) works with banks in Singapore to freeze, within one day, domestic bank accounts receiving scam monies.",3,1289,2022-01-10-T-071-S-01289
2022-01-10-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"As was implied in the question from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, the freezing of overseas accounts is more challenging as it involves agencies in different jurisdictions. But, of late, there has been some progress in this area. For example, between June and December 2021, through strong information-sharing and collaboration by SPF and its international law enforcement counterparts, 16 transnational syndicates perpetrating job scams, Internet love scams and impersonation scams were busted by the Royal Malaysian Police and the Hong Kong Police Force. I understand that MHA will be providing more information on the efforts by the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams and on SPF’s initiatives, in response to the Parliamentary Question by Mr Christopher de Souza scheduled for the 11 January Sitting.",4,1290,2022-01-10-T-071-S-01290
2022-01-10-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Notwithstanding progress on these fronts, we are deeply concerned with the recent uptrend in online scams and the financial losses suffered by unsuspecting customers. MAS is working with banks and payment institutions to explore additional measures to mitigate the risk of scams, without impairing the speed and convenience of payments that customers expect and would want for legitimate transactions. A cooling-off period is among the measures we have been considering, to see if it could be a practical way to avoid certain types of scams.",5,1291,2022-01-10-T-071-S-01291
2022-01-10-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"We are also exploring other measures even further upstream in the chain of transactions, including lowering default transaction limits and notification thresholds, and enhancing fraud surveillance systems to detect and block anomalous transfers more promptly. There will also be a public consultation on the recommended measures, to provide clarity on the responsibilities of financial institutions and consumers to protect e-payments, as well as liability apportionment principles in the event of fraudulent transactions.",6,1292,2022-01-10-T-071-S-01292
2022-01-10-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),The tactics employed by scammers will continue to grow in sophistication. Each of us has to exercise utmost caution when transacting online. Never pursue online deals that appear too good to be true. Never click on unverified links. Never divulge your Internet banking credentials or passwords to anyone. Closely monitor transaction notifications so that any unauthorised payments are reported early enough to increase the chances of recovery. We can address the scourge of scams if all of us are on guard and play our part.,7,1293,2022-01-10-T-071-S-01293

2022-01-10-T-072,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is currently working with researchers from the Nanyang Technological University to carry out exploratory studies on Singapore’s geothermal potential. The research team plans to drill two boreholes, which are similar to the boreholes drilled for soil investigation works for construction activities, and conduct subsurface surveys",1,1296,2022-01-10-T-072-S-01296
2022-01-10-T-072,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The research team is in the process of seeking the necessary approvals. As part of the process, the research team will undergo an in-depth consultation with technical agencies to determine if environmental studies or mitigating measures are needed.",2,1297,2022-01-10-T-072-S-01297
2022-01-10-T-072,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"If the exploratory studies yield promising results, EMA may conduct further studies to determine the viability of deploying geothermal systems in Singapore. Such studies will likewise undergo in-depth consultations with the relevant technical agencies, as required. If found to be feasible, geothermal energy could serve as an additional source of indigenous clean energy, besides solar, and support Singapore in meeting our climate change goals.",3,1298,2022-01-10-T-072-S-01298
2022-01-10-T-073,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health whether the protocol that disregards active polymerase chain reaction test results for recovered COVID-19 individuals, as long as their cycle threshold (CT) values are sufficiently high, is also applied to newly-detected (and especially asymptomatic) cases which may be at the beginning or tail end of their infection.",1,1299,2022-01-10-T-073-S-01299
2022-01-10-T-073,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The cycle threshold (CT) value indicates the viral load of the patient being tested. However, unlike internal body scans or blood tests which are clinical tests with reported results, a CT value is technical laboratory parameter, with calibrated cut-offs for positive results, that is not routinely reported to patients.",1,1300,2022-01-10-T-073-S-01300
2022-01-10-T-073,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Doctors can disclose the CT value and discuss its clinical significance with patients. In most situations, the CT values do not affect the clinical management of a COVID-19-positive case. The risk profile and severity of symptoms of the patient are more important.",2,1301,2022-01-10-T-073-S-01301
2022-01-10-T-073,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A recovered patient and a newly-infected person may both test positive and register high CT values, that is, low viral load, but the interpretation is entirely different and needs to take into account the clinical context. For a recovered patient, it is most likely that he is still shedding small amounts of dead viral fragments. For a newly-infected person, it is most likely that his infection has been detected early and the viral load is likely to increase in a few days, when he will become more infectious. Hence, the clinical management in these two scenarios cannot be similar just because the patients register a similar CT value.",3,1302,2022-01-10-T-073-S-01302

The increase is largely attributed to an increase in reports of fraudulent health insurance claims – these increased from five reports in 2018 to 32 reports in 2020.

2022-01-10-T-082,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MTI does not track the number of commercial malls in Singapore that provide designated drop-off and pick-up points or designated parking lots for delivery riders. Increasingly, more malls see value in facilitating the work of delivery riders. This includes implementing designated pick-up points to facilitate deliveries and setting up dedicated mall entry queues for delivery riders for Safe Entry and vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) checks. Some malls also extended the grace periods for parked vehicles during the Heightened Alert phases to allow delivery riders to park temporarily while collecting orders.",1,1341,2022-01-10-T-082-S-01341

2022-01-10-T-086,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Bloomberg New Economy Forum 2021 was an important event for Singapore as it brought together over 300 leading global CEOs, current and former Government leaders, and thought leaders and experts to discuss solutions to address pertinent global issues in finance, trade, climate change, cities and health. The Forum affirmed Singapore’s status as a leading business hub and supported the business development efforts of Singapore companies that participated in it.",1,1352,2022-01-10-T-086-S-01352
2022-01-10-T-086,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Forum also benefited our tourism sector, which has been hard-hit by COVID-19. It generated around S$1.2 million of tourism receipts across four days and was widely covered by local and international media. As one of the first physical global Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) events held in Singapore amidst COVID-19, it successfully piloted COVID-19 safe approaches for MICE events. More importantly, the event demonstrated Singapore’s capability in conducting large-scale international MICE events safely despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. This benefits Singapore’s competitiveness as a leading MICE destination and paves the way for Singapore to host other globally significant MICE events.",2,1353,2022-01-10-T-086-S-01353

2022-01-10-T-088,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on how the COVID-19 Omicron variant is impacting Vaccinated Travel Lanes.,1,1359,2022-01-10-T-088-S-01359
2022-01-10-T-088,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We started the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) scheme in September 2021 and, by end November, had progressively expanded the scheme to 27 countries. On 26 November 2021, the World Health Organization designated the Omicron variant as a Variant of Concern. In response, we halted the expansion of the VTL scheme to more countries and deferred the launch of the VTL scheme to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a precautionary move. We also decided to maintain the daily quota of VTL (Air) travellers at 10,000 rather than increase it to 15,000 as we had earlier intended.",1,1360,2022-01-10-T-088-S-01360
2022-01-10-T-088,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On 22 December 2021, given the rapid and global spread of the Omicron variant, we froze the sale of new VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore from 23 December 2021 to 20 January 2022. We have also imposed a 50% limit on the daily number of VTL travellers from 21 January 2022. These were calibrated moves that balanced the need to manage the risk of imported Omicron cases while minimising disruption to travellers who had already made VTL bookings to enter Singapore.",2,1361,2022-01-10-T-088-S-01361
2022-01-10-T-088,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In addition, we tightened the testing regime for VTL travellers. Besides the pre-departure and on-arrival COVID-19 tests, VTL travellers are required to undergo daily self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs) on Days 2 to 7 of their arrival in Singapore, and those who test positive are required to undergo a confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. Whilst these enhanced measures may have caused some inconvenience for travellers, they were necessary to give us valuable time to study and understand the Omicron variant and to strengthen our defences, including enhancing our healthcare capacity and getting more people vaccinated and boosted.",3,1362,2022-01-10-T-088-S-01362
2022-01-10-T-088,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"International evidence indicates that the Omicron variant, while more transmissible, is less severe, and vaccination, especially with boosting, continues to provide good protection from severe illness. For now, MOH’s assessment is that the enhanced testing regime and limits on the number of VTL arrivals are sufficient to manage the public health risk. We will continue to work closely with MOH to regularly review our border measures and protocols.",4,1363,2022-01-10-T-088-S-01363
2022-01-10-T-089,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how effective have pre-arrival polymerase chain reaction tests been at detecting COVID-19 infections before an incoming traveller under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) enters the community; (b) whether there have been any cases of VTL travellers failing to comply with the enhanced testing regime; and (c) whether reinstatement of Stay-Home Notice or Quarantine Order will be considered should the number of COVID-19 Omicron cases escalate.,1,1364,2022-01-10-T-089-S-01364
2022-01-10-T-089,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"All travellers who enter Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) undergo an on-arrival test (OAT) and are required to self-isolate until they produce a negative OAT result. OAT has been effective in identifying COVID-19-positive individuals and isolating them before they interact with the community. As of 31 December 2021, more than 220,000 VTL-Air and VTL-Land travellers had entered Singapore, of whom less than 1% were found to be COVID-19-positive based on their OAT results and were isolated according to the prevailing public health protocols.",1,1365,2022-01-10-T-089-S-01365
2022-01-10-T-089,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"With the emergence of Omicron, the testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs has been enhanced to reduce the risk of spread of Omicron in Singapore. From 7 December 2021, arriving VTL travellers have been required to perform daily self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs) on Days 2 to 7 of their arrival in Singapore. Travellers are required to upload their test results on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6. On Days 3 and 7, they undergo supervised self-administered ARTs at Combined Test Centres or Quick Test Centres and the results are automatically uploaded to MOH’s database. Those who test positive are contacted to undergo a confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.",2,1366,2022-01-10-T-089-S-01366
2022-01-10-T-089,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Travellers who do not submit their test results or attend their supervised tests are contacted and reminded to do so. The overall compliance rate for the VTL testing regime has been about 99%.,3,1367,2022-01-10-T-089-S-01367
2022-01-10-T-089,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,MOH’s current assessment is that the enhanced testing regime and limits on the number of VTL arrivals are sufficient to manage the public health risk and there is no need to reintroduce Stay-Home Notice for VTL travellers.,4,1368,2022-01-10-T-089-S-01368
2022-01-10-T-090,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Transport how has the replacement of discretionary right turns with Red Amber Green (RAG) signals improved road and pedestrian safety at the respective traffic junctions where these new signals have been deployed.,1,1369,2022-01-10-T-090-S-01369
2022-01-10-T-090,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Discretionary right turns help to optimise traffic flow as motorists are able to execute the turn when there is no conflicting pedestrian or vehicular traffic. This is particularly useful at junctions with low traffic. However, for junctions where there is a higher risk of accidents, LTA has been progressively introducing Red Amber Green (RAG) signals. Such junctions that have been installed with RAG signals have seen a decrease of about 40% in accidents involving right turns.",1,1370,2022-01-10-T-090-S-01370
2022-01-10-T-090,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Besides RAG signals, LTA also enhances junction safety through other initiatives, such as appropriate road markings, lighted road studs, integrated pedestrian countdown timers and signs.",2,1371,2022-01-10-T-090-S-01371
2022-01-10-T-091,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many serious accidents involving cyclists happened on roads and park connectors in the last five years from 2017 to 2021; and (b) whether regulations on speed limit and safety standards have helped to improve the safety of biking.,1,1372,2022-01-10-T-091-S-01372
2022-01-10-T-091,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"From 2017 to 2021, there was an average of about 560 serious accidents each year involving cyclists on roads, and about 90 serious accidents each year on shared paths, that is, cycling paths in towns and park connectors island-wide.",1,1373,2022-01-10-T-091-S-01373
2022-01-10-T-091,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Over the years, LTA has introduced various regulations to promote the safe use of bicycles and power-assisted bicycles on roads and paths. These include speed limits of 25 kilometres per hour on cycling paths and 10 kilometres per hour on footpaths, which were last revised in 2018. It is difficult to assess the direct impact of each regulation on safety outcomes. But, taken holistically, together with regular education campaigns and enforcement efforts, the number of serious accidents per year has remained relatively stable, notwithstanding the increasing popularity of cycling in recent years. LTA will continue to step up education and enforcement efforts, to strengthen knowledge of and compliance with safe cycling practices. At the same time, we urge all road and path users to continue to play their part to use our shared spaces in a responsible manner.",2,1374,2022-01-10-T-091-S-01374

2022-01-10-T-095,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have plans to deploy 60,000 charging points by 2030, of which 40,000 will be at public carparks and 20,000 at private premises. To do this, we will progressively deploy EV charging points in HDB carparks based on available electrical capacity and upgrade electrical infrastructure where necessary. We assess that this will be adequate to meet expected EV charging demand in aggregate based on the projected EV population, since a typical electric car user will only require a full charge roughly once a week. That said, we recognise that there may be some parking locations with strong charging demand. We will work with EV charging operators to develop solutions for such locations. We will also review and update our charging point deployment plans based on actual adoption rates.",2,1386,2022-01-10-T-095-S-01386

2022-01-10-T-096,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"COVID-19 has brought to the fore the importance of building further resilience in our supply chains. During the two-week temporary closure of JFP in July 2021, SFA and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) responded quickly to facilitate distributors and supermarkets to activate alternative arrangements.

For example, hockey can be modified and played as a four-a-side competition instead of the usual eleven-a-side game. The modifications will provide student athletes with good development opportunities and competition experience while ensuring their safety and well-being.

In these visits, monitoring and/or retesting would be done to ensure that patients are no longer infectious. If other types of post-COVID-19 care is required, patients will continue to have access to the regular healthcare financing coverage, such as Government subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave where applicable, to help pay for their bills.

2022-01-10-T-122,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model is designed with the objective of keeping public housing in prime locations affordable and inclusive for Singaporeans.,1,1487,2022-01-10-T-122-S-01487
2022-01-10-T-122,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To keep PLH flat prices affordable for a wide range of Singaporeans, new PLH flats will be priced with additional subsidies, on top of the substantial subsidies already provided for BTO flats. Beyond the initial purchase, we also want to ensure that the prices of these flats remain within reach of Singaporeans when the PLH flats are sold subsequently on the open market.",2,1488,2022-01-10-T-122-S-01488
2022-01-10-T-122,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Without policy intervention, resale prices for PLH flats would likely increase beyond the reach of many Singaporeans. We will, therefore, require buyers of a PLH flat on the resale market to meet the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria, to ensure affordability and accessibility over a longer period of time while managing the demand for the limited supply of PLH flats. Singaporeans are familiar with the means-tested conditions in our BTO eligibility criteria which cover a broad range of Singaporean households. Today, more than eight in 10 Singaporeans are eligible to buy a subsidised flat.",3,1489,2022-01-10-T-122-S-01489
2022-01-10-T-122,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As the PLH model is a new model restricted to prime areas, there will not be many flats launched under this model in the initial phase and, therefore, it is necessary at present to set guidelines for priority. Applying the BTO eligibility criteria gives priority to Singaporean families, who may need more space because they have bigger households. This includes singles who can form a family unit with their parent(s), or single sibling(s) whose parents have passed on. These singles are eligible to buy a BTO flat from HDB and will, similarly, be able to buy a resale PLH flat in future.",4,1490,2022-01-10-T-122-S-01490

2022-01-10-T-122,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While our public housing policies support the marriage and parenthood aspirations of Singaporeans, we also recognise the housing needs and aspirations of singles who wish to have a place of their own. We have expanded the range of housing options available to singles over the years. Today, single Singapore Citizens aged 35 and above can buy resale flats of any size and in any location, including those in existing HDB estates within prime locations that are not launched under the PLH model. To put this in context, a large majority of the resale housing stock, or over a million flats, will be available for singles to purchase in about 15 years at the same time that the first batch of PLH flats reach the open market. First-timer singles also have the option of buying a new 2-room Flexi flat from HDB in the non-mature estates.

These complaints were isolated cases involving two gymnasium units. HDB has since engaged the gymnasiums to take active measures to address the noise nuisance, such as adjusting hours of operations and putting in place systems to monitor the noise level, and no further complaints have been received thus far. If HDB receives persistent feedback on nuisance from gymnasiums, HDB may revoke the approval for gymnasium operations.

To derive the selling prices, HDB then applies a significant subsidy to the assessed market values to ensure that new flats are affordable to those buying their first home. In addition, eligible first-timer flat buyers can also enjoy the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) of up to $80,000, which provides further support to lower- and middle-income families buying their first home. For resale flats, the Government provides housing grants of up to $160,000 to ensure resale flats remain affordable for eligible first-timer families.",1,1509,2022-01-10-T-127-S-01509

Over the past three years, the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR), which is the proportion of monthly income used to service mortgage instalment payments, has remained at about 23% or below for both new and resale flat buyers taking an HDB housing loan, on average. This means that buyers, generally, require little or no cash outlay in servicing the payments for their flats as their mortgage loans can be paid using their CPF contributions.",2,1510,2022-01-10-T-127-S-01510

Looking ahead, HDB is prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, if needed, subject to prevailing demand.

Within one month of the launch of the scheme, more than three-quarters of the 1.3 million Singaporean households have successfully claimed their vouchers and over $28 million worth of vouchers have been spent. This speedy response was also possible because of the use of the digital platform for claims and spending.
