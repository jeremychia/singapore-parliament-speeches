2022-02-14-T-002-S-00023,2022-02-14-T-002,23,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether MAS will consider introducing a legally-binding risk-based approach framework in tackling the security of digital banking as has been done in Notice 626 which deals with Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism; and (b) whether MAS will consider implementing a customer risk profile assessment, based on objective assessment, to determine the level of controls that financial institutions maintain over a customer's account."

2022-02-14-T-002-S-00031,2022-02-14-T-002,31,Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the challenges posed to our efforts to educate Singaporeans and, in particular, our seniors on anti-scam precautions and measures; and (b) how does the Ministry intend to enhance its outreach to further strengthen digital resilience among Singaporeans."
2022-02-14-T-002-S-00032,2022-02-14-T-002,32,Shahira Abdullah,"asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider adopting for the health sector some of the cybersecurity measures recently announced by MAS and the Association of Banks in Singapore, such as removing clickable links in emails or SMSes, given the sensitivity of health data, the prevalence of scams and the vulnerability among some segments of the community to fall prey to such scams."
2022-02-14-T-002-S-00033,2022-02-14-T-002,33,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past five years, what is the number of scam-related crime; (b) whether the Ministry has plans to devote more resources to investigate scam-related crime; and (c) how is SPF working with banks and other agencies to reduce scam-related crime in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-002-S-00034,2022-02-14-T-002,34,Tan Wu Meng,Question No 7.
2022-02-14-T-002-S-00035,2022-02-14-T-002,35,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to answer Oral Question Nos 7 to 32 as part of the three Ministerial Statements to be delivered by the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Mrs Josephine Teo, the Minister of State for Home Affairs Mr Desmond Tan and myself, at tomorrow's Sitting."
2022-02-14-T-002-S-00036,2022-02-14-T-002,36,Speaker,"Yes, you may."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00037,2022-02-14-T-003,37,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he can provide an update on the internal investigations conducted against the Police officers involved in the case of
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00038,2022-02-14-T-003,38,K Shanmugam,"I thank the Member for the question. In respect of the case, the Police's Internal Affairs Office (IAO) has completed its internal investigations relating to the Police Investigation Officer (IO) and his supervisor."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00039,2022-02-14-T-003,39,K Shanmugam,"Generally, the IAO will take this approach  one, look at the facts of the case, the actions of the officers involved, how they have handled any lapses; two, listen to the explanations given by the officers; and three, assess and recommend the disciplinary action, if any, to be taken."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00040,2022-02-14-T-003,40,K Shanmugam,"When the IAO started its investigations against the two officers, I made clear the following two points, which I have made in the past in the House as well as outside."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00041,2022-02-14-T-003,41,K Shanmugam,"First, our approach must always be to do our duty, conduct investigations without fear or favour."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00042,2022-02-14-T-003,42,K Shanmugam,"Second, at the same time, we do not look to scapegoat or act unfairly. We do not go out to blame and punish, just because there has been a lot of public interest in the matter and because some call for heavy punishment. We must deal with this case as we would deal with any other case, regardless of publicity. We must deal with it professionally and properly."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00043,2022-02-14-T-003,43,K Shanmugam,This is important for the public and the Police to know. Police officers have to often exercise their judgement and discretion in the course of their duties – sometimes on an urgent basis but always under some sort of pressure.
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00044,2022-02-14-T-003,44,K Shanmugam,"We want our Police officers to be confident in exercising their discretion, when they are performing their duties. We cannot fault officers, just because we think, with the benefit of hindsight, that we would have exercised our discretion differently in their situation or just because we do not agree with their judgement or exercise of discretion. And the officers must know that action will be taken against them, only if there are discipline issues or misconduct, or some breach. The management culture, all the way from the top, must be that we ask that the matter be dealt with fairly, be prepared to explain in public what action is fair and why."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00045,2022-02-14-T-003,45,K Shanmugam,"The investigations in this case found that both the IO and his supervisor had neglected their duties. Neglect of duty means the failure to take proper action to perform a required task. The penalty for neglect of duty depends on the officers' degree of culpability and the harm caused by their actions. Penalties can range from a reprimand, or financial penalty, to demotion and dismissal from service. The maximum financial penalty imposed under the Public Service Commission (Delegation of Disciplinary Functions) Directions is a fine equivalent to the stoppage of increment for two years. There are, of course, other more severe penalties possible, under legislation, and that really depends on the conduct."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00046,2022-02-14-T-003,46,K Shanmugam,The IO who handled the Police report handled it as a routine theft case; and it was so. But there were some lapses. The lapses include the following.
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00047,2022-02-14-T-003,47,K Shanmugam,"First, the IO did not visit the scene of crime promptly to carry out investigation and gather evidence. This contributed to a break in the chain of custody for some exhibits."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00048,2022-02-14-T-003,48,K Shanmugam,"Second, the IO did not properly verify some of the claims made by the parties during the investigation."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00049,2022-02-14-T-003,49,K Shanmugam,"Third, his supervisor did not provide sufficient guidance, which contributed to the lapses."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00050,2022-02-14-T-003,50,K Shanmugam,"The IAO also took into account the intense pressure that the IO was working under. He was handling many ongoing investigations, prosecutions and conducting arrest operations at the same time. I have spoken before about the workload challenges that Police IOs face. The only way to deal with this is to increase Police's headcount. We have not solved that issue yet. It is a difficult problem and not easily solvable because of the general manpower shortage."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00051,2022-02-14-T-003,51,K Shanmugam,"In the event, a financial penalty, equivalent to the medium range, was imposed on both officers for neglect of duty. The Public Service Commission, as the authority for disciplinary control of civil servants, has concurred with the penalty imposed on both officers."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00052,2022-02-14-T-003,52,K Shanmugam,"As I said, the two Police officers were doing their jobs under difficult circumstances and, up until this incident, they have discharged their duties dutifully. I have sympathy for the situation that they find themselves in. But they have fallen short of expectations and they have been dealt with in the way other officers would have been dealt with in similar circumstances."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00053,2022-02-14-T-003,53,Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00054,2022-02-14-T-003,54,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I thank the Minister for the clarification and the answer. I am heartened to see that we are putting our officers at the heart, front and centre of the things that we do, even during investigations. Our officers are all human beings. They face pressures of family, professionally and personally as well. I am heartened that there is some form of review on the workload distribution and the manpower challenges."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00055,2022-02-14-T-003,55,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In this regard, may I ask if there are any avenues for our officers to escalate the pressures of the workload or the stressors that they are facing, both at work and elsewhere, within the institution of the Police organisation and the investigation body? So, whether or not there could be a bit more support in terms of counselling, mentorship, perhaps? I note that the supervisor in this case has been found to have lapsed in his supervision, but could there have been other channels of oversight or avenues for the officer to escalate those stressors and the pressures that he may face?"
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00056,2022-02-14-T-003,56,K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir, I will make two points in response. First, we put the officers at the heart of what we do because there is something even more central and fundamental – which is public interest. The officers are there to serve public interest and if public interest is affected in some way, we have to take action. But the institution can only do well if the officers are treated fairly. The officers have to be treated fairly so that they can do their job and so that public interest – which is the fundamental, primary, central goal – is achieved."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00057,2022-02-14-T-003,57,K Shanmugam,"So, it is not putting officers above the public but serving the public through making sure that there is a strong institution. And in order for there to be a strong institution, there have got to be good officers who know that they will be treated fairly. So, that is the approach."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00058,2022-02-14-T-003,58,K Shanmugam,"On the second point, how do we take care of the officers, there are many avenues. In every context, there are officers' senior officers who are tasked to take feedback, collect, understand and, in fact, part of leadership, that has to be emphasised – not just in SPF, but in other places, too – is to make sure that the morale of your officers remains high. Surveys – both internal as well as independent – show that the morale of Police officers is high. And public confidence in the Police force, despite some scurrilous attempts by some third parties to continuously run down the Police, remains extremely high. Contrary to the way people perceive police forces in many other parts of the world, the Singapore Police officer is held in very high esteem, very high regard. And we have to continue with that."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00059,2022-02-14-T-003,59,K Shanmugam,"As to whether we can do more, I have explained the difficulties. The fundamental difficulty is that there are not enough officers. There is only so much more that you can do when your central problem is that there is more work than can reasonably be done by the workforce we have. And I have said we do our best in those circumstances."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00060,2022-02-14-T-003,60,Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00061,2022-02-14-T-003,61,Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister on what he just told the House. First, he mentioned that the punishment that was recommended for the two officers, meaning the IO and his supervisor, was a fine which was equivalent to a stoppage of pay, or something along those lines. So, I would like to ask him whether he means that the officers concerned will not receive their pay for a few months. That is the first question."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00062,2022-02-14-T-003,62,Sylvia Lim,"The second question is, were the IO and the supervisor punished similarly? In other words, was one assigned more responsibility than the other and will one have stoppage of more months of pay compared to the other?"
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00063,2022-02-14-T-003,63,K Shanmugam,"I thank the Member for that question. In context, what happened is that a fine was imposed on them, plus, in addition, a number of months of increment are forgone. So, there were actually two penalties imposed on them. The number of months differs for the two officers but, as I have said, it is at the mid-point of what could have been imposed."
2022-02-14-T-003-S-00064,2022-02-14-T-003,64,K Shanmugam,"And how were the two officers approached? On the respective roles that they played. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Minister for Home Affairs"", Official Report, 14 February 2022, Vol 95, Issue No 47, Clarification section.]"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00065,2022-02-14-T-004,65,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked the Minister for Education in view of the recent death of the twins in Upper Bukit Timah, what lessons can be learnt on the protection of children with special needs and the guidance and support for caregivers, at the national, community and family levels."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00066,2022-02-14-T-004,66,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Education (a) how many students are there currently in mainstream schools who have been diagnosed as requiring extra learning support or having special needs; and (b) what additional support has been mandated and available to these students and their families.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00067,2022-02-14-T-004,67,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Education (a) in the last three years, whether there is an increase in the number of persons with disability, particularly among the student population; and (b) whether the Ministry has plans to improve the support for caregivers of persons with disability."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00068,2022-02-14-T-004,68,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will strengthen its support for (i) parents and caregivers of children with special needs and (ii) ageing parents who are caring for their grown-up children with special needs.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00069,2022-02-14-T-004,69,Shahira Abdullah,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what further steps can be taken to ensure that the mental health of caregivers of special needs individuals, children and the elderly are sufficiently supported and that such caregivers will know where to turn to for help."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00070,2022-02-14-T-004,70,Don Wee,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what measures are in place to reach out to caregivers and promote assistance programmes like respite care through social service agencies; and (b) whether there are interim caregiving services available for highly-stressed families.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00071,2022-02-14-T-004,71,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to have the next six questions to be taken together by Minister Masagos and myself, please?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00072,2022-02-14-T-004,72,Speaker,"So, that is Question Nos 34 to 39? Yes, please."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00073,2022-02-14-T-004,73,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, we are all deeply saddened to learn of the deaths of 11-year-old twin brothers Ethan Yap and Aston Yap on 21 January. My MOE colleagues and I mourn their passing and we extend our condolences to their families, friends and schoolmates. I believe all Members of this House will agree with us that the pain hits especially hard, because such young lives have been lost."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00074,2022-02-14-T-004,74,Chan Chun Sing,"Soon after the twins' deaths were made public, the media reported that the boys had special needs. Today, I will not touch on the specifics of this case as it is before the Court, and I urge members of the public not to speculate on the incident or to prematurely draw conclusions on what should be done. But, today, together with Minister for Social and Family Development Minister Masagos, I will address how the Government and all of us can take a whole-of-community approach to provide targeted support to children with special needs and their caregivers across different life stages."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00075,2022-02-14-T-004,75,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, it is our goal for children with special needs to reach their full potential, to be confident in themselves and to be equipped with life skills and values so that they can grow up to lead, as much as possible, as normal, as independent a life as possible."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00076,2022-02-14-T-004,76,Chan Chun Sing,"This starts from the early years, where early detection and timely intervention are critical. Parents are encouraged to refer to the developmental milestones in the Health Promotion Board's Child Health Booklet as reference points and take their children for regular childhood developmental screenings at general practitioners' clinics or polyclinics. If any delay in the child's development is detected, the child will be referred to paediatricians for further diagnosis of developmental concerns. In the preschool, teachers may also flag up children with suspected developmental delays to early intervention professionals, who will work with paediatricians to determine the children's needs. Those children identified to require early intervention, or EI, will be referred to the appropriate EI programmes based on the level of support needed. Depending on the programme, children may receive EI support within their preschools or at EI centres."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00077,2022-02-14-T-004,77,Chan Chun Sing,"For the schooling years, to help parents decide how to best support their children's special educational needs, MOE has collaborated with hospitals, EI centres and special education, or SPED, schools to develop common standards to guide professional assessments and align the recommendations we give to parents. Based on these assessments and recommendations, parents decide whether to enrol their children in a mainstream Primary school or a SPED school. MOE also holds an annual Parent Forum, in collaboration with KK Women's and Children's Hospital and National University Hospital (NUH), to help parents better understand how mainstream and SPED schools can support their children's needs. Parents of children with special educational needs are invited as speakers to share their experiences in choosing a school and working with the school to support their children."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00078,2022-02-14-T-004,78,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, today, some 27,000 students with mild special educational needs attend mainstream schools, supported by teachers who implement inclusive classroom practices and Allied Educators who specialise in learning and behavioural support. Because of their additional needs, some may need pull-out support during or after curriculum time. Those who need additional support in literacy and numeracy join the Learning Support Programmes in English Language and Mathematics in Primary 1 and 2. And those with Dyslexia may join the School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme for Primary 3 and 4. Last year, we announced that we are rolling out the TRANsition Support for InTegration, or TRANSIT programme, for Primary 1 students with social and behavioural needs. Thirty-seven schools have implemented this programme, and more will be coming on board."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00079,2022-02-14-T-004,79,Chan Chun Sing,"When children have higher support needs, professionals will recommend a SPED school because these schools have specialised instruction and customised facilities, specially-trained teachers and Allied Professionals. Currently, approximately 7,000 students, or about 20% of all students reported with special educational needs, attend the existing 22 SPED schools. These students have moderate to severe special needs. Across mainstream and SPED schools, the number of students reported with special educational needs has risen by about 5% in the last three years, largely due to growing awareness and early identification."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00080,2022-02-14-T-004,80,Chan Chun Sing,"Parents are our key partners as they provide valuable insights into their children's unique needs. This is why schools engage families early to find out their children's needs. Schools then provide details of the support available in school and how the school and parents can work together to support their child. When schools and families communicate, they build relationships and share strategies that can be used both in school and at home."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00081,2022-02-14-T-004,81,Chan Chun Sing,"In some cases, parents of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools may find that the mainstream environment does not suit their child. With the advice of MOE Educational Psychologists and the school's teachers and Allied Educators, they may conclude that their child is better supported in a SPED School. MOE also provides Post-Diagnosis Educational Guidance to render emotional support and assistance to parents in the journey towards acceptance of their child's special needs."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00082,2022-02-14-T-004,82,Chan Chun Sing,"In SPED schools, teachers work closely with parents to exchange information on their children's progress and support the application of skills at home and in the community. Each school has a social worker who can help families with additional emotional or financial needs, if needed. Families can access programmes outside of curriculum hours, such as holiday activities and outings run by the schools or Social Service Agencies (SSAs), in collaboration with external organisations and volunteers. There are also Special Student Care Centres, which provide before-and-after school care services for school-going children with special educational needs. SG Enable as well as SSAs also organise parent and sibling engagement activities, including workshops and camps, where participants provide mutual support by sharing experiences and advice."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00083,2022-02-14-T-004,83,Chan Chun Sing,"To help students and families transit from SPED to post-school life, MOE works with the SPED schools to implement school-wide processes of transition planning for students at the Secondary years, where each student has an Individual Transition Plan reflecting his or her post-school interests, strengths and aspirations. MOE also works with MSF, SG Enable and the SPED schools for the School-to-Work Transition Programme, to support work-capable students in transiting from school to work. For SPED graduates who do not transit to employment due to higher needs, MOE works with SPED schools and SG Enable to facilitate their transition to post-school options based on their abilities and needs, including for students identified for MSF-funded services."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00084,2022-02-14-T-004,84,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, all parents plan on providing for our children in every possible way until they reach independence as adults. So, we can all understand when parents discover that their child will need a lot more support for a lot longer, even into adulthood. We can experience their heartache, shock and even fear. This is an unplanned journey and can be a challenging one. Many of us know of such families, amongst our friends, relatives or in the community. Some of us are ourselves family of a special person."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00085,2022-02-14-T-004,85,Chan Chun Sing,"I am heartened to hear of families which have drawn strength from circles of support and who have, in turn, given support to others, allowing them to cope with the stress and challenges of journeying alongside their special child."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00086,2022-02-14-T-004,86,Chan Chun Sing,"So, let us do our part to serve as a circle of support for these children and their families. We cannot say, ""Let the other neighbour help. Let the other relatives help. Let the other company hire him."" We need not wait for one another – let us all take the first step. Let us all let them know that we value them and their children. Let us remind them that they are not alone. When the parents need a break, let us step in to play with or accompany their children. When they seek an understanding employer or colleague, let us be that understanding employer or colleague. Let us be a community that reaches out in both words and deeds to demonstrate care and kindness. Let us be an inclusive society that uplifts one another, leaves no Singaporean behind and moves forward as one."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00087,2022-02-14-T-004,87,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have Mr Masagos make his reply?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00088,2022-02-14-T-004,88,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00089,2022-02-14-T-004,89,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take Question Nos 37 to 39 together, please?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00090,2022-02-14-T-004,90,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00091,2022-02-14-T-004,91,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Minister Chan spoke about the support available for children with special needs and their caregivers during the schooling years. I will share more on the support available for caregivers of persons with special needs or disabilities beyond the school setting.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00092,2022-02-14-T-004,92,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SG Enable was set up in 2013 to support persons with disabilities and is now the single touchpoint for disability and caregiver support services, as well as public education efforts. Caregivers of persons with disabilities who need information to better care for their loved ones and themselves may access the Enabling Guide at www.enablingguide.sg. This is SG Enable's first-stop resource portal for caregivers to learn more about disabilities in general, as well as available disability services, schemes, caregiver training opportunities and informal caregiver support groups. Caregivers of persons with disabilities who need more information on caregiver support services can also contact SG Enable at caregivers@sgenable.sg."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00093,2022-02-14-T-004,93,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Aside from the Enabling Guide, MSF and SG Enable work with Social Service Agencies to increase awareness of services. Touchpoints occur early as children are diagnosed with special needs at birth or as they develop. This is also the opportunity to begin better equipping caregivers of such young children. For example, SG Enable runs the ""Start Right"" workshop twice a month to provide information on Early Intervention (EI), the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children, or EIPIC, strategies for caregivers to engage their children at home, as well as available community resources and support."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00094,2022-02-14-T-004,94,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"EI centres also provide caregiver engagement and training under EIPIC, so that caregivers are equipped with the skills and knowledge to support their children at home. ECDA is also developing a guide for parents of preschool-age children who require early intervention, arising from a recommendation by the Inclusive Preschool Workgroup to strengthen support for parents. The parents' guide will include information on developmental needs, ways to access EI services, support available to facilitate the child's transition from the preschool years to school-age provisions, as well as self-care strategies and resources. We expect the guide to be ready by April this year."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00095,2022-02-14-T-004,95,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We want to assure caregivers that they are not alone in providing care for their loved ones. There are various care services that they can tap on. EI centres, as well as many preschools, provide support for children under the age of seven with developmental needs. Special Student Care Centres, or SSCCs, provide before-and-after school care service for children aged seven to 18. Day Activity Centres, or DACs, offer day programmes for adults with disabilities aged 18 and above on either a full-time or part-time basis. Children Disability Homes, or CDHs, and Adult Disability Homes, or ADHs, provide both long-term and short-term residential care services for persons with disabilities."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00096,2022-02-14-T-004,96,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SG Enable's ""Take-A-Break"" Pilot Programme provides short-term home-based respite services."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00097,2022-02-14-T-004,97,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Supporting the mental health and well-being of caregivers is essential to enable them to take good care of their loved ones and themselves. Caregivers who are distressed and need someone to speak to can call the National Care Hotline, the Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline, or the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) for support. In addition, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have worked with Social Service Agencies to set up caregiver community outreach teams, to provide emotional support for caregivers of persons with mental health conditions who have or are at risk of developing mental health needs. Caregivers of seniors and persons with mental health needs can visit the AIC website for information on eldercare services, community mental health services and caregiver support measures, such as financial support schemes and respite care."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00098,2022-02-14-T-004,98,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MSF has also appointed 10 Parenting Support Providers that offer evidence-based parenting support programmes for parents and caregivers of children. These include the Triple P Programme and Signposts that equip parents and caregivers with strategies to manage the child’s behaviour. MSF's evaluations indicate that attendees reported sustained reductions in parenting stress and improvements in children's behaviour.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00099,2022-02-14-T-004,99,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Parents and caregivers of children who require low levels of early intervention support and whose children require behavioural support can tap on such programmes as well.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00100,2022-02-14-T-004,100,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, supporting caregivers requires many helping hands. It is a whole-of-society effort involving not just the Government, but the community as well. One example is Project 3i, under the SG Together Alliance for Action for Caregivers of Persons with Disabilities, formed by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and SG Enable."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00101,2022-02-14-T-004,101,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Project 3i was started by CaringSG, an organisation set up and led by caregivers, for caregivers. Project 3i aims to strengthen community support for caregivers by connecting caregivers with others in the community, providing befriending and peer mentorship by trained caregivers, and providing caregivers and families with complex needs with advisory support from professional volunteers, including doctors, therapists, teachers and psychologists, to help them better navigate and access mainstream health and social services. We welcome more of such community-led and caregiver-led initiatives."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00102,2022-02-14-T-004,102,,"To all caregivers who are facing the challenges and stressors of taking care of their loved ones, please do reach out if you need any assistance. The caregiving journey can be a stressful one and caregivers need our strong support. In addition to having services and programmes available for them and their loved ones, it is equally important for family, friends and other caregivers to provide emotional support. Let us all play a part by extending a helping hand or a listening ear when we see someone in need."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00103,2022-02-14-T-004,103,Speaker,Ms Denise Phua.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00104,2022-02-14-T-004,104,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"I thank the Ministers; very grateful for the heart and hard work that both Ministries have put in. I speak as a disability service provider, a volunteer, a parent of a special needs adult and a parliamentarian. My worry is that the spate of unfortunate events concerning the recent two families will not be the last of it."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00105,2022-02-14-T-004,105,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Yes, it takes a village – all of us, the Government, disabilities agencies, families, volunteers. We need to take our place and organise better, to get better outcomes. I think when each party thinks that the other party should do it – whether the Government or somebody else – then no one will do it because no one wants to catch the ball alone. It is just too difficult. There are lots of things going on, quite a lot of overlaps, differing standards, noise and so forth."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00106,2022-02-14-T-004,106,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"So, two supplementary questions; I seek the Minister's assurance. One, at the macro level, to share more strategic information, not just when things happen or in Parliamentary settings. Also, involve the ground better."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00107,2022-02-14-T-004,107,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Strategic information, such as sizing the issue, validating the planning assumptions of the Government Ministries, communicating plans ahead for inputs, ensuring the right partners are onboard and information, such as how many students or adults with special education needs or disabilities are flowing through the system."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00108,2022-02-14-T-004,108,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"And what is the plan? What are the planning assumptions? Where do students go when they exit? What are their prognoses like? How are the current support models, especially in the mainstream schools where the two recent cases are cited? What can be done further to make it more effective? And what are all the immense challenges in the adult disability space?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00109,2022-02-14-T-004,109,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The issues are really not easy to be settled by just one party  whether it is people, public or private sector. It is all of us."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00110,2022-02-14-T-004,110,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"And then, how can we better tap on, especially train and support ground volunteers, such as those in the grassroots movement? I think there are many of them that have the hearts, but just not so organised, together by us. SG Cares volunteers, even parent groups themselves – how can we involve them and get just better outcomes?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00111,2022-02-14-T-004,111,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"So, that is my first question  how to share more strategic information throughout and involve the ground better?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00112,2022-02-14-T-004,112,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The second question is, how can we have stronger and more focused work to join the many dots, to peel the onions underneath all the wonderful programmes the Minister listed, to peel the onion further to get to the root causes and then get better outcomes. For example, we need to prevent so many overlaps, so many groups doing the same thing and to ensure better outcomes in not just caregiver support, but also awareness building and so forth."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00113,2022-02-14-T-004,113,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Hence, I just want to seek the Minister's assurance. I want to thank the Ministries and everybody who has been helping out, for helping out."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00114,2022-02-14-T-004,114,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for her very passionate supplementary questions. Among all of us, we know Ms Denise Phua, and we take a lot of instructions from Ms Denise Phua, from the way we organise and also, to the way we are shaping the disability space. Since I came into Parliament together with Ms Denise Phua, things have actually got so much better. By the time I arrived in MSF, it may look like a mess but it is because more things are being done. And, certainly, coordination must be made."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00115,2022-02-14-T-004,115,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"If it were only the Government, I think it is much easier to organise and coordinate but many helping hands are involved. They are really passionate people. People who are directly involved either as parents or people who really care. We want them to thrive, we want them to progress but we also have to be careful about over-organising them."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00116,2022-02-14-T-004,116,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In terms of institutional support, we have, for example, special student care centres, we have eight of them. They are mostly in the SPED schools. The question is, do we need more? How can we increase the effectiveness in terms of how we reach out to the parents who need them?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00117,2022-02-14-T-004,117,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Fortunately, today, since last week, for the longest time that we have been organising, we now have better touch points on the time because we now diagnose the children early, we know who the parents are and, therefore, we can do these touch points earlier. However, there will always be parents whom – because we did not, or during their time, did not have interventions early enough – we may not be able to identify who they are. But we know their families know them, we know their neighbours know them and even when I do house visits, I have met some families who have not been part of our system or did not know that these are available help that they can tap on."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00118,2022-02-14-T-004,118,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, I call upon the community, even if we think that no help is being extended to them, or it does not look like help is being extended to them, please reach out to us so that we can do this."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00119,2022-02-14-T-004,119,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00120,2022-02-14-T-004,120,He Ting Ru,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question relates to children who need extra support in schools. I have a few questions. First, how does the Ministry track how these children are doing in school? Secondly, how does the Ministry track how successful these measures of support are? And, finally, are there any proactive steps being taken within a framework, some kind of formal screening available, to identify students who might have learning difficulties or special needs and benefit from these forms of support, and also their families, their parents and their caregivers?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00121,2022-02-14-T-004,121,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to Ms He Ting Ru's questions, I will just make the following points. The tracking is on a continuous basis. Of course, the tracking is not based on the usual academic standards that we use. Very often, for the students with special education needs, if they are following the mainstream curriculum, then we track their progress. But very importantly, in this progress, we are not trying to measure themselves against other people. As I have always said, for us, it is more important to surpass ourselves than to surpass other people. For many of our children with special needs, the goal is really for them to improve over what they have been able to achieve the previous day, the previous year, to give themselves a sense of confidence, a sense of independence. And that is what, if you like, broadly how we measure our success, in a very broad way."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00122,2022-02-14-T-004,122,Chan Chun Sing,"The second point I would like to make is that we are always in close contact with the parents and the families, so that we can work hand in hand between the school and the families to help progress our children, each according to their potential. Where necessary, we will bring in the education, the professional psychologist to help equip both our teachers with the necessary skill-sets and also the parents with the necessary skill-sets to cope and to care for the children with special needs. So, it is not the kind of usual tracking that we would use for the usual academic yardsticks or performance yardsticks for typical children, but I think for each of the children with special needs, we have to customise the programme according to their needs."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00123,2022-02-14-T-004,123,Chan Chun Sing,"And I would like to make this point that, while we generally use the word ""special needs"", the special needs community is not homogeneous. Every child with special needs is special in their own ways and they do need different levels of support with different learning needs as well. So, that is why, to add on to what Minister Masagos says, because of the spectrum of needs, we also need a spectrum of solutions in order to best cater to the respective needs."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00124,2022-02-14-T-004,124,Speaker,Mr Ang Wei Neng.
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00125,2022-02-14-T-004,125,Ang Wei Neng,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank both the Ministers for the very comprehensive replies. MSF has, over the years, issued transport concession cards to persons with disabilities; it has the registry and has been helping them. So, I would like to ask if MSF would consider having a similar registry for the caregivers of persons with disability and proactively reach out to them, either through the Ministries or through the community, so we can all help them?"
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00126,2022-02-14-T-004,126,Ang Wei Neng,"I echo what our fellow Member, Ms Denise Phua, has said. Many of us want to try to help the caregivers in our respective constituencies, but we also lack resources and the know-how to help them. So, we really hope that the Ministry can come up with programmes and roll them out fast, besides the 3i initiative that we have. We really hope that the Ministry can work with the different segments of society, the population as a whole, so that we can all work together to better prevent this very sad case of a double murder."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00127,2022-02-14-T-004,127,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank Mr Ang for the question. The Alliance for Action (AfA) was launched, basically, to get more feedback from caregivers, organisations, parents on what more we need to do. We hope that this will be completed within this year, if not, earlier. And we will take those inputs on board, including the suggestion by the Member, to have a registry. Whether we want to actually do this from the Government, top-down view, my view is that we want to ask the caregivers and see whether this will help them, how it will help them and, at the same time, also have enough protection for their confidentiality, if they want it."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00128,2022-02-14-T-004,128,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, to pull a few of the threads together, maybe I will just make the following concluding points."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00129,2022-02-14-T-004,129,Chan Chun Sing,"First, I would like to thank all the professionals, teachers, caregivers and families who have extended help to our children with special needs and their families. I know it is very difficult when such an unfortunate incident happens. We will always ask if we could have all done more together to avoid this tragedy. We know that many of our professionals, families, caregivers and volunteers would want to do more."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00130,2022-02-14-T-004,130,Chan Chun Sing,"But deep in our heart, I think we also know that, sometimes, such cases are very hard to prevent altogether. Because it is so hard, I think we are all even more determined to want to do better."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00131,2022-02-14-T-004,131,Chan Chun Sing,"So, the first point is, yes, MOE and MSF, we are regularly reviewing the master plan on how we can provide the continuum of care across the entire life cycle stage, for both the special needs children and their caregivers."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00132,2022-02-14-T-004,132,Chan Chun Sing,"I know that for many of the special needs families, the part that is most challenging, the part that is most worrying for all the families with special needs children is  ""what happens when we are no longer around?"", ""what is the care arrangement, what are the financial arrangements that we need to put in place to take care of our children with special needs?"""
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00133,2022-02-14-T-004,133,Chan Chun Sing,"And this is where we will double down our efforts to see how we can provide a more seamless continuum, from the school years to the post-school years in terms of care, work arrangements and also financial independence."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00134,2022-02-14-T-004,134,Chan Chun Sing,"Secondly, we would also like to thank all of the volunteers for their efforts to step forward and chip in and, to the extent that we can, both MSF and MOE would like to work with our partners, the volunteers, the caregivers, and we are prepared to try out different ideas, new ideas, to cater to the spectrum of needs that we have discussed in this House. Because we really need a variety of solutions, a variety of know-hows, a variety of resources. Many of these things are very difficult to do because they require staying power, they require us to walk through those dark valleys of life with the person in need and their families. And we really, really give thanks for the many volunteers who have walked this journey."
2022-02-14-T-004-S-00135,2022-02-14-T-004,135,Chan Chun Sing,"So, I do not want the volunteers to feel that just because an unfortunate incident has happened, that, somehow, they have not done their part or they have not done enough. I think we also want to affirm the volunteers and professionals who have taken care of our children with special needs and their families as well."
2022-02-14-T-005-S-00136,2022-02-14-T-005,136,Speaker,Minister Shanmugam.
2022-02-14-T-005-S-00137,2022-02-14-T-005,137,K Shanmugam,"Sir, thank you for allowing me to make a clarification."
2022-02-14-T-005-S-00138,2022-02-14-T-005,138,K Shanmugam,"In answer to Ms Sylvia Lim's question, I pointed out that the amounts of fine imposed on the two officers are different. They are different. I should clarify that they were calculated by reference to the number of months of increment that they would have gotten. The number of months is the same for both officers, but the amounts they paid are different – and that is the fine that is being imposed. [Please refer to ""Update on Internal Investigations into Police Officers Involved in Parti Liyani v PP [2020] SGHC 187 Case"", Official Report, 14 February 2022, Vol 95, Issue No 47, Oral Answers to Questions section.]"
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00139,2022-02-14-T-006,139,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the public transport operators are required to train their bus captains in inclusive service delivery to assist commuters with special needs; (b) if so, what is the current proportion of bus captains who have been trained; and (c) whether the Ministry studies feedback from such commuters on service rendered to them by bus captains."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00140,2022-02-14-T-006,140,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, all public transport operators, or PTOs, have training programmes to equip bus captains, or BCs, with the skills to communicate with and assist commuters with special needs. PTOs also often share information on commuter inclusiveness to all BCs through their mobile applications to reiterate the importance of inclusivity."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00141,2022-02-14-T-006,141,Baey Yam Keng,"In addition, since November 2016, all new BCs are trained to identify and assist commuters with special needs as part of the Enhanced Vocational Licence Training Programme. This programme is conducted by the Singapore Bus Academy and all prospective BCs are required to attend it before obtaining their Omnibus Drivers' Vocational Licence. To date, over 6,300 BCs have graduated from this programme."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00142,2022-02-14-T-006,142,Baey Yam Keng,"Training materials are regularly reviewed based on feedback from commuters with special needs, as well as their caregivers, other members of public and various social service agencies."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00143,2022-02-14-T-006,143,Baey Yam Keng,"The Caring SG Commuters Committee, which was set up in 2020, also conducts regular engagements with commuters, including those with special needs, to gather feedback on their public transport experience. The Committee also works with the community to co-create solutions to improve their commuting experience and build a gracious and caring commuting culture. For example, through the Caring Commuter Champion initiative, we are growing a group of volunteers trained to offer assistance to commuters with mobility needs during their daily commute."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00144,2022-02-14-T-006,144,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00145,2022-02-14-T-006,145,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his detailed answer. It is especially good to hear that there is a detailed programme on inclusive service delivery. The reason why I asked this Parliamentary Question is also because of a resident's feedback, in the case of a child with special needs on a stroller that tried to get on board a bus. The bus captain did not offer any help simply because of the definition of a stroller, compared to a wheelchair, in that sort of scenario."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00146,2022-02-14-T-006,146,Saktiandi Supaat,"My supplementary question is, despite the detailed programme on inclusive service delivery that has been laid out by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary just now, whether in the interim, in the transition, can we improve discretionary elements embedded by bus captains going forward to deal with such issues, especially the definition of ""strollers"" for special needs children or adults, relative to ""wheelchair"" definitions."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00147,2022-02-14-T-006,147,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, for all wheelchair users on buses, the bus captains will be trained to activate the ramp to enable the wheelchair to go on board. In the case of a stroller, it might be less evident that the child or the caregiver has needs that the BC should offer assistance."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00148,2022-02-14-T-006,148,Baey Yam Keng,"But, in general, when commuters have mobility needs or are with children in strollers, they definitely should and could approach the BCs for help if they need to. That is why, in this journey of us providing a more inclusive commuting experience, it is a continuous effort to equip the BCs to be mindful of the different needs of different commuters and some needs are invisible. A child or person with special needs may, sometimes, not be apparent to others that that person needs help."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00149,2022-02-14-T-006,149,Baey Yam Keng,"That is why we also introduced a lanyard, where people with such needs can wear so that they are more identifiable by PT workers."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00150,2022-02-14-T-006,150,Baey Yam Keng,"I would suggest to the Member that his resident or commuter with such experience should give the direct feedback to the PTOs, so that the PTOs could incorporate such anecdotes into their training programme and the BCs are better equipped with knowledge to look out for such cases."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00151,2022-02-14-T-006,151,Baey Yam Keng,"I would just want to add also that for a successful inclusive commuting culture, it is not just the work of PTOs, BCs or PT workers. It is where every commuter can play a part as well. So, in that case, the caregiver, the mother could have also asked a fellow commuter whether the person could help her to bring the stroller up to the bus."
2022-02-14-T-006-S-00152,2022-02-14-T-006,152,Baey Yam Keng,That is why the Caring SG Commuters Committee is promoting a caring and gracious commuting culture within our public transport services. And the launch of the online training course for the certification and training of Caring Commuter Champions will help us to reach out to more commuters. We hope that more members of public will come on board this Caring Commuter Champion initiative.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00153,2022-02-14-T-007,153,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the effect of the exit of various electricity retailers in 2021 on the electricity bills of small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and (b) how is the Government monitoring or managing the capacity of the remaining retailers, so as to facilitate SMEs having options to manage their electricity costs."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00154,2022-02-14-T-007,154,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of five electricity retailers ceasing operations last year and many small and medium businesses (SMEs) having to shift back to SP Services' wholesale electricity plan, what support can be extended to these SMEs to provide more certainty to manage their business costs against very high increases in their monthly electricity charges, particularly those with average monthly electricity consumption of 4,000 kWh and above."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00155,2022-02-14-T-007,155,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether he can provide an update on the Temporary Electricity Support Scheme (TRECS) since it was introduced in December 2021; (b) whether the TRECS will be extended beyond February 2022; and (c) whether EMA will consider working with electricity retailers to provide a 12-month fixed electricity plan for smaller business consumers, specifically SMEs with a monthly consumption between 4,000 and 20,000 kWh."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00156,2022-02-14-T-007,156,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what support is available to SMEs; and (b) what are the options available to affected businesses, when their utilities costs have increased by large factors due to the insolvency of their previous utilities retailers."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00157,2022-02-14-T-007,157,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Question No 41, please."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00158,2022-02-14-T-007,158,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 41 to 45, as well as the Parliamentary Question filed by Mr Saktiandi Supaat"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00159,2022-02-14-T-007,159,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00160,2022-02-14-T-007,160,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, the world has been facing a global energy crunch since September last year. The price of LNG, or spot Liquefied Natural Gas, rose significantly and remains elevated at more than three times the levels as at the start of 2021."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00161,2022-02-14-T-007,161,Tan See Leng,"While our piped natural gas (PNG) supply typically helps to moderate the impact from higher LNG prices, there was a series of disruptions and planned depletions to our PNG supply since the second half of 2021. This confluence of factors has resulted and caused increased volatility in wholesale electricity prices. Since October 2021, EMA, or the Energy Market Authority, has implemented a set of measures to enhance Singapore's energy security and stabilise SWEM, or Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, prices."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00162,2022-02-14-T-007,162,Tan See Leng,"Nevertheless, some market participants were adversely affected by the volatility. Between October and December 2021, six electricity retailers exited the market and another two retailers prematurely terminated some of their customers' contracts. As a result, about 9% of all electricity consumer accounts were affected."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00163,2022-02-14-T-007,163,Tan See Leng,All affected households and businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than four megawatt hour (MWh) can switch to Singapore Power's regulated tariff at any time. Some businesses consuming four MWh or more managed to secure plans with other retailers.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00164,2022-02-14-T-007,164,Tan See Leng,"There remains about 11,000 business consumer accounts – accounting for about 1% of consumers – which have to buy electricity directly from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, or SWEM, and are thus exposed to more volatile electricity prices."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00165,2022-02-14-T-007,165,Tan See Leng,"To help these businesses, EMA worked with the generating companies, or gencos, to offer monthly fixed price plans under the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme, or TRECS for short, in January this year – that is, last month. The TRECS plans were fully subscribed for January. For the month of February, the initial offering of TRECS was also fully subscribed. In response to requests for more such contracts, EMA worked with gencos and electricity retailers to offer about 645 megawatts of TRECS and other plans with significant fixed price components. At least 200 megawatts of the contracts are still available and we are extending TRECS for March, April and May."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00166,2022-02-14-T-007,166,Tan See Leng,We encourage all consumers without a retail plan to consider taking up these contracts for greater certainty.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00167,2022-02-14-T-007,167,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, let me now turn to the issue of electricity prices. Singapore imports all of our energy and cannot be fully insulated from developments in the global energy market. Well, let me make a correction – Singapore imports a vast majority of our energy, not all of our energy. We still have some from solar. The higher fuel prices feed into our electricity bills to reflect the higher costs of electricity production."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00168,2022-02-14-T-007,168,Tan See Leng,"As I had mentioned during the Committee of Supply debates last year, we had been enjoying artificially low electricity prices for several years due to an over-investment in capacity and fuel by the gencos. I have also alluded to the fact that that was also below the cost of generating electricity; and thus, it was not sustainable. In fact, if Members of the House remember, I also put up a chart that clearly demarcated and showed that the cost of generation was higher than the cost of the electricity tariffs at that time."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00169,2022-02-14-T-007,169,Tan See Leng,"An electricity price correction was, therefore, unavoidable and the current global energy crunch has precipitated and exacerbated this correction."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00170,2022-02-14-T-007,170,,"Again, Members of this House would have asked what help is, therefore, available for the affected businesses. Household and small consumers which need help with their electricity bills can apply to SP Services for instalment payment plans. Businesses which need financing support can also make use of ESG's programmes, such as the Temporary Bridging Loan and Enterprise Financing Scheme SME Working Capital Loan."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00171,2022-02-14-T-007,171,,"The 11,000 or so business accounts without a long-term retail contract bear the brunt of the electricity crunch. To help them weather the storm, EMA has worked with gencos and electricity retailers to reduce the volatility and lower the cost of buying electricity through TRECS, additional monthly contracts offered by gencos, and on the wholesale market for businesses, as I had mentioned earlier. For example, Sembcorp Power Pte Ltd is offering one-month fixed price plans at preferred rates to consumers with average monthly consumption of between four and eight MWh."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00172,2022-02-14-T-007,172,,"EMA will also continue to monitor closely market developments, including heightened geopolitical tensions and their potential impact on global energy prices, and put in place the necessary measures to secure our energy supply, enhance stability and ensure the orderly functioning of the market."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00173,2022-02-14-T-007,173,,"Mr Speaker, Singapore has an open and competitive electricity market where prices will rise and fall depending on demand and supply conditions and developments in the global energy market. Over the last 20 years, our energy market has served us well. Our electricity supply is one of the most reliable and price-competitive amongst major developed cities."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00174,2022-02-14-T-007,174,,"Our energy market is now being tested by unprecedented shocks and volatility in the global energy markets. Nevertheless, we are committed to ensuring that Singapore's power supply remains secure and reliable, and to supporting our vulnerable customers during this period."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00175,2022-02-14-T-007,175,,"My only exhortation and urging is for all consumers to use energy prudently and to adopt energy conservation as a way of life. We will also learn from this episode to see how we can strengthen and fortify our energy reliance, resilience and our electricity market. And I am confident that, together, we will emerge from this stronger."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00176,2022-02-14-T-007,176,Speaker,Ms Jessica Tan.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00177,2022-02-14-T-007,177,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am very heartened to hear from the Minister that TRECS will be extended and also that there are more fixed monthly plans available to the SMEs; the shocks have been quite real for our SMEs because some were hit about three times."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00178,2022-02-14-T-007,178,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"While we all understand that, we are takers of energy prices. So, on Minister's last plea, can I ask this question of MTI  what measures are in place to support our companies and, especially our SMEs, in terms of moving to more sustainable practices as well as better energy consumption practices?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00179,2022-02-14-T-007,179,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The reason I ask this is because in resource-scarce Singapore, where we are moving more to automation and digitalisation, our companies are actually relying more on energy. So, it is good that we are focusing on reliance, resilience of our infrastructure – and we must – but we need to also help our companies pivot and move to being more energy-efficient as well. I hope the Minister can share with us what measures will be in place to support them."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00180,2022-02-14-T-007,180,Tan See Leng,"I thank Ms Jessica Tan for her very poignant reminder to all of us. There are quite a number of initiatives that we have moved on to. We have encouraged many businesses to consider using energy-efficient power systems, including energy-efficient light bulbs and even air conditioning. We have worked very closely with MSE where we would encourage companies to use devices or appliances with the triple-tick marks to improve energy efficiency and conserve energy."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00181,2022-02-14-T-007,181,Tan See Leng,"We have also started giving grants to help companies to pivot into using more solar photo-voltaic panels. On top of that, over at EMA, given the fact that we do not have a very constant and consistent supply of solar energy, we are also, in parallel, developing a series of energy storage systems in the form of ESS, so that, during the time when there is peak solar power, we can store up that energy to allow it for use later on."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00182,2022-02-14-T-007,182,Tan See Leng,"On top of that, in terms of the building of efficiency, we have encouraged industries to go green, where they can use natural ventilation, to even working with design consultancy firms in the entire built environment to see how we can actually reduce the need for lowering the temperature in terms of using the air conditioning."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00183,2022-02-14-T-007,183,Tan See Leng,There are multiple initiatives and they are probably too numerous for me to go through at length. These are just some very clear examples of what we have started to work with the industry on.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00184,2022-02-14-T-007,184,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00185,2022-02-14-T-007,185,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Thank you, Sir. Several businesses in my constituency have shared with me they are shocked at seeing their electricity bills jump threefold or more despite their efforts to reduce electricity usage. Businesses with consumption of more than four MWh but less than 20 MWh, which include many neighbourhood kopitiams, have to buy electricity from SP Group at the wholesale electricity price, which is very elevated and volatile now. They are also facing difficulty buying electricity from retailers because many retailers are not offering contracts until later in the year or even next year."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00186,2022-02-14-T-007,186,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Can EMA extend TRECS for another six to 12 months beyond May 2022, in view of the current economic and energy supply situation? If this is not possible, can EMA allow these SMEs to buy at the regulated tariff instead, so that their operational costs do not skyrocket?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00187,2022-02-14-T-007,187,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Secondly, the Minister mentioned that TRECS was fully subscribed for the months of January and February. How many businesses have applied for, during these two months under TRECS, but were not able to obtain contracts? Are there plans to expand the number of slots in TRECS available for those who need it?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00188,2022-02-14-T-007,188,Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. Can I answer the second question, and then I will go back to the first one? For TRECS, in January, it was oversubscribed. As I have shared earlier on in my main reply to a Parliamentary Question, for February, there still remains about 200 megawatts, and I was encouraging many of these SMEs to consider going into this particular retail plan."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00189,2022-02-14-T-007,189,Tan See Leng,"As far as the extension of TRECS for another six months is concerned, we have now extended for March, April and May. That is three months. Our estimates also tie in, generally, with the consultants, and these are global market consultants, who look at the trend of energy prices. Of course, we hope that the situation in Eastern Europe, namely, between Russia and Ukraine, does not get worse. But once winter is over, we are cautiously optimistic that natural gas prices will ease somewhat. So, we may not need to extend TRECS beyond six months."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00190,2022-02-14-T-007,190,Tan See Leng,"At this particular point in time, we are monitoring the situation very, very closely. In fact, we do not monitor on a month-to-month basis, but we monitor it on a weekly basis, and, sometimes, even on a daily basis."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00191,2022-02-14-T-007,191,Tan See Leng,I hope that answers the Member's question.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00192,2022-02-14-T-007,192,Tan See Leng,"Today, TRECS will be extended for March, April and through to May. But other than TRECS as a scheme, we are also now working to see whether there are any other assistance measures that we can roll-out to help. So, I hope that answers the Member's second point,"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00193,2022-02-14-T-007,193,Tan See Leng,"For his first question, in terms of the assistance, we have worked with electricity retailers and gencos to lower the cost of buying electricity through eligible contracts to support those businesses that have been affected. I do not have the data for how many businesses have not been able to subscribe to TRECS in January but, as a follow-up, what I can do is to try and get the statistics and then answer that either in another Parliamentary Question that the Member can file later, or I will see how to get that answer across."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00194,2022-02-14-T-007,194,Tan See Leng,We are also contemporaneously working with gencos to see if they can offer additional temporary discounts at their end.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00195,2022-02-14-T-007,195,Tan See Leng,"I just want to also manage expectations. These offsets will not be able to help account for the price increase completely. Because, as I have said before in the past, this has gone up by threefold since the start of 2021. But, certainly, it will go some way to help companies to adapt to the sudden surge in prices. I hope that clarifies."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00196,2022-02-14-T-007,196,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00197,2022-02-14-T-007,197,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"There is one question which I think was not answered, which is, is it possible for EMA to allow SMEs to buy – I am talking about SMEs which use between four MWh and 20 MWh of electricity a month – at the regulated tariff, instead of at the wholesale electricity price?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00198,2022-02-14-T-007,198,Tan See Leng,"The reason why we created TRECS was because we took into consideration the fact that, to expect Singapore Power, or SP, to suddenly open it up to everyone for them to buy, I think SP may have difficulty in supplying all that incremental needs in the short run."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00199,2022-02-14-T-007,199,Tan See Leng,"So, we need to also understand how the market works. Electricity which is offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing long-term vesting contracts with the gencos. SP has contracted a limited quantity of such long-term electricity contracts and we have to reserve them for households, for small business consumers, who, traditionally, do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00200,2022-02-14-T-007,200,Tan See Leng,"If we allow for large consumers to switch to the regulated tariffs, then this means that the SP Group will now have to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices and/or buy additional electricity supply from the SWEM at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Electric Price, or USEP. This will then cause the regulated tariffs to rise. So, all households and small consumers, who are, today, on the regulated tariff would then have to bear the costs of price stability for the large consumers. This may not necessarily be fair to household consumers and small business owners."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00201,2022-02-14-T-007,201,Tan See Leng,"Hence, as a result of that, we wanted to make sure that we can segregate it and protect the existing consumers, of which many of them are your residents as well, by making sure that we move and negotiate for a new scheme, TRECS, to help those that are in the four MWh to 20 MWh range. I hope this answers the Member's question."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00202,2022-02-14-T-007,202,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00203,2022-02-14-T-007,203,He Ting Ru,"I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. It seems that we have an idea of how many businesses are affected by the exit of all these gencos. But this increased business cost adds to the cost pressures on goods and services in general and this, ultimately, goes down to consumers and individuals or residents in the end."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00204,2022-02-14-T-007,204,He Ting Ru,"So, I would like to know, does the Ministry or the Government track or study the impact that this episode has actually had on the cost of living for individuals? And what are the findings of any such study?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00205,2022-02-14-T-007,205,Tan See Leng,"I thank Ms He Ting Ru for her question. I do not have the answer at this particular point in time. I understand the concerns that the Member has. If I may humbly request that she file a Parliamentary Question. We, certainly, will look into it and, probably, give her a more robust and detailed answer."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00206,2022-02-14-T-007,206,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00207,2022-02-14-T-007,207,Liang Eng Hwa,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, I understand that the reason the gencos were able to offer TRECS to the mid-sized consumers, the business consumers, is because they can draw on the standby LNG facilities set up by EMA. So, can I ask the Minister, is that the constraint why we cannot expand this TRECS scheme further to even larger consumers?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00208,2022-02-14-T-007,208,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, I am also concerned that if we keep tapping on this standby facility, in the event that there is an outbreak of conflict in Ukraine and so on, and LNG prices were to shoot up, do we have enough to manage the volatility that is to come and to secure the energy supply for our consumers?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00209,2022-02-14-T-007,209,Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa for his two fairly insightful questions. The first point in terms of the S-LNG, the emergency supply, the stock pile, whether it has become a constraint, the answer is no. As I have shared many times, for natural gas, we are sufficiently provided for and we will ensure that we continue to monitor very closely and, if necessary, invest in infrastructure to continue to make sure that our energy resilience and our sufficiency in terms of supplies will not be compromised."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00210,2022-02-14-T-007,210,Tan See Leng,"To the Member's question why larger companies cannot enter into longer-term contracts rather than on a month-to-month basis, it is, I think, because of the volatility in terms of the prices as well as the uncertainty that is evolving today, large companies which want to enter into contracts are now entering into contracts at new, very high-priced levels. If they were to lock in long-term contracts of a year or two years today, and if the stability comes back to some level of normality, they may find that they are at a disadvantage. Then, would they want to unwind the contract that they had gotten themselves into?"
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00211,2022-02-14-T-007,211,Tan See Leng,"Likewise, from the gencos' perspective, they are also not sure whether they can continue to buy or procure gas at current spot prices. In the event that they procure and they sign up, and the spot prices go up even further, they would take a bigger loss and a bigger impact."
2022-02-14-T-007-S-00212,2022-02-14-T-007,212,Tan See Leng,"So, it is that kind of bottlenecks that we have today. And so, that is why EMA has stepped in to see how we can manage for the current volatility, on a short-term basis, by offering these one-month temporary retail electricity contracts. I hope that clarifies."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00213,2022-02-14-T-008,213,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what types of jobs have been created by new investments brought in by EDB in the last three years; (b) how have the profiles of new investments changed and what are the anticipated trends in this area; and (c) how well is the local workforce positioned to benefit from the new investments in terms of skills and experience.
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00214,2022-02-14-T-008,214,Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how has the profile of investments in Singapore changed over the past 10 years; (b) given that electronics and biomedical manufacturing are the top two sources of investments in 2021, how well is our local workforce prepared for this growth; and (c) how can we continue to attract local talent in the electronics and manufacturing industries."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00215,2022-02-14-T-008,215,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 46 and 47 together, please."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00216,2022-02-14-T-008,216,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00217,2022-02-14-T-008,217,Alvin Tan,"EDB attracts investments in a wide range of sectors including manufacturing, professional services and infocommunications and media. Over the years, the profile of investments has moved towards higher value-added and innovation-focused activities, including in the semiconductor and biomedical manufacturing industries. For example, best-in-class companies, such as GlobalFoundries, Arkema and Sanofi, have chosen Singapore for their new manufacturing investments. We expect to attract more investments in advanced manufacturing, the digital economy and the green economy in the coming years."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00218,2022-02-14-T-008,218,Alvin Tan,"We attract these investments so that Singaporeans can benefit from the jobs that these investments create and to secure our economic future and resilience. Each investment strengthens our ecosystem and competitiveness, each investment creates more opportunities for firms to collaborate with one another, including between our SMEs and MNCs, and these, together, make Singapore more relevant to the world."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00219,2022-02-14-T-008,219,Alvin Tan,"Over the last three years, EDB attracted investments which created about 54,000 jobs across functions, such as production, digital, business services and innovation. These include jobs, such as software engineers, data scientists, lab technicians and consultants, and the majority of these are good paying jobs which are filled by locals."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00220,2022-02-14-T-008,220,Alvin Tan,"One reason why companies choose Singapore is our talent pool of local and complementary global talent. The Government and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) work closely with industry and the Labour Movement to equip our local workforce with relevant skills which companies need. By doing so, we can respond swiftly to the changing global economic landscape and opportunities. For example, Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programmes help locals to take on jobs in growth areas, as well as in redesigned job roles due to technological changes."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00221,2022-02-14-T-008,221,Alvin Tan,"The Government also works with larger companies to become ""Queen Bees"" by providing training opportunities for the whole ecosystem. For example, Bosch Rexroth partnered Singapore Polytechnic, Singapore-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, SSG and JTC to establish the Bosch Rexroth Regional Training Centre, which aims to train 1,500 workers in Industry 4.0 methods and technologies over the next five years. Last year, Siemens also expanded their Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre (AMTC), in partnership with JTC, SSG and other partners. AMTC will showcase Siemens' digital and industrial software, provide R&D platforms and resources for SMEs, expand training facilities and curricula to help upskill local and regional talent in Industry 4.0 capabilities."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00222,2022-02-14-T-008,222,Alvin Tan,"Besides training, MTI has also been working with industry players and IHLs to make engineering and manufacturing careers more attractive to locals, as part of our Manufacturing 2030 strategy. More details will be announced in due course."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00223,2022-02-14-T-008,223,Alvin Tan,"Even as we continue to grow our local timber, employers have provided feedback that they find it increasingly challenging to access the talent they require, especially in areas where there are skill shortages. This is a critical challenge we must overcome together, given the slowing growth in our local workforce and the aggressive competition posed by many cities and tech hubs for talent from all around the world."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00224,2022-02-14-T-008,224,Alvin Tan,"To stay competitive and resilient, Singapore must remain open to complementary talent. The Government will continue to calibrate changes in our foreign manpower policies to allow companies to access the talent and skills they need to grow our economy and to also ensure that these growth opportunities will create even better jobs for Singaporeans."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00225,2022-02-14-T-008,225,Speaker,Ms Foo Mee Har.
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00226,2022-02-14-T-008,226,Foo Mee Har,"Thank you, Speaker. I  would like to thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00227,2022-02-14-T-008,227,Foo Mee Har,"The first is  of the 54,000 jobs that were created in the last three years from the investments brought in by EDB, that Minister of State has mentioned, could he share, specifically, what is the percentage of these jobs that went to Singaporeans?"
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00228,2022-02-14-T-008,228,Foo Mee Har,"Also, related to that question is, for jobs where Singaporeans are currently without the skills or for areas where there are few qualified Singaporeans, how is EDB structuring the new investments such that firms are incentivised to tie the training of local staff and localisation of key positions to their business plans?"
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00229,2022-02-14-T-008,229,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for her questions. If I could share about the commitments of the companies and also the incremental number of jobs that will be created when the investments are fully realised, for the investments that EDB has attracted – and I focus on 2021 and these are the companies' own projections – approximately 80% of the jobs with salaries of more than $4,000 will be held by locals. However, this will, obviously, ultimately, depend on prevailing labour market conditions and also the ability of the companies themselves to identify suitable local talent."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00230,2022-02-14-T-008,230,Alvin Tan,"On the Member's question how do we then encourage or put our local workforce in the best possible stead to take on these jobs, I want to assure the Member that we take a multi-pronged approach to ensure that Singaporeans can benefit from all of these investments and all of these jobs that are being created. EDB and other agencies, like ESG, SSG and WSG, partner our companies on initiatives to develop their workforce and to create better career pathways for Singaporeans. Bosch and Siemens, which I mentioned in my main reply earlier, are such examples."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00231,2022-02-14-T-008,231,Alvin Tan,"We will also continue investing in Singaporeans through our education system and through various continuous education and training programmes such as Adapt and Grow, the Professional Conversion Programmes and SkillsFuture initiatives, for Singaporeans to upgrade themselves and to gain the relevant skills and experience to access these new jobs that we have brought in and the new jobs that are being created."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00232,2022-02-14-T-008,232,Alvin Tan,"We also have strong measures in place to ensure that Singaporeans are not discriminated against recruitment practices, such as the Fair Consideration Framework."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00233,2022-02-14-T-008,233,Alvin Tan,I also wanted to supplement this by saying that we regularly get feedback from companies on their challenges to find and also retain talent. Our agencies will continue their efforts to ensure that Singaporeans are equipped with the relevant experience and skills to seize these new opportunities that agencies like EDB bring in and create.
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00234,2022-02-14-T-008,234,Alvin Tan,"At the same time, this highlights also the necessity of welcoming complementary global talent with the skills, networks and expertise to enable our businesses to grow."
2022-02-14-T-008-S-00235,2022-02-14-T-008,235,Alvin Tan,"We are also being more focused to attract investments which are capital- and skills-intensive, rather than labour-intensive. In fact, many of the investments that we attracted last year – for example, those from Global Foundries, Sanifi, Dell Technologies – are expected to be highly productive and also to operate with lean workforces."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00236,2022-02-14-T-009,236,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry can provide the respective breakdown on the financial aid per capita that is currently provided to students studying in (i) NUS (ii) Yale-NUS College (iii) Polytechnics (iv) Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and (v) private Universities, such as SIM."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00237,2022-02-14-T-009,237,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Speaker, Government bursaries are available to Singaporean students from lower- and middle-income households at our publicly-funded Institutes of Higher Learning. The bursaries are tiered, with a higher level of support extended to those from lower-income households."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00238,2022-02-14-T-009,238,Gan Siow Huang,"The highest level of Government bursary support is for Singaporean students with gross monthly household income up to $2,750 or household per capita income up to $690. This corresponds to around the bottom 20% by household income. Autonomous University graduates from these households, including those from Yale-NUS College, can each receive an annual bursary of $6,200. For students enrolled in NUS and NTU general courses, this is equivalent to about 75% of annual tuition fees."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00239,2022-02-14-T-009,239,Gan Siow Huang,"Those enrolled in diploma programmes at the Polytechnics would each receive an annual bursary of $2,750, which is around 90% of annual tuition fees."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00240,2022-02-14-T-009,240,Gan Siow Huang,"Those enrolled in Higher Nitec and Nitec programmes at the ITE receive an annual cash bursary of $1,500, on top of having their annual tuition fees fully covered. Institutions also provide their own financial aid to students to further reduce any remaining out-of-pocket expenses and these are typically funded from donations."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00241,2022-02-14-T-009,241,Gan Siow Huang,"In addition to Government and institution bursaries, students have access to Government-funded loans that can be used to pay tuition fees. These are not means-tested and are interest-free during the course of study and payable only upon graduation or leaving the institution."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00242,2022-02-14-T-009,242,Gan Siow Huang,"Private education institutions (PEIs) are not part of the public education system and hence Government assistance is not extended to students at these institutions. PEI students may apply for financial aid offered by PEIs or tap on education loans offered by commercial banks, to finance their studies."
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00243,2022-02-14-T-009,243,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. Ministerial Statement. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean.
2022-02-14-T-009-S-00244,2022-02-14-T-009,244,Speaker,"[ Pursuant to Standing Order No 22(3), Written Answers to Question Nos 49-63, 71-75, 77-81, 85-92, 94, 96-98, 101-104 on the Order Paper are reproduced in the Appendix. The remaining Questions  have been postponed to a later Sitting of Parliament or withdrawn]"
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00245,2022-02-14-T-010,245,Teo Chee Hean,"Thank you, Mr Speaker."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00246,2022-02-14-T-010,246,Teo Chee Hean,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesian President Joko Widodo held their Leaders' Retreat on 25 January 2022 in Bintan, Indonesia. This was our first Leaders' Retreat since the start of COVID-19. It was also significant because the Leaders witnessed the signing by the respective Ministers of a set of agreements on three long-standing bilateral issues under an Expanded Framework."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00247,2022-02-14-T-010,247,Teo Chee Hean,"These agreements are  first, an Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) and the Singapore FIR; second, a Treaty for the Extradition of Fugitives (ET); and third, a Joint Statement between the Defence Ministers on the 2007 Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA)."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00248,2022-02-14-T-010,248,Teo Chee Hean,"My Indonesian counterpart, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investments, Luhut Pandjaitan, and I also signed an Exchange of Letters in which our governments committed to bring these agreements into force simultaneously."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00249,2022-02-14-T-010,249,Teo Chee Hean,"Following the Leaders' Retreat, several Members have filed Parliamentary Questions, regarding the nature of the agreements and their impact on Singapore. Minister Iswaran and I will address Questions for Oral Answer filed by several Members, namely, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Poh Li San, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Pritam Singh and a Question for Written Answer filed by Miss Cheryl Chan from today's Order Paper, as well as the Question for Oral Answer filed by Mr Gerald Giam1 for a future Sitting."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00250,2022-02-14-T-010,250,Teo Chee Hean,"I will cover the principles upon which the Expanded Framework was negotiated, the main elements of the agreements, their implications for our bilateral relations and the implementation of the agreements. Minister Iswaran will elaborate with further details on the FIR Agreement."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00251,2022-02-14-T-010,251,Teo Chee Hean,"With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I please ask the Clerks to distribute an infographic on the agreements under the Expanded Framework for Members' reference?"
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00252,2022-02-14-T-010,252,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00253,2022-02-14-T-010,253,Teo Chee Hean,"Thank you. The FIR, extradition and military training issues have been on our bilateral agenda for several decades. I had been personally involved in handling some of these issues at various points in time during my previous career in the SAF and, subsequently, as a Cabinet Minister."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00254,2022-02-14-T-010,254,Teo Chee Hean,"Over the years, we have been working with successive Indonesian governments to resolve these issues. We first signed agreements on the FIR and military training 27 years ago in 1995, but the FIR Agreement could not be implemented due to external factors in the process of submitting it for approval by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The 1995 military training agreement was implemented but lapsed after a few years."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00255,2022-02-14-T-010,255,Teo Chee Hean,"In 2007, we made another attempt and concluded agreements on the DCA and ET, and agreed to implement them simultaneously. However, the agreements were not ratified by Indonesia."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00256,2022-02-14-T-010,256,Teo Chee Hean,"In 2019, President Jokowi was elected to a second term. Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi enjoy a good relationship, and our two countries and governments have strong ties. Both leaders were of the view that the conditions were right to discuss and resolve the outstanding issues decisively, in an open, constructive and mutually beneficial manner."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00257,2022-02-14-T-010,257,Teo Chee Hean,"Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi tasked me and Coordinating Minister Luhut, whom I know well, to put maximum effort into this. We worked out a Framework for Discussions as a basis for our two governments to discuss the FIR and Singapore's military training in the South China Sea. This Framework was endorsed by Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi at the previous Leaders' Retreat in October 2019 to resolve these two issues separately but concurrently."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00258,2022-02-14-T-010,258,Teo Chee Hean,"The Framework laid out a set of considerations and principles, and acknowledged that the core interests and rights of both countries must be recognised and respected."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00259,2022-02-14-T-010,259,Teo Chee Hean,"In the course of the negotiations, in April 2021, at Indonesia's request, we expanded this Framework to include the ET. Our two countries have worked together on this issue before. It was in our interests to reach an agreement on the extradition of fugitives that would strengthen our bilateral cooperation in tackling criminal matters. The inclusion of the ET would help conclude a set of agreements on these three outstanding issues that would be acceptable to both sides."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00260,2022-02-14-T-010,260,Teo Chee Hean,"The set of agreements under the Expanded Framework for Discussions was carefully negotiated to achieve a good balance of benefits for both sides which are durable and for the long haul. It is underpinned by full respect for the sovereignty of both countries. It is in accordance with international law, in particular, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and protects our mutual interests."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00261,2022-02-14-T-010,261,Teo Chee Hean,"At the Leaders' Retreat, both governments also exchanged letters undertaking to bring the three agreements that we have reached – on the FIR, Extradition and Defence Cooperation – into force simultaneously."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00262,2022-02-14-T-010,262,Teo Chee Hean,Let me now touch on each of the agreements.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00263,2022-02-14-T-010,263,Teo Chee Hean,"FIR arrangements are established under ICAO for the purpose of managing civil aircraft in order to ensure the safety and efficiency of air traffic and to advance international civil aviation. Members would be aware that Indonesia had expressed its desire to realign the FIR boundaries in accordance with its expanded territorial waters which include archipelagic waters newly provided for under UNCLOS in 1982. Singapore's interest was the present and future needs of Changi Airport, which Indonesia accepted."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00264,2022-02-14-T-010,264,Teo Chee Hean,"The FIR Agreement that we concluded under our Expanded Framework addressed these key considerations. Singapore and Indonesia agreed to realign the boundary between the Singapore and Jakarta FIRs, largely taking into account Indonesia's archipelagic and territorial baselines, which were deposited with the UN in 2009."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00265,2022-02-14-T-010,265,Teo Chee Hean,"Indonesia will also delegate to Singapore the provision of air navigation services in portions of the airspace within the realigned Jakarta FIR, to ensure that present and future traffic to Changi Airport and nearby Indonesian airports continue to be managed safely and efficiently."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00266,2022-02-14-T-010,266,Teo Chee Hean,The delegation arrangement will last for 25 years and shall be extended by mutual consent if both countries find it beneficial to do so.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00267,2022-02-14-T-010,267,Teo Chee Hean,"When all the agreements under the Expanded Framework have been ratified through our respective domestic processes, Singapore and Indonesia will jointly seek ICAO's approval for these new FIR arrangements."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00268,2022-02-14-T-010,268,Teo Chee Hean,We believe that the FIR arrangements will benefit the aviation sectors of both countries and airspace users in the region.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00269,2022-02-14-T-010,269,Teo Chee Hean,Minister Iswaran will elaborate further on the specifics of the agreement in his Ministerial Statement.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00270,2022-02-14-T-010,270,Teo Chee Hean,"On military training, the Singapore and Indonesian governments agreed to ratify and bring into force the DCA and the Implementing Arrangement between the SAF and the Indonesian Armed Forces for the Military Training Area in Indonesia – both agreements as signed in 2007."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00271,2022-02-14-T-010,271,Teo Chee Hean,"Our two defence establishments have enjoyed decades of close friendship. As common security challenges become more complex, we need to work together closely all the more."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00272,2022-02-14-T-010,272,Teo Chee Hean,The DCA will strengthen cooperation between our armed forces and advance our bilateral defence relations. It will facilitate the discussion and oversight of new areas of defence cooperation between our two defence establishments.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00273,2022-02-14-T-010,273,Teo Chee Hean,"The SAF has been conducting its training in the designated South China Sea Danger Area (SCSDA) since the 1960s, when the area was international waters. Subsequently, parts of the SCSDA became Indonesian archipelagic and territorial waters and airspace under UNCLOS. However, the SAF's training activities in such areas continue, as a right provided for under Article 51 of UNCLOS."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00274,2022-02-14-T-010,274,Teo Chee Hean,"When the DCA comes into force, it will provide clarity on the arrangements for the SAF's training in Indonesian archipelagic and territorial waters and airspace, with full respect for Indonesia's sovereignty over its territory, while preserving Singapore's rights."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00275,2022-02-14-T-010,275,Teo Chee Hean,"The third agreement we signed was the Extradition Treaty or ET. Under the ET, Singapore and Indonesia will grant extradition for a comprehensive list of extraditable offences covered by the treaty, in accordance with the laws of both countries and subject to the requisite safeguards and provisions in the ET."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00276,2022-02-14-T-010,276,Teo Chee Hean,"The ET is substantively similar to the treaty that we had signed in 2007. The only change is in its retrospective application to extradite fugitives for crimes committed 18 years ago, as compared to 15 years in the 2007 agreement, starting from the time that the ET comes into force. This change was made at Indonesia's request. We believe that the extension will provide more flexibility in the scope of cooperation for both countries."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00277,2022-02-14-T-010,277,Teo Chee Hean,The benefits of the ET to both countries are clear. It will strengthen cooperation between our law enforcement agencies in combatting crime. Our hope is that the ET will also be helpful to Indonesia's own efforts to prevent suspected criminals from fleeing overseas and for them to be apprehended in Indonesia.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00278,2022-02-14-T-010,278,Teo Chee Hean,"Even without an ET, we already work closely with Indonesia to tackle these criminal matters. The ET will complement our existing cooperation with Indonesia through the ASEAN Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (ASEAN MLAT) and other multilateral treaties that we are party to. It also adds to Singapore's extradition arrangements with many jurisdictions across the globe."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00279,2022-02-14-T-010,279,Teo Chee Hean,"More fundamentally, the ET reflects both countries' commitment to work with international partners to combat crime and uphold the rule of law. This will help to enhance Singapore's role as a responsible and effective member of the international community, with a positive impact on our already good standing and reputation as a global financial hub."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00280,2022-02-14-T-010,280,Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, I have covered in some detail the scope of the agreements under the Expanded Framework to help Members of this House better understand how the conclusion of this set of agreements is a significant milestone for Singapore-Indonesia relations and is beneficial to both countries."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00281,2022-02-14-T-010,281,Teo Chee Hean,"We have had negotiations on these issues since the 1990s. Singapore has always approached these discussions with our close neighbour Indonesia with sincerity and in the spirit of cooperation. We strive to reach a balance of benefits, taking into account each other's rights and interests. This was our approach in 1995 and in 2007, when we had previously reached agreement on these issues, though the agreements had subsequently either lapsed or could not be implemented for reasons beyond our control."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00282,2022-02-14-T-010,282,Teo Chee Hean,"We have maintained this same spirit and approach through the years. The negotiations to arrive at this set of agreements under the Expanded Framework involved many rounds of negotiations since 2019, made even more challenging by the fact that most of the negotiations were carried out during the COVID-19 period. Our negotiators spent many weeks in quarantine as a result of that and we have many Zoom meetings."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00283,2022-02-14-T-010,283,Teo Chee Hean,"We were able to reach agreement between Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi because both had a strong desire to resolve these issues decisively and amicably, based on the Framework they endorsed."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00284,2022-02-14-T-010,284,Teo Chee Hean,"This set of agreements represents a win-win outcome. They are balanced, mutually beneficial and durable agreements for the long haul. They will provide a strong foundation to further strengthen our bilateral relations."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00285,2022-02-14-T-010,285,Teo Chee Hean,"Both sides are currently going through their respective domestic processes to ratify these agreements. Both Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi have expressed the desire to ratify and bring these agreements into force simultaneously, soon."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00286,2022-02-14-T-010,286,Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Pritam Singh asked what will happen at the end of the 25-year duration of the FIR Agreement. I should first say that the duration of the FIR Agreement, 25 years, will provide a durable and firm basis for cooperation in this important area for a generation or more. The focus of both sides now is to implement this set of agreements by bringing all of them through our respective domestic processes and, in the case of the FIR, subsequently, to ICAO."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00287,2022-02-14-T-010,287,Teo Chee Hean,This agreement shall remain in force for 25 years and shall be extended by mutual consent if both countries find it beneficial to do so.
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00288,2022-02-14-T-010,288,Teo Chee Hean,"Singapore and Indonesia recognise that we will always be neighbours and that we should continue to work together as partners. This agreement and the principles underlying it provide a good basis for future cooperation where each side brings something to the table and we work together to create a larger outcome, where the whole is bigger than the sum of all its parts. We certainly hope and have confidence that, after 25 years, this same spirit will prevail."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00289,2022-02-14-T-010,289,Teo Chee Hean,"We had a capable and cohesive negotiating team, who identified our interests clearly and pushed for them energetically and diplomatically. We had capable and committed negotiating partners, too, on the Indonesian side, who also worked very hard to push for their interests. But both sides also knew that we had a shared interest in closer bilateral cooperation and the benefits that that would bring. As a result, we were able to reach a good set of agreements that are win-win."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00290,2022-02-14-T-010,290,Teo Chee Hean,"The most important factor to ensure that Singapore always has a good hand to bring to the table in any negotiations, is to have a strong, clear thinking, trustworthy and capable Government which is supported by a united people. It is this trust and unity of our people behind us that allow us to conduct negotiations with consistency and confidence. This provides the foundation for building good relations and creates a conducive environment for negotiations, so that we can arrive at a good outcome."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00291,2022-02-14-T-010,291,Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, in closing this Statement, it has been my honour and privilege to work with our Indonesian counterparts and witness our bilateral relations strengthen over many years, from the 1970s onwards. It gives me particular satisfaction to have played some part in this latest chapter in our long-standing cooperation. The signing of this set of agreements and our ability to resolve long-standing and complex bilateral issues in an open and constructive manner demonstrate the strength and maturity of our bilateral relations."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00292,2022-02-14-T-010,292,Teo Chee Hean,"I would like to thank my counterpart Coordinating Minister Luhut and the teams of Ministers and officials involved on both sides who have worked hard to attain the best results in the best interests of both countries. I am confident that, when implemented, these agreements will create opportunities for even closer collaborations in civil aviation, criminal matters and defence cooperation, and also pave the way for us to advance our bilateral relations with Indonesia with friendship, mutual trust and confidence."
2022-02-14-T-010-S-00293,2022-02-14-T-010,293,Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now request that Minister S Iswaran make his Statement."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00294,2022-02-14-T-011,294,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean has explained the key considerations underpinning the agreements signed at the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders' Retreat on 25 January 2022, the main elements of the agreements, their implications for our bilateral relations and the implementation process."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00295,2022-02-14-T-011,295,S Iswaran,"I will now bring Members through the specifics of the Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) and the Singapore FIR, and respond to the various questions from Members on the considerations, implications and the way forward for the FIR Agreement."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00296,2022-02-14-T-011,296,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first outline how civil air traffic is managed around the world."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00297,2022-02-14-T-011,297,S Iswaran,"Every state has its own territorial airspace over which it has sovereignty. Then, there are Flight Information Regions (FIRs), which are blocks of airspace assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to air navigation services (ANS) providers, such as the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), for the purpose of managing civil air traffic. FIRs do not have to follow territorial boundaries."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00298,2022-02-14-T-011,298,S Iswaran,The provision of ANS around the world falls into three broad models.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00299,2022-02-14-T-011,299,S Iswaran,"The first is where the state provides ANS for an FIR that is within its territorial airspace. For example, the Aeronautical Radio of Thailand Limited (Aerothai) provides ANS for Thai airspace within the Bangkok FIR."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00300,2022-02-14-T-011,300,S Iswaran,"The second is where the state provides ANS within its FIR, but the FIR extends beyond its territorial airspace. For example, Indonesia provides ANS over Christmas Island, which is part of Australia's airspace but within the Jakarta FIR. Likewise, the US provides ANS over Canadian airspace within US FIRs."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00301,2022-02-14-T-011,301,S Iswaran,"The third is where the state provides ANS in the FIR and territorial airspace of a neighbouring state. This is typically done through delegation arrangements. For example, in order to manage traffic for Geneva Airport, Switzerland provides air traffic services for French airspace that is part of the Marseille FIR through a delegation arrangement."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00302,2022-02-14-T-011,302,S Iswaran,"So, territorial airspace, FIRs and the provision of ANS. These come together across the world in different models. But regardless of the model adopted, the paramount objective is to ensure the safety and efficiency of international civil aviation in accordance with ICAO rules."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00303,2022-02-14-T-011,303,S Iswaran,"The FIR issue has been on the Indonesia-Singapore bilateral agenda for several decades. Its resolution will bring clarity not just to both countries, but also to the international civil aviation community. It would also lay the foundation for us to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the aviation sector and across our broader relationship."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00304,2022-02-14-T-011,304,S Iswaran,"Singapore and Indonesia, therefore, agreed to discuss the FIR issue as an integral part of a broader framework, endorsed by Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi, to achieve a durable and balanced set of agreements that meets both sides' core interests."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00305,2022-02-14-T-011,305,S Iswaran,"Our aim was to  first, uphold the safety and efficiency of international civil aviation; second, meet Indonesia's desire to align the FIR boundaries to correspond with its territorial airspace; and third, accommodate current traffic and future growth of Changi and Indonesian airports."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00306,2022-02-14-T-011,306,S Iswaran,"The negotiations entailed significant involvement and commitment at all levels of Government, given the strategic, political, operational and technical considerations."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00307,2022-02-14-T-011,307,S Iswaran,"Based on the parameters endorsed by the two Leaders, Coordinating Ministers, Ministers and officials from multiple agencies were involved in the negotiations. MOT/CAAS officials, especially ANS experts, worked closely with their Indonesian counterparts to address the complex technical details, taking into account ICAO rules."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00308,2022-02-14-T-011,308,S Iswaran,"The outcome of this consultative negotiation process is an FIR Agreement that ensures the safety and efficiency of air traffic, addresses Indonesia and Singapore's interests and needs, and benefits international civil aviation."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00309,2022-02-14-T-011,309,S Iswaran,Mr Gerald Giam asked about the air traffic arrangements under the FIR Agreement. Let me briefly take Members through the key elements.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00310,2022-02-14-T-011,310,S Iswaran,"First, realignment of the FIR boundary. The boundary between the Jakarta FIR and the Singapore FIR will be realigned to meet Indonesia's desire to realign the FIR boundaries, and largely take into account Indonesia's territorial baselines."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00311,2022-02-14-T-011,311,S Iswaran,"Second, delegation arrangement. Indonesia will delegate to Singapore the provision of ANS for the airspace closest to Changi, to meet Changi Airport's current and future needs."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00312,2022-02-14-T-011,312,S Iswaran,"Third, under the delegation arrangement, CAAS will provide ANS, such as air traffic services, publication of aeronautical information and designing of air routes within the airspace where the provision of ANS has been delegated to Singapore. The FIR Agreement also caters for civil-military cooperation in air traffic management, based on ICAO provisions."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00313,2022-02-14-T-011,313,S Iswaran,"Fourth, the delegation arrangement under the FIR Agreement is for 25 years and shall be extended by mutual consent if both sides find it beneficial to do so. Indonesia and Singapore will consult each other and ICAO prior to the end of the 25 years, to ensure safety and efficiency of international civil aviation beyond the 25 years."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00314,2022-02-14-T-011,314,S Iswaran,"Ms Poh Li San, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Gerald Giam asked about the implications of the FIR Agreement. Miss Cheryl Chan also asked the same in a question for written response."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00315,2022-02-14-T-011,315,S Iswaran,"The FIR Agreement decisively resolves a key longstanding issue on the bilateral agenda and paves the way for closer cooperation in air traffic management and other aviation issues. It clarifies how ANS will be provided in this busy and complex airspace and ensures that air traffic flows in our region, including to and from Changi and Indonesian airports, will continue to be safe and efficient. Let me elaborate."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00316,2022-02-14-T-011,316,S Iswaran,"Every major airport in the world has a contiguous block of airspace for its arrival and departure procedures, which is essential for ensuring safety. It is necessary to deconflict aircraft when they are taking off or landing, which are critical phases of flight and when safety risks are the highest. Changi Airport, for example, had nearly 400,000 flights each year pre-COVID-19."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00317,2022-02-14-T-011,317,S Iswaran,The FIR Agreement allows Singapore to continue providing ANS within a contiguous block of airspace which is sufficient for Changi Airport's present and future needs. It will support the continued growth and competitiveness of Singapore's air hub and aviation-related sectors.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00318,2022-02-14-T-011,318,S Iswaran,"The FIR Agreement will also ensure the safe and efficient management of traffic to Indonesian airports, including Batam, Bintan and Tanjung Pinang airports, which are in close proximity to Changi."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00319,2022-02-14-T-011,319,S Iswaran,"The international civil aviation community will also benefit. The International Air Transport Association forecasts that air traffic in the Asia-Pacific will have the highest growth globally over the next 20 years. With the FIR Agreement and closer bilateral cooperation, airlines and other aviation stakeholders will have more opportunities to tap on the future growth in air traffic in this region, grow their operations, connect more passengers, attract more investments and create more jobs in our regional aviation sector."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00320,2022-02-14-T-011,320,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in short, the FIR Agreement is a significant milestone in our bilateral transport relationship with Indonesia, which will bring benefits to Singapore, Indonesia and the international civil aviation community."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00321,2022-02-14-T-011,321,S Iswaran,"Ms Poh Li San and Mr Melvin Yong asked about the implementation of the FIR Agreement. As explained by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, the FIR Agreement, Defence Cooperation Agreement and Extradition Treaty are to be brought into force and implemented simultaneously."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00322,2022-02-14-T-011,322,S Iswaran,"For the FIR Agreement, first, the domestic processes for both sides to ratify all three agreements have to be completed. Second, the technical teams are working through the detailed coordination procedures for the FIR Agreement, which are necessary to ensure a smooth transition in air navigation arrangements and to uphold safety and efficiency. Third, Singapore and Indonesia will jointly consult all relevant stakeholders and submit a Proposal for Amendment for the FIR boundary realignment and delegation arrangement to ICAO for approval. Fourth, once the FIR boundary realignment and delegation arrangements are approved by ICAO, Indonesia and Singapore will agree on a date to implement the FIR Agreement and for all the three agreements to enter into force together."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00323,2022-02-14-T-011,323,S Iswaran,Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked what will happen after the 25-year duration of the FIR Agreement. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean has spoken on this. Let me add from the civil aviation perspective.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00324,2022-02-14-T-011,324,S Iswaran,This is a durable FIR Agreement. We will have 25 years to implement the FIR Agreement and gain experience from the new arrangements. It will allow both sides to strengthen our bilateral transport ties and it establishes a foundation for further cooperation in the provision of ANS and in other areas.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00325,2022-02-14-T-011,325,S Iswaran,"The aviation sector will continue to develop with advancements in technology and ANS procedures. As air traffic and airports grow, our operational needs and aviation standards will also evolve. All these elements will shape the circumstances under which we will make decisions in the future. Under the FIR Agreement, the delegation arrangement shall be extended by mutual consent, should both sides find it beneficial to do so. Singapore and Indonesia have agreed to consult each other and ICAO before the end of the 25 years, to ensure the safety and efficiency of international civil aviation beyond the 25-year duration."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00326,2022-02-14-T-011,326,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in summary, the FIR Agreement is a key pillar of the Expanded Framework, which will advance our mutual interests."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00327,2022-02-14-T-011,327,S Iswaran,We were able to achieve this outcome because both sides approached the negotiations with a shared commitment to uphold the safety and efficiency and support the growth of international civil aviation. It has also laid a firm foundation for closer cooperation in aviation and other areas between Indonesia and Singapore.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00328,2022-02-14-T-011,328,S Iswaran,"In closing, I would like to express our deep appreciation to the negotiating teams from Singapore and Indonesia, in particular, our MOT and CAAS officers, for their hard work in concluding the agreement and achieving an outcome that is good for Singapore, Indonesia and international civil aviation."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00329,2022-02-14-T-011,329,Speaker,"Clarifications, please? Mr Pritam Singh."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00330,2022-02-14-T-011,330,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have one supplementary question as a follow-up to my Parliamentary Question, which is listed as Question No 5 in the Order Paper."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00331,2022-02-14-T-011,331,Pritam Singh,What vis-à-vis the Framework Agreement is the dispute resolution clause in the event either Singapore or Indonesia cannot come to an agreement after the end of the 25-year period?
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00332,2022-02-14-T-011,332,Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, as I have said, our focus right now is to get the ratification done through the domestic processes of both sides. This is an indication of how both countries can work together and work their own domestic processes for the joint benefit of both countries."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00333,2022-02-14-T-011,333,Teo Chee Hean,"Each of the agreements lasts for 25 years – the DCA and the FIR Agreement. If there are disputes, both sides will consult and reach an amicable settlement. What happens after 25 years is that the existing arrangements will continue until we reach a new agreement."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00334,2022-02-14-T-011,334,Teo Chee Hean,"For the FIR, Singapore will certainly continue to discharge its responsibilities to provide air navigation services in a safe and efficient way for civil air traffic."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00335,2022-02-14-T-011,335,Speaker,Ms Jessica Tan.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00336,2022-02-14-T-011,336,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two clarifications. On the point of what the Senior Minister has said, the focus is to get the expanded agreement in force. So, I guess the question is what is being done now to ensure that those agreements will come into force? How do we get these three agreements into force?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00337,2022-02-14-T-011,337,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"On another question  the Minister for Transport had indicated that these agreements, like the FIR, will benefit Changi Airport and Singapore. But could the Minister provide more information and details on how these would benefit both Changi Airport as well as Singapore?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00338,2022-02-14-T-011,338,Teo Chee Hean,"On bringing the three agreements into force simultaneously, as I have said in my Statement, both Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi have expressed the desire to bring these three agreements into force as soon as possible. Each side will have to go through their own domestic ratification processes, and I do understand that Indonesia has already commenced this process. We are also going through the process on our side."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00339,2022-02-14-T-011,339,Speaker,Mr S Iswaran.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00340,2022-02-14-T-011,340,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her question, which is an important one, specifically, how this agreement benefits Changi Airport. So, if I may underscore a point that I made earlier, this is an agreement that does not just benefit Changi Airport, it actually also benefits Indonesian airports, for example, Batam, Bintan and Tanjung Pinang and, perhaps most crucially, it also benefits international civil aviation on the point of ensuring its safety and efficiency."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00341,2022-02-14-T-011,341,S Iswaran,"And once we keep that as the baseline, then we can look ahead because what it means is that despite all the forecasts for growth in aviation in the Asia Pacific region, unless we are able to ensure traffic is managed well, smoothly and, most importantly, safely, we will not be able to benefit collectively or individually from that growth. So, what this agreement does is that it not only gives us clarity on an important matter for both sides but also for the international aviation community which has a strong interest in this matter."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00342,2022-02-14-T-011,342,S Iswaran,"With that as the foundation, we can then proceed to work on other important initiatives, whether it is investment in technology, infrastructure and also building closer cooperation between Indonesia and Singapore, in terms of aviation cooperation and, of course, extending beyond that into other areas."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00343,2022-02-14-T-011,343,S Iswaran,"So, I would say that, at its core, this agreement, once it has gone through the entire process and comes into force, it will provide clarity, certainty and, therefore, give confidence to all parties involved to then proceed with the necessary initiatives to prepare for the growth in aviation in our part of the world."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00344,2022-02-14-T-011,344,Speaker,Mr Vikram Nair.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00345,2022-02-14-T-011,345,Vikram Nair,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think these agreements are very good for both Singapore and Indonesia. I just have one clarification."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00346,2022-02-14-T-011,346,Vikram Nair,"The intention is for all the agreements to come into force at the same time. But if, in the ratification process, say, only one or two get ratified and one or two did not, what will happen to all three agreements in that situation?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00347,2022-02-14-T-011,347,Teo Chee Hean,"The agreement between both countries is to bring into force all three agreements simultaneously. There is good reason for it. It is because the negotiations were conducted concurrently and it has achieved a good balance of benefits across all three agreements. Hence, both countries have agreed that the best way to resolve these three outstanding issues is to discuss them together, come to agreements on them at the same time and then to bring them into force concurrently."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00348,2022-02-14-T-011,348,Teo Chee Hean,That will provide a resolution to all these three outstanding issues at the same time. I think that will bring many benefits to both countries so that it will reduce any chances of misunderstandings and provide a very strong basis for future cooperation.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00349,2022-02-14-T-011,349,Teo Chee Hean,"I should say that in any negotiation, of course, each side would want to push for its maximum benefits."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00350,2022-02-14-T-011,350,Teo Chee Hean,"But to have a good outcome, each side also has to look at the wider benefits, the wider interests that come from working together and arriving at an agreement, rather than not having an agreement. So, I think that in these negotiations, both sides took that view – that it is actually in our shared interest, in our enlightened self-interests, to come to an agreement on these three outstanding issues so that we can progress our bilateral relations on a broader front."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00351,2022-02-14-T-011,351,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00352,2022-02-14-T-011,352,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, under this agreement, before the end of the 25 years, is Indonesia permitted to apply to ICAO to manage the airspace which is delegated to Singapore to manage if they feel that they are ready to provide air navigation services and this could include the airspace closest to Changi Airport? If so, how would the change in ANS provider affect aviation safety and security, the efficiency and the status of us as an aviation hub? Secondly, will the Government be making available the maps of the new Flight Information Regions for the public to have a better picture, literally, of the outcome of these agreements?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00353,2022-02-14-T-011,353,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. If I may reiterate, the delegation arrangement under the FIR Agreement is for 25 years and it also states that it shall be extended by mutual consent if both sides find it beneficial to do so. Indonesia and Singapore will consult each other and ICAO prior to the end of 25 years to ensure safety and efficiency of international civil aviation beyond the 25 years."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00354,2022-02-14-T-011,354,S Iswaran,"Therefore, this is an agreement and, at its heart, its durability is underpinned by this set of provisions. Any deviations from this will have to be resolved through bilateral discussions and consultation and, ultimately, approval from ICAO, which will also involve consultation with stakeholders. So, I think it would be premature to consider any other alternatives. At this point, our focus is to bring these agreements into force, operationalise them. Because many of the questions that are being posed are hypothetical. Because we need to implement them, understand them fully and appreciate the value and the impact they have on the way we manage collectively air navigation services. Then, that will inform future decisions."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00355,2022-02-14-T-011,355,S Iswaran,"On the maps itself, I think this is something that will have to be through bilateral consultation, the decision. At this point, we are not releasing the maps."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00356,2022-02-14-T-011,356,Speaker,Ms Poh Li San.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00357,2022-02-14-T-011,357,Poh Li San,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a question for the Minister for Transport. Specific to the arrangement of the delegation of the FIR, may I know what are the benefits direct to Singapore?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00358,2022-02-14-T-011,358,S Iswaran,"If I may paraphrase the Member's question so that I get it clearly, it is really, specifically, how this benefits Changi Airport and Singapore, is that right?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00359,2022-02-14-T-011,359,Poh Li San,"That is right, Minister."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00360,2022-02-14-T-011,360,S Iswaran,"So, as I have said, there is a broader value that this agreement brings for the international civil aviation. Without that assurance, it is really difficult to contemplate how we can move forward for Changi Airport and Singapore, because, ultimately, we are an international aviation hub and, central to that, is our ability to ensure the aircraft landings and take-offs in Changi Airport can be done safely and efficiently. I would say that this is not a unique consideration for Singapore. All airports around the world, especially major aviation hubs, will take this into account, and, in fact, it is central. It would also be the case for Indonesia and its airports. So, whilst we are talking and focusing on Changi Airport, in particular, and our needs, I want to emphasise that this actually brings benefits for all parties, including Indonesian airports."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00361,2022-02-14-T-011,361,S Iswaran,"So, specifically for us, what it means is, with that assurance, we can now focus on also a range of other initiatives which will help to enhance the services that we can provide in terms of air navigation but also others to support the broader aviation sector in Singapore. It also means that in our discussions with aviation sector stakeholders, including potential investors and companies which want to set up operations here, we are now able to give them greater clarity on the matter and we can move forward on that basis. We are, as the Member by virtue of her background would be aware, looking also at various investments in technology and so on, which will enable us to enhance the quality of services that we can provide from Changi Airport. This, again, is going to be an important part of the work going forward."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00362,2022-02-14-T-011,362,S Iswaran,"So, if I may go back to what I said in response to an earlier question, whilst the details will evolve as we see the situation developing, the key thing is that this agreement, at its foundation, gives us the clarity, certainty and confidence to move forward on many issues, not just in the interest of Changi Airport, but also in our bilateral interests in terms of aviation cooperation and how we can better serve the international aviation community as air travel grows in Asia."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00363,2022-02-14-T-011,363,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00364,2022-02-14-T-011,364,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank Senior Minister Teo Che Hean and the Minister for Transport for the Ministerial Statements and I think it is useful also to say thanks to the officers of the various agencies and Ministries for making this agreement a possibility between both Singapore and Indonesia. I have two supplementary questions."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00365,2022-02-14-T-011,365,Saktiandi Supaat,"The first is in relation to what the Minister answered just now broadly. In terms of the FIR Agreement, how does it essentially improve bilateral transport cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia, particularly bilateral aviation ties, which Minister has mentioned, but going forward beyond airports?"
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00366,2022-02-14-T-011,366,Saktiandi Supaat,"My second clarification is with regard to this agreement. It definitely provides a good opportunity for both Singapore and Indonesia to work together better within the 25 years and I think also beyond the 25 years. My clarification is on how we can actually see this as a positive outlook as we look forward in the post-25 year phase as technology changes and, particularly, in the area of air traffic control safety for both countries, Singapore and Indonesia."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00367,2022-02-14-T-011,367,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his words of appreciation for the various officials who have been engaged in, as Senior Minister Teo described, extensive and intensive discussions on this very important matter and it has been a multi-agency effort involving many Ministries, the Attorney-General's Chambers, and I think it is important that this House puts on record our deep appreciation for their signal contributions to this outcome."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00368,2022-02-14-T-011,368,S Iswaran,"Secondly, as I respond to the Member's question on bilateral ties, I am reminded of today's date and its significance for bilateral relations. I think in that spirit, it is important that we see this as an opportunity to build strong, durable and mutually beneficial ties between Indonesia and Singapore. Of course, specifically, in the context of aviation, because we are talking about the FIR Agreement here, but really as a foundation for doing more together."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00369,2022-02-14-T-011,369,S Iswaran,"So, what it means is understanding – and, in fact, I made this point in my Ministerial Statement. One of the reasons we were able to get to this outcome is because both sides had a shared commitment to ensuring the safety and efficiency of international civil aviation. I think that is key because it means we understand that this is the paramount objective."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00370,2022-02-14-T-011,370,S Iswaran,"Then we have our respective interests that we need to then reconcile. That is what this process has been about. It has been a consultative process, there have been discussions over an extended period and we have now arrived at an outcome that we believe is good for Indonesia, Singapore and international civil aviation."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00371,2022-02-14-T-011,371,S Iswaran,"Looking ahead, I think what it means is it allows both sides to now focus on operationalising the arrangement, getting more familiar with each other in terms of how we can cooperate further, building confidence and building trust. That is essential because, as Senior Minister Teo made it very clear, we are neighbours, and we will be neighbours well beyond 25 years. So, it is important that at the foundation of our relationship, we have that confidence and trust. And that is the basis on which we want to go forward. So, we will be working on these various initiatives and, I might add that it is very hard to anticipate the trajectory of civil aviation over two and a half decades. A lot has happened in the last 25 years. Indeed, a lot has happened in the last five, six years and we must expect a lot more may happen in the next 25 years."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00372,2022-02-14-T-011,372,S Iswaran,"If I may just give you one example. We have the Singapore Airshow on and I met with some aviation officials this morning and one of the focal points is what in the industry they call ""network operational efficiencies"". This is really about how, between the aircraft avionics and the air navigation service provisions, we can optimise so as to minimise the impediments to smooth flows, because when you have those impediments caused by congestion, weather events and so on, it means aircraft have to circle, burn extra fuel and so on, and it takes on an even more significant hue when we consider these sorts of matters in the context of the broader climate change challenge and the kind of sustainability initiatives that we want to work on. I am just citing that as one example of how we can work together and there are many other areas. But this agreement creates the foundation upon which we can build that stronger, bilateral partnership."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00373,2022-02-14-T-011,373,Speaker,Mr Seah Kian Peng.
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00374,2022-02-14-T-011,374,Seah Kian Peng,"I just wanted to say that I think it is a great outcome for both countries and, given that it has taken us so much time to get to where we are, as the duration of the three agreements are about 25 years, I wonder whether it is possible that we could have a situation where it is an auto renewal, rather than a review followed by a renewal. I am just changing it slightly with a view that we want to secure the future for both countries and for the global community, particularly for global travel. Something for consideration."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00375,2022-02-14-T-011,375,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question and I understand fully the intent behind it. I would say we have an agreement today. It is a good agreement. I think the first and most important thing is for us to make sure they are ratified and they enter into force. And then, I think we have the time and opportunity to work on a whole slew of initiatives to foster that closer cooperation and understanding."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00376,2022-02-14-T-011,376,S Iswaran,"As I pointed out in my Ministerial Statement, there are all kinds of partnerships in the provision of air navigation services around the world. So, I would not preclude any option going forward, but the basis for ideas like what the Member has suggested, really is that it must be premised on first having a close understanding and cooperation between all the parties concerned and this must be borne out by experience that it can work to mutual benefit and accommodate the needs of both sides well."
2022-02-14-T-011-S-00377,2022-02-14-T-011,377,S Iswaran,"So, I think we need to focus on this first. I would not preclude alternative structures going forward. But neither do I want to hasten into those sorts of discussions at this point. I think, in general, from a Government point of view, what we have today is a good agreement. Agreements can always be better, but the converse can also be true. So, it is about making sure what we have works and works well for all parties. I think that would then give us the basis on which to build for the future."

2022-02-14-T-016-S-00388,2022-02-14-T-016,388,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Trade and Industry, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00389,2022-02-14-T-016,389,Low Yen Ling,The Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2022 amends the Act to provide for tax incentive changes which were introduced in Budget 2021. It also enables the Minister for Trade and Industry to assign various functions and powers to public bodies for the administration of tax incentives under the Act. Let me elaborate on the two key legislative changes contained in the Bill.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00390,2022-02-14-T-016,390,Low Yen Ling,"The enhancement of the ""Investment Allowance for Energy Efficiency"" scheme, which is now renamed ""Investment Allowance for Emissions Reduction"" (""IA-ER""), was announced at Budget 2021. The scheme currently supports companies in improving their energy efficiency. This Bill expands the scope of support to also include investments in equipment that result in measurable and verifiable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00391,2022-02-14-T-016,391,Low Yen Ling,"Specifically, the IA-ER grants a tax allowance on the qualifying fixed capital expenditure incurred within the qualifying period, which can be used to offset the company's taxable income. The scheme's validity period has also been extended from 31 March 2021 to 31 December 2026, to support companies adapting and transiting to a low-carbon economy. This proposed change is in response to industry feedback on how such investment allowances will help them reduce their carbon footprint, especially for manufacturing companies and data centre operators. To give legislative effect to these changes, clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill amend sections 41 and 43 of the Act respectively."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00392,2022-02-14-T-016,392,Low Yen Ling,"The second change concerns the internal administration of tax incentives. Clause 2 of the Bill inserts a new section 3A into the Act, which allows the Minister for Trade and Industry to assign to public bodies various functions and powers of the administration of tax incentives under the Act. This amendment arises from our periodic review of the income tax system to improve tax administration and is aligned with the Income Tax Act. There is no change in policy intent and no impact on tax incentive recipients. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00393,2022-02-14-T-016,393,Low Yen Ling,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00394,2022-02-14-T-016,394,Don Wee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the amendment to expand the scope for the Investment Allowance for Energy Efficiency (IA-EE) tax incentive scheme to include projects which reduce greenhouse gas emissions with effect from 1 April 2021 and to extend the validity period of the scheme from 31 March 2021 to 31 December 2026."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00395,2022-02-14-T-016,395,Don Wee,"Instead of granting approval to a company in respect of a project for improving energy efficiency for just this period, would the Ministry consider extending it to 31 December 2030, so as to be aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030? How will the Government direct its R&D funding to achieve Singapore Green Plan outcomes? High upfront capital costs, long pay-back periods and the uncertainty of long-term investments are major challenges facing companies, especially SMEs, seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This amendment will definitely help reduce the barriers and encourage more green investments. I hope that in the upcoming Budget, there will be more such incentives announced, so that we can look forward to another set of similar amendments a year from now."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00396,2022-02-14-T-016,396,Don Wee,"I am certain that the resultant investments will contribute to Singapore's economy, advance our capabilities and create good jobs for Singaporeans. I appeal for additional support for SMEs to develop their sustainability capabilities and improve their energy efficiency, for example, ESG's Enterprise Sustainability Programme and NEA's Energy Efficiency Technology Centre. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00397,2022-02-14-T-016,397,Don Wee,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] We need new incentives for both pioneer industries and pioneer service firms to provide investors more certainty of a long-term tax incentive in Singapore so that we boost energy efficiency and also achieve our ""30 by 30"" goal."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00398,2022-02-14-T-016,398,Don Wee,"I also urge the Government to provide greater certainty for investments on space use, which is particularly necessary to catalyse the transformation of our urban farming and aquaculture sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of global trade. We cannot be dependent on other countries' policies and export limitations, particularly for essentials such as food. With this imminent urgency, it is our inescapable duty to every generation of our people to increase our local production ─ it is a heavy responsibility for the long haul. How is the Government helping our industries to build up capabilities and capacities to achieve the ""30 by 30"" goal?"
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00399,2022-02-14-T-016,399,Don Wee,(In English)  I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00400,2022-02-14-T-016,400,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, the proposed amendments to the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act currently tabled are almost entirely of an operational nature. The bulk of the amendments concerns two elements  clause 2 inserts a new section that will allow the Minister to vest, unto a public body, functions or powers afforded by the Act to the Minister. Clauses 3 and 4, then introduce new definitions of greenhouse gas into the Act's tax incentive schemes, which aligns with this Government's Green Plan as well as the amendments to the Environmental Protection and Management Act, passed last year in this House."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00401,2022-02-14-T-016,401,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I do not oppose the Bill, but I will offer two additional points for consideration, consistent with both of these primary modifications. The Workers' Party sees little that is objectionable to providing stronger incentives to businesses for incorporating emissions-reducing projects into their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, in my speech for the Motion on Transition to a Low Carbon Society last month, I had suggested that Government agencies should look for opportunities to weave green elements into their capital expenditure projects. Providing analogous tax breaks for the private sector when they do so is entirely consistent with such a whole-of-society effort to address the climate emergency and I am heartened that such efforts are being weaved into our existing legislation."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00402,2022-02-14-T-016,402,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But if I may say, we should not only look at the tax instrument to effect favourable shifts in corporate behaviour. Subsidies must surely play a part too. And the effects of such positive incentives are even further amplified when they are simultaneously financed by taxes to discourage emissions-generating activity."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00403,2022-02-14-T-016,403,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In their contributions to the Motion last month, my friends in this House spoke about various ways subsidies can be applied to enhance both the economic and political palatability of the green transition. The Member for Aljunied, Mr Gerald Giam, spoke about putting in place incentives for households to install solar generation capacity in their private homes by subsidising such installation before recovering the cost of the subsidies from the excess electricity produced by these homes. In a similar spirit, the Member for Hougang, Mr Dennis Tan, reiterated how carbon taxes could be channelled to ensure a just transition, especially among lower-income households and workers who may be displaced by moves toward a more environmentally sustainable economy."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00404,2022-02-14-T-016,404,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In the context of moving beyond tax breaks, I, therefore, wish to ask how the Government plans to continue its financing of economic incentives for firms that adopt environmentally sustainable initiatives. Would these follow the model for existing programmes, such as NEA's Energy Efficiency Fund or BCA's Green Mark Incentive Scheme, via Budget line items, or will there be a more dedicated development fund that is established for this purpose?"
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00405,2022-02-14-T-016,405,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, the second point I wish to touch on is how delegation could give rise to a loss of ownership and responsibility. More specifically, the danger I perceive is that after roles are transferred, the sense of responsibility unforturnately fails to follow. This gives rise to the risk – common even among large private-sector organisations – and what this means for public agencies and functionaries could be a loss of ownership and control."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00406,2022-02-14-T-016,406,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Of course, I understand that the Minister retains full and final de jure responsibility over any vested powers. Even so, as humans, it is often easy, too easy perhaps, for this buck to be passed. The last thing we want is a situation where one party appeals to the so-called Richard Nixon defence, where they did not do anything, since it was executed by an underling and they were unaware, while the other claims the Nuremberg defence, famously presented by Adolf Eichmann and his collaborators in justifying their actions during World War II, which is that they were ordered and they did not have any agency in the matter."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00407,2022-02-14-T-016,407,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Moreover, it would not surprise anyone in this House that politicians and bureaucrats are held accountable in a different manner  the former by voters during election time and the latter by their peers and colleagues or the public at large. As a consequence, the two face rather different incentives. Politicians are often motivated by the service to the voters that they represent, which in turn influence their re-election prospects. Bureaucrats, in contrast, are guided more by careerist ambitions; if they excel, they can improve their chances for professional advancement, or prospects in the private sector after they exit the Public Service."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00408,2022-02-14-T-016,408,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This divergence between accountability structures and, in turn, behavioural outcomes, means that policy may actually be more optimally executed by one group or the other, depending on the nature of the task at hand. In particular, research has suggested that complex tasks – premised on ability rather than effort – are better performed when delegated to bureaucrats. Politicians, conversely, are preferable if flexibility over our understanding of society's preferences is important, and this is especially so when there is a need to compensate potential losers arising from any associated policy reform."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00409,2022-02-14-T-016,409,Jamus Jerome Lim,Let me put this into more concrete terms using two examples.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00410,2022-02-14-T-016,410,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The first has to do with monetary policy, which is rather topical, in light of our nation's recent challenges with high inflation. The simple framework I have described suggests that the inflation target – say, keeping core inflation just under 2% per annum – should be chosen by politicians, while the more technically challenging task of choosing the appropriate interest rate, size of balance sheet and the specific exchange rate level would fall under the ambit of our central bankers within the Monetary Authority of Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00411,2022-02-14-T-016,411,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As another example, consider efforts to address income and wealth inequality. Here, my argument is that it should fall on elected representatives to determine how much inequality society can tolerate, which redistributive goals would be fair and just, and what types of taxes we should accommodate. The technicalities of getting us there – adjusting specific marginal tax rates, executing efficient expenditures and ensuring a balanced budget – these should then fall back into the laps of professionals in MOF."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00412,2022-02-14-T-016,412,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Turning back to the Bill in question, I am left to wonder whether there are specific conditions that should be fulfilled, such as when the matter is explicitly technical in nature and when normative decision-making would not be asked for or required before the Minister would then allow for such delegation. And what mechanisms are there in place to ensure that both de facto as well as de jure ownership of decisions remain with the respective Minister?"
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00413,2022-02-14-T-016,413,Speaker,Minister of State Low Yen Ling.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00414,2022-02-14-T-016,414,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the two Members, Mr Don Wee and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, for their support of the Bill and also for the opportunity to make some clarifications."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00415,2022-02-14-T-016,415,Low Yen Ling,"During Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's remarks, he alluded to the question about the amendments. Allow me to clarify that these amendments would affect the applications for the investment allowance for emission reductions (IA-ER) that are received between 1 April 2021 and the time that the legislative amendments are passed."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00416,2022-02-14-T-016,416,Low Yen Ling,"I want to assure the two Members that MTI, MOF and the agencies routinely review the effectiveness of our incentives to make necessary adjustments, such as extending the validity of the scheme or to adjust the scheme parameters. These are typically announced by the Minister for Finance at Budget, following which, agencies would then work with AGC to draft the legislative amendments."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00417,2022-02-14-T-016,417,Low Yen Ling,"Incentive applications during the intervening period may be awarded retrospectively if the legislative amendments are backdated to the announced start date. In this instance, the amendments are being backdated to 1 April 2021, which was the previously announced start date of the IA-ER."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00418,2022-02-14-T-016,418,Low Yen Ling,"With the expanded scope of the IA-ER and the increased attention that companies are placing on their own carbon footprint, we expect great interest in the scheme going forward."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00419,2022-02-14-T-016,419,Low Yen Ling,Mr Don Wee spoke passionately in English and Mandarin about whether the IA-ER scheme could be extended to 2030 to align with the Singapore Green Plan 2030. He also asked how the incentives could further help our SMEs or businesses fulfil the aims of Singapore Green Plan 2030 and whether additional support could be provided.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00420,2022-02-14-T-016,420,Low Yen Ling,"Allow me to assure Mr Don Wee and also Assoc Prof Jamus Lim that the IA-ER is part of a comprehensive suite of measures to support our industries and our companies based in Singapore in their decarbonisation journey and also to better position themselves to seize the opportunities in the green economy. Other incentives and schemes include ─ and I think some Members would have read about it, but allow me to recap ─ the Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy, the Energy Efficiency Fund, the $180 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP) that was mentioned by Mr Don Wee, launched by ESG on 1 October last year, and the Low-carbon Energy Research Funding initiative."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00421,2022-02-14-T-016,421,Low Yen Ling,"Like I have mentioned, many of these programmes have been recently launched. MTI, ESG, and not just within the MTI family, I want to assure the two Members that we are taking a whole-of-Government approach. We will work with the various Ministries, including MSE, MOF and so on, and the relevant agencies to monitor their progress and review them regularly to ensure that, collectively, they remain relevant and effective in supporting our industries, our companies' decarbonisation journey and also Singapore's climate goals."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00422,2022-02-14-T-016,422,Low Yen Ling,We will similarly review the IA-ER scheme at an appropriate juncture to determine whether to extend it further or to adjust the scheme's parameters.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00423,2022-02-14-T-016,423,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Don Wee also asked in his remarks how the Government is helping our industries to build their capabilities to meet our ""30 by 30"" goal. And Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, in his earlier remarks, recapped a list of recommendations and proposals, including those to encourage households to reduce their carbon footprint. Allow me to share with both Members that MSE will provide an update at next month's Committee of Supply debate."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00424,2022-02-14-T-016,424,Low Yen Ling,"I believe Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also asked about the introduction of the new section 3A of the Bill that allows the Minister for Trade and Industry to assign to public bodies various functions and powers of the administration of tax incentives under the Act. I want to assure Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and every Member in this House that when we talk about the public bodies, as far as this Bill is concerned, it refers to Government agencies, such as EDB and ESG. These two are the economic agencies within the entire family charged with the mandate to incur key investment promotions in Singapore and to support SMEs' development. So, these bodies refer to both EDB and ESG which administer economic expansion-related tax incentives."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00425,2022-02-14-T-016,425,Low Yen Ling,I want to assure Assoc Prof Jamus Lim that MTI also shares his wish to make sure that we remain pro-business when administering the tax incentive and that is really why we are introducing this amendment which would then provide EDB and ESG with more autonomy and agility to anchor key business investments and projects expediently. This is also in line with the existing practice where public bodies administer tax incentives via delegation made under the Interpretation Act.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00426,2022-02-14-T-016,426,Low Yen Ling,I want to thank Mr Don Wee and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim for their questions and also support.
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00427,2022-02-14-T-016,427,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is committed to fostering a business-friendly environment in Singapore. We will continue to review and sharpen our tools to help our businesses move towards a low-carbon future and we look forward to the continued support of this House in that endeavour."
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00428,2022-02-14-T-016,428,Low Yen Ling,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2022-02-14-T-016-S-00429,2022-02-14-T-016,429,Low Yen Ling,[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. (proc text)]

2022-02-14-T-016-S-00431,2022-02-14-T-016,431,Low Yen Ling,[(proc text) Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. (proc text)]
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00432,2022-02-14-T-017,432,Speaker,Minister for Transport.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00433,2022-02-14-T-017,433,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Transport, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00434,2022-02-14-T-017,434,Baey Yam Keng,"The threat of terrorism to Singapore remains high. According to MHA, global terrorist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda, remain resilient and adaptable, despite losing key leaders and strongholds in recent years. The complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 may also facilitate the resurgence of Al-Qaeda and ISIS-Khorasan using it as a safe haven."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00435,2022-02-14-T-017,435,Baey Yam Keng,"Terrorists continue to pose a real threat to civil aviation. In December 2020, a Kenyan member of Al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda's East African affiliate, was charged in the US for plotting to conduct a 9/11-style attack in an unnamed US city. More recently, the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, an entity affiliated with Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da'esh) claimed responsibility for the attacks near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on 27 August 2021, which resulted in the death and injuries of dozens of civilians, including children. Just less than a month ago, on 17 January 2022, terrorist attacks left three dead and others injured near Abu Dhabi International Airport. On 1 February 2022, the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization deplored the targeting of civil aviation infrastructure, in flagrant violation of international law and the ongoing threat to international peace and security caused by these terrorist acts."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00436,2022-02-14-T-017,436,Baey Yam Keng,"In our ongoing efforts to further strengthen our defence against such terrorist attacks, especially against civil aviation corporations, we intend to accede to two international aviation security treaties  the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation, also known as the Beijing Convention 2010, and the Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, also known as the Beijing Protocol 2010."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00437,2022-02-14-T-017,437,Baey Yam Keng,"The reasons are as follows  one, the threat of terrorism to Singapore remains high. Due to the cross-border nature of the threat, international cooperation is necessary to combat such threats; two, the Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 will strengthen Singapore's ability to deal with terrorism-related threats to the safety and security of civil aviation; three, the two Beijing treaties will enable us to better protect Singaporeans, by providing a clear basis for us to exercise our criminal jurisdiction as provided for under the two treaties; and four, the Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 will also facilitate the extradition of offenders and provision of mutual legal assistance. This would enhance Singapore's capabilities to carry out enforcement actions against offenders who have committed acts that threaten Singapore and Singaporeans locally and abroad."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00438,2022-02-14-T-017,438,Baey Yam Keng,"The two Beijing treaties modernise the legal framework for aviation security, targeting unlawful seizure of aircraft and unlawful interference against civil aviation. They require state parties to criminalise a number of acts which have emerged as threats to the safety and security of civil aviation, including those manifested in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 when civil aircraft were used as weapons of mass destruction."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00439,2022-02-14-T-017,439,Baey Yam Keng,"The Beijing Convention modernises and consolidates two earlier aviation security treaties, namely, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, also known as the Montreal Convention 1971, and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, also known as the Montreal Protocol 1988."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00440,2022-02-14-T-017,440,Baey Yam Keng,"The Montreal Convention 1971 criminalises certain acts of violence against aircraft, including persons therein, or air navigation facilities, while the Montreal Protocol 1988 supplemented the Montreal Convention 1971 to criminalise certain acts of violence against an international airport, including persons therein."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00441,2022-02-14-T-017,441,Baey Yam Keng,"In addition to those already criminalised under the two Montreal treaties, the Beijing Convention criminalises the following acts  one, using an aircraft for the purpose of causing death, serious bodily injury or serious damage; two, releasing or discharging from an aircraft, or using on board or against aircraft any biological, chemical or nuclear (BCN) weapons or explosive, radioactive or similar substances; three, transporting, causing to be transported, or facilitating the transport of BCN weapons or explosive, radioactive or similar substances, and so on, on board an aircraft; and four, cyber attacks on air navigation facilities."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00442,2022-02-14-T-017,442,Baey Yam Keng,"The Beijing Protocol 2010 supplements the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, also known as the Hague Convention 1970. The Hague Convention 1970 criminalises acts relating to unlawful seizure of aircraft, while the Beijing Protocol 2010 expands the scope of the offences in that Convention to cover additional forms of unlawful seizure of aircraft, including through modern technological means."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00443,2022-02-14-T-017,443,Baey Yam Keng,"Both the Beijing treaties make it an offence to make a threat or unlawfully cause someone to receive a threat to commit offences under circumstances which indicate that the threat is credible. Both treaties also provide for the criminal liability of other persons, such as accomplices, the directors and organisers of an offence, persons who knowingly assist an offender to evade investigation, prosecution or punishment, and persons who contribute or agree to contribute to an offence. Both treaties further provide the option for Contracting States to provide under their domestic laws for the liability of legal entities where a person responsible for its management or control commits a relevant offence."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00444,2022-02-14-T-017,444,Baey Yam Keng,"Similar to its predecessor instruments, the Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 facilitate the extradition of offenders and provision of mutual legal assistance. For example, the treaties provide that state parties shall, subject to the laws of the requested state, afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of the offences under the treaties. The Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 additionally provide that a request for extradition or mutual legal assistance based on an offence under the treaties may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence, or an offence connected with a political offence, or an offence inspired by political motives."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00445,2022-02-14-T-017,445,Baey Yam Keng,"By expanding the scope of offences and grounds of jurisdiction and removing a ground for refusal for extradition and mutual legal assistance, the Beijing treaties strengthen state parties' capacity to deter these offences under civil aviation, and to prosecute and punish those who commit them."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00446,2022-02-14-T-017,446,Baey Yam Keng,"Singapore is a party to and has ratified the earlier treaties, namely, the Montreal Convention 1971 on 12 April 1978, the Montreal Protocol 1988 on 22 December 1996 and the Hague Convention 1970 on 12 April 1978. The Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 entered into force on 1 July 2018 and 1 January 2018 respectively, for those states that are party to it. Singapore intends to accede to the Beijing treaties, for the reasons I have explained earlier."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00447,2022-02-14-T-017,447,Baey Yam Keng,The Hijacking of Aircraft and Protection of Aircraft and International Airports (Amendment) Bill will give effect to the Beijing treaties and facilitate Singapore's implementation of the obligations under these treaties when we accede to them.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00448,2022-02-14-T-017,448,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now highlight the key provisions of the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00449,2022-02-14-T-017,449,Baey Yam Keng,"Clause 4 amends section 3(1) which relates to the offence of hijacking. Before the amendment, the offence of hijacking can only be committed in relation to an aircraft in flight. With the amendment, the offence of hijacking can also be committed in relation to an aircraft in service. This will include the duration of the pre-flight preparation of the aircraft by ground personnel or by the crew for a specific flight until 24 hours after any landing, in addition to the period when the aircraft is in flight. The amendment further expands the scope of the offence of hijacking to include the unlawful seizure of an aircraft using any technological means."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00450,2022-02-14-T-017,450,Baey Yam Keng,"Clauses 6, 8(d) and 9 also amend the Act such that certain provisions of the Act do not apply to any act committed in relation to an aircraft used in military, customs or Police service unless  one, the act is committed in or over Singapore; two, where the act is committed outside Singapore, but the person committing the act is a citizen of Singapore; or three, the aircraft is used in the military, customs or Police service of the Republic of Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00451,2022-02-14-T-017,451,Baey Yam Keng,"Clause 7 inserts new offences sections 5A to 5D. These provisions address new categories of acts that have emerged over the past two decades as potential threats to the safe operation of, or the safety of persons in an aircraft, an aerodrome or an aerodrome facility. These include the events of 9/11, where aircraft were hijacked and used as weapons for terrorist attacks, and as mentioned earlier, just last month on 17 January where there was an attack near the Abu Dhabi International Airport."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00452,2022-02-14-T-017,452,Baey Yam Keng,"The new section 5A criminalises the use of an aircraft in service for the purpose of causing death, serious bodily injury, or serious damage to property or the environment."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00453,2022-02-14-T-017,453,Baey Yam Keng,"The new section 5B criminalises the release or discharge from an aircraft in service any BCN weapon, or any explosive, radioactive or similar substances, in a manner that causes or is likely to cause death, serious bodily injury or serious damage to property or the environment."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00454,2022-02-14-T-017,454,Baey Yam Keng,"The new section 5C criminalises the use against or on board any aircraft in service any BCN weapon, or any explosive, radioactive or similar substances, in a manner that causes or is likely to cause death, serious bodily injury or serious damage to property or the environment."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00455,2022-02-14-T-017,455,Baey Yam Keng,"The new section 5D criminalises the transport of, causing to be transported, or facilitating the transport of, certain proscribed items on board an aircraft. Examples of these proscribed items include any explosive or radioactive material, any BCN weapon and any source material or special fissionable material."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00456,2022-02-14-T-017,456,Baey Yam Keng,"The new sections 5A to 5D apply regardless of whether any act constituting the offence under any of those sections is committed in Singapore or elsewhere, whatever the nationality or citizenship of the person committing the act or whatever the state in which the aircraft is registered."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00457,2022-02-14-T-017,457,Baey Yam Keng,"Similar to the new sections 5A to 5D, clause 8 amends section 6 on ""Other acts endangering or likely to endanger safety of aircraft"". The amended section will apply regardless of whether any act constituting the offence is committed in Singapore or elsewhere, whatever the nationality or citizenship of the persons committing the act or whatever the state in which the aircraft is registered."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00458,2022-02-14-T-017,458,Baey Yam Keng,Clause 10 repeals section 8 and substitutes a new section 8.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00459,2022-02-14-T-017,459,Baey Yam Keng,"The new section 8(1) makes it an offence for any person who makes a threat to commit certain offences, or unlawfully and intentionally causes any person to receive such a threat, under circumstances which indicate the threat to be credible. The new section 8(2) makes it an offence for a person A to unlawfully and intentionally assist any other person B to evade investigation, prosecution or punishment, when A knows that B has committed certain acts, or is wanted for any criminal prosecution, or is sentenced for certain offences."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00460,2022-02-14-T-017,460,Baey Yam Keng,Clause 11 repeals and re-enacts section 9 and inserts new section 9A and 9B.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00461,2022-02-14-T-017,461,Baey Yam Keng,The new section 9 stipulates the penalties for the various offences under the Act.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00462,2022-02-14-T-017,462,Baey Yam Keng,"The new sections 9A and 9B deal with offences committed by corporations, unincorporated associations or partnerships and also attribute criminal liability to certain officers of such corporations, unincorporated associations or partnerships."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00463,2022-02-14-T-017,463,Baey Yam Keng,"Clause 12 repeals and re-enacts section 11 and inserts a new section 12. The new section 11 to extend the provisions relating to extradition under the Act and the Extradition Act to the new offences inserted by the Bill, and provides that the Beijing treaties and their predecessor treaties may be used as the legal basis for extradition in the absence of an extradition treaty."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00464,2022-02-14-T-017,464,Baey Yam Keng,"The new section 12 provides that in the provision of mutual legal assistance to any state which is a party to the Convention for a criminal matter involving an offence in that state corresponding to a relevant offence, that offence in the state will be deemed not to be an offence of a political character. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00465,2022-02-14-T-017,465,Baey Yam Keng,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00466,2022-02-14-T-017,466,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00467,2022-02-14-T-017,467,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, this Bill gives effects to Singapore's obligations under the Beijing Convention."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00468,2022-02-14-T-017,468,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The Bill proposes to criminalise certain dangerous actions relating to aviation, including the use of aircraft as a weapon. Even in this time of reduced air travel, it is a necessary update to our law and helps enhance aviation safety. With the passage of this Bill, Singapore is once again standing with the international community and showing its commitment to the international rule of law."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00469,2022-02-14-T-017,469,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have just two short clarifications on how we can help the airline industry comply with the requirements under this Bill.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00470,2022-02-14-T-017,470,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My first point has to do with the technical guidance to assist compliance by the airline industry. The Bill introduces offences relating to the transport of certain dangerous materials and BCN weapons.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00471,2022-02-14-T-017,471,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Airlines routinely transport dangerous goods. This is why the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has in place Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. When drafting the Beijing Convention, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) had proposed to deem an airline carrier as compliant with the Beijing Convention as long as they can show compliance with the Technical Instructions. This was not accepted by the delegates at the Beijing Diplomatic Conference where the Beijing Convention was drafted."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00472,2022-02-14-T-017,472,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Nevertheless, to provide guidance to airlines in navigating the implementation of this Bill, can the Minister share if and how the ICAO's Technical Instructions should be considered by the Courts in Singapore in the interpretation of this Bill?"
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00473,2022-02-14-T-017,473,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second point is on support extended to the airlines to ensure compliance with the provisions in this Bill. This Bill tackles serious crimes and exposes airlines to significant criminal liability. Can Minister share if the Government has worked with the airline industry to ensure proper review of their cargo processes so that airlines do not inadvertently expose themselves to criminal liability under the Bill?
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00474,2022-02-14-T-017,474,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00475,2022-02-14-T-017,475,Poh Li San,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as an executive staff with the Changi Airport Group."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00476,2022-02-14-T-017,476,Poh Li San,"Please allow me to recount a chilling event that could have gone horribly wrong during the early days of Changi Airport. On 26 March 1991, Singapore Airlines Flight 117 was hijacked. There were 114 passengers and 11 crew on board. The plane was hijacked mid-air while enroute from Subang, Malaysia, to Singapore Changi Airport, by four Pakistani terrorists who were armed with explosives and knives."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00477,2022-02-14-T-017,477,Poh Li San,"Eight and a half gruelling hours after the hijacked plane landed at Changi Airport, the hijackers gave a last five-minute deadline for their demands. They issued a threat to kill one passenger every 10 minutes if their demands were not met. With three minutes to go, the SAF Commandos stormed the plane and within just 30 seconds, killed all four hijackers, with no injuries to hostages. The commandos not only secured the plane, rescued all 125 people on board but also safeguarded the future of our Changi airhub."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00478,2022-02-14-T-017,478,Poh Li San,"It has been 31 years since that first and only hijacking of a Singapore aircraft. The rescue operation was testament to our capabilities to keep Changi Airport safe and secure. As a global aviation hub, a core fundamental for success is the ability to maintain the highest level of security at all times, so as to deter potential perpetrators and facilitate the smooth and secure running of daily operations. To do so, we not only need stringent aviation security processes, valiant and capable security forces but also effective international aviation law and cooperation with other countries."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00479,2022-02-14-T-017,479,Poh Li San,"Ten years after SQ 117, in 2001, the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States happened. The terrorists had used the aircraft itself as weapon of mass destruction. It was the single and most destructive event that had changed the nature and future of air travel permanently."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00480,2022-02-14-T-017,480,Poh Li San,"Indeed, over the years, the tools deployed by terrorists and hijackers have become even more destructive, sophisticated and harder to detect. Our security forces will have to stay abreast of the latest developments happening on the dark side, gather intelligence on a global network and ensure that security measures are updated and tightly-enforced. We will also need to work with other nations due to the cross-border nature of such threats. This is why it is so important for us to support this Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00481,2022-02-14-T-017,481,Poh Li San,"The Hijacking of Aircraft and Protection of Aircraft and International Airports Amendment Bill will pave the way for Singapore's accession to the Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010. In summary, the Convention criminalises the use of civil aircraft as a weapon and the illegal transport or discharge of dangerous materials, including explosive, radioactive, biological, chemical or nuclear (BCN) weapons to attack aircraft or other targets."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00482,2022-02-14-T-017,482,Poh Li San,"In addition, provisions for extradition among Convention and Protocol partners will be useful in the event of the absence of extradition treaties between affected countries for the listed offences. Take for example, the terrorist attack on Korean Airlines Flight 858 in 1987. The perpetrator, Kim Hyon Hui, a North Korean spy, was caught and extradited from Bahrain to Seoul for trial, for planting the bomb which killed 115 people on that flight. Such cases can potentially involve multiple jurisdictions."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00483,2022-02-14-T-017,483,Poh Li San,"Hence, as a leading international air hub, Singapore will need to ensure that in the worst-case scenario of a terrorist attack, we have done all we can to be able to extradite perpetrators from most parts of the world, so that they can be tried for their crimes and to be meted punishments, and the criminal trial and punishment may also provide a form of closure for the families of the victims."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00484,2022-02-14-T-017,484,Poh Li San,"Mr Speaker, Sir, given the importance of this Bill, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister for Transport."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00485,2022-02-14-T-017,485,Poh Li San,"Firstly, why has it taken Singapore more than a decade to accede to this treaty? From the perspective of our aviation security operations, the stated activities and listed items are already forbidden. We already have in place measures to protect the cockpit and prevent unlawful interference of an aircraft, and security screening to detect and remove prohibited items which may be used as weapons to threaten flight crews. Biological, chemical or nuclear items are already included in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) technical specifications of Dangerous Goods. Hence, accession to the treaty will not have an onerous impact on our existing ground processes."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00486,2022-02-14-T-017,486,Poh Li San,"Second, I would like to ask how many other countries are signatories to the Convention and Protocol. Also, how do these numbers compare to the other three international agreements relevant to aircraft hijacking, namely, the Tokyo Convention, the Hague Convention and the Montreal Convention? What are the main reasons for the differences in response and support from the international community?"
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00487,2022-02-14-T-017,487,Poh Li San,"Finally, in the context of rescue operations of hijacked aircraft, such as in the case of SQ 117, what is the legal liability for unintended injuries or deaths inflicted on innocent hostages by our security forces? Will the security forces be subjected to legal actions too? I hope that the security forces would be accorded immunity because they are risking their own lives while neutralising terrorists, in order to save innocent passengers and crew."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00488,2022-02-14-T-017,488,Poh Li San,"Mr Speaker, Sir, terrorist threats are evolving and Singapore remains a target. Securing our civil aviation system is not just the job of the security agencies. Everyone has a part to play. We must all remain vigilant and continually strengthen our defences against threats that may undermine the safety and security of our civil aviation system."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00489,2022-02-14-T-017,489,Poh Li San,"Notwithstanding my clarifications, I support the amendment Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00490,2022-02-14-T-017,490,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to this Bill are introduced to give effect to the 2010 aviation treaty signed in Beijing. With the demand for air travel set to pick up over the next few years, this Bill is imperative. I have several queries on it."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00491,2022-02-14-T-017,491,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Bill cover all forms of technology, especially those recently developed and enhanced technology, which could be used for purposes of warfare and terrorism?"
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00492,2022-02-14-T-017,492,Yip Hon Weng,"For instance, there has been reports about the suspected use of electronic warfare and methodologies. These include microwave frequencies or directed, pulsed radio frequency energy from portable microwave weapons, to disrupt neurological function, also known as the Havana Syndrome."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00493,2022-02-14-T-017,493,Yip Hon Weng,"With experts on the subject matter suggesting the possible development of non-kinetic tools and other forms of electromagnetic pulse weapons, should we not be concerned that terrorists may discharge such components from planes? They could also use them to turn planes into weapons of destruction. Some of these technologies may not cause death or serious injury upon application. However, they could impair the judgement of pilots and aircrew or incapacitate them to the point where they are unable to maintain controlled flight. The sensitivity of electronic interference to aircraft navigation systems has been recently brought to light due to the introduction of 5G near some US airports."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00494,2022-02-14-T-017,494,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Bill consider that hackers could control an aircraft by hacking an aircraft's systems? In 2016, the US Department of Homeland Security conducted a hacking exercise. They were able to penetrate the system of a passenger plane without insider help or being on board. Today, many aspects of aviation are digitalised, from the sale of air tickets, to inflight systems, to the management of jet fuel and air traffic control. The importance of software in civil aviation is paramount. For example, seemingly minor software issues eventually led to Boeing's 737 Max crisis. The expanded cyber footprint exposes aircraft and airports to the possibility of more cyberattacks. As such, the failure to adequately address such issues may have dire consequences."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00495,2022-02-14-T-017,495,Yip Hon Weng,"According to Eurocontrol, at least 1,260 cybersecurity breaches against airlines and other aviation bodies were reported in 2020. Last year, Singapore Airlines also suffered from a data breach. While experts believe the potential for hackers to gain control of a plane through such cybersecurity breaches is low, we should not discount any weak links. All it takes is one successful attempt to endanger an entire aircraft."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00496,2022-02-14-T-017,496,Yip Hon Weng,"Thirdly, Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Bill cover all forms of aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles and drones and such development in unmanned technology? In recent years, drones have become increasingly sophisticated. Its application has become more widespread through Government, commercial and personal use. A quick Internet search reveals that poorly secured drones can be easily hacked by the layman. Drones are already in use by terror outfits for the delivery of arms, explosives and targeted attacks. They do not have to be complex or carry explosives in order to terrorise or kill. The simple act of spraying water over a group of people or nose-diving into a crowd is enough to cause fear and a potentially fatal stampede. More needs to be done in the form of stricter penalties and regulations in drone use and security measures to prevent the abuse of drones for terror-related activities."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00497,2022-02-14-T-017,497,Yip Hon Weng,"Fourthly, Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Bill also apply to the unlikely scenario that a military, customs or Police service plane is used in the commission of an offence against civil aircraft and aerodromes? I note that clause 9 amends section 7(4) by providing that subsection (2)(a)(ii) does not apply to any act committed in relation to an aircraft used in military, customs or police service, unless the aircraft is used in the military, customs or Police service of the Republic of Singapore. What is the reason for the distinction, if any? To be comprehensive, would these types of aircraft be covered in other legislation, and what would these be?"
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00498,2022-02-14-T-017,498,Yip Hon Weng,"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, how can we ensure that cross-border collaboration with other countries and collaboration between involved Ministries to enforce this Bill will be well-integrated and seamless?"
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00499,2022-02-14-T-017,499,Yip Hon Weng,"Domestically, a number of Ministries and agencies would be involved."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00500,2022-02-14-T-017,500,Yip Hon Weng,"MOT, MHA and the Cyber Security Agency deal with domestic terror issues relating to aviation, complicated by cybersecurity. MINDEF oversees our national defence and security, while MFA engages with international organisations. I am simplifying this network of relationships for the purposes of this speech. But, in reality, this cross-Ministry collaboration would be much more complex and possibly involve a greater number of agencies."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00501,2022-02-14-T-017,501,Yip Hon Weng,"Last month, Singapore and Indonesia signed a set of agreements on a number of critical bilateral issues, including the realignment of the boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region, or FIR, and the Singapore FIR. The agreement has been described to meet the civil aviation needs of both countries. It will ensure that our Changi Airport is able to operate efficiently and safely and uphold the safety and efficiency of the air traffic control in the region. International and regional cooperation is always essential to protect the safety of international air spaces and I congratulate the Prime Minister and the team for securing the new agreement. I would like to clarify whether the realigned FIR is covered under the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00502,2022-02-14-T-017,502,Yip Hon Weng,"Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister clarify what are the penalties for the newly-added offences 5A to 5D, which would see offenders using aircrafts to cause death and destruction or abetting the act of it? Section 9 of the Act lists the penalties for offences under the Act, namely, life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $1 million. Do these penalties apply if the offender was successful in their attempt and caused death and destruction? Would capital punishment be more appropriate to match the severity of the crime?"
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00503,2022-02-14-T-017,503,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the September 11 attacks were the first time we saw an aircraft turned into a weapon of mass destruction by terrorists. More than 3,000 people were killed. It sparked a war on terror, which is still ongoing. Closer to home, as what Member Poh Li San has shared, many would remember the hijacking of SQ Flight 117. The reason why I am speaking on this Bill is because, with COVID-19 turning endemic, our aviation sector will pick up again. Our neighbours in Asia are building and expanding their airports, which could pose as a serious competition to our aviation industry. Aviation is thus important to Singapore. I would further argue that our status as an aviation hub is not only essential, but existential for our survival as a country. We must ensure that our aircraft, airports and airspaces are safe, if we are to continue to be a global aviation hub."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00504,2022-02-14-T-017,504,Yip Hon Weng,"Since 9/11, the nature of terrorism has evolved rapidly. Newer aviation technologies, some which are accessible to the layman, are being deployed. Warfare is moving from the conventional to the unconventional, to non-state adversaries. The lines are being blurred. Today, domestic terrorism is well on the way to become a much bigger threat than before, as widening disparities and misinformation threaten the unity of a nation. This Bill is thus important to ensure that our laws are relevant, comprehensive and in time for the future."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00505,2022-02-14-T-017,505,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding all these queries, I support the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00506,2022-02-14-T-017,506,Speaker,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng.
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00507,2022-02-14-T-017,507,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Louis Ng, Ms Poh Li San and Mr Yip Hon Weng for their comments and support for this Bill. Let me address the points raised."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00508,2022-02-14-T-017,508,Baey Yam Keng,"The amended section 3(1) provides that ""a person who unlawfully and intentionally seizes or exercises control of an aircraft in service by the use of force or by threats of any kind, or by any technological means, commits the offence of hijacking, whatever his nationality or citizenship, whatever the state in which the aircraft is registered and whether the aircraft is in Singapore or elsewhere."""
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00509,2022-02-14-T-017,509,Baey Yam Keng,"Depending on the facts and circumstances, this provision could potentially cover acts by malicious hackers to take control of an aircraft by hacking into the aircraft systems."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00510,2022-02-14-T-017,510,Baey Yam Keng,"The broad wording of this provision also helps to ensure that the Act continues to remain relevant and keeps pace with modern technological developments, including the use of new technological means, to endanger the safety and security of aviation."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00511,2022-02-14-T-017,511,Baey Yam Keng,"I would like to provide some clarifications on the provisions of the Bill. The Bill provides for Singapore to exercise criminal jurisdiction on broad grounds and allows Singapore to prosecute offenders for various offences regardless of where the offence was committed, in line with international law. The realignment of the Flight Information Region (FIR) boundaries relates to aviation safety and efficiency of air traffic and not sovereignty. It does not affect the provisions of this Bill and, in general, is not relevant to criminal prosecution matters."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00512,2022-02-14-T-017,512,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Yip Hon Weng raised a pertinent point that the prevalence of drones and unmanned technology certainly brings about aviation safety and security concerns. The Act can apply to certain types of unlawful and intentional acts involving unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones. For example, depending on the circumstances, the flying of a drone to intentionally collide with a landing aircraft may potentially fall under the scope of section 5(1)(a) of the Act, which covers acts, regardless of the means used, which damage an aircraft so as to render it incapable of flight or as to be likely to endanger its safety in flight."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00513,2022-02-14-T-017,513,Baey Yam Keng,"MOT had consulted other agencies on the penalties mentioned in the new section 9. In relation to the penalties for the offences under new sections 5A to 5D, MOT is of the view that by benchmarking the penalties against the existing penalties in section 9 of the Act, it is commensurate with the severity of the newly introduced offences. Singapore stands ready against current and future safety and security threats to Singapore's civil aviation system. Should there be a need for a stronger deterrent effect in future, we can introduce new or amend existing legislation."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00514,2022-02-14-T-017,514,Baey Yam Keng,"I would now turn to the query regarding the applicability of the Bill to military, customs or Police aircraft. The offence creating provisions in the Bill apply to aircraft used in military, customs or Police service in certain circumstances. For example, under the amended section 3, the offence of hijacking can be applied to such aircraft if (a) the person seizing or exercising control of the aircraft is a citizen of Singapore; (b) his act is committed in or over Singapore; or (c) the aircraft is used in Singapore's military, customs or Police service. This approach balances the immunity enjoyed by the state aircraft of other countries under international law, with the need to protect Singapore and Singaporeans in certain situations. Nonetheless, the Government stands ready to detect, handle and neutralise any safety and security threats to our civil aviation system, including in relation to any aircraft used in military, customs or Police services, in accordance with domestic and international law."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00515,2022-02-14-T-017,515,Baey Yam Keng,"I would like to share with Ms Poh Li San that, as of today, 42 countries have agreed to each of these treaties. However, it will be difficult to benchmark the response of the international community towards the Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 against the earlier treaties as those had been concluded and came into force much earlier."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00516,2022-02-14-T-017,516,Baey Yam Keng,"I believe other States are also seriously considering the provisions of these treaties, just as we did, and, in due course, we should see more countries becoming party to both treaties."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00517,2022-02-14-T-017,517,Baey Yam Keng,"Ms Poh Li San has also noted that Singapore has robust existing security measures and procedures for transporting dangerous goods in place to ensure the safe and orderly operation of Singapore's aviation industry. However, these are separate matters and we have been working to ensure that we are ready to accede, including ensuring that under our domestic laws, Singapore can implement what is required when the Beijing Convention 2010 and Beijing Protocol 2010 come into force for Singapore after accession."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00518,2022-02-14-T-017,518,Baey Yam Keng,"The civil aviation industry plays a significant role in the global economy. Therefore, aviation safety and security continue to be the highest priorities for states and the global aviation community to ensure the undisrupted and reliable operations of the aviation industry. States that have ratified or acceded to the two treaties have already indicated their commitment to collaborate with like-minded states, as provided for in the treaties."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00519,2022-02-14-T-017,519,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Yip Hon Weng has queried how collaboration between the involved Ministries to enforce this Bill will be well-integrated and seamless. Indeed, working across multiple agencies, administrative boundaries and organisation priorities are challenges that public officers face daily. This is one of the key reasons why the Singapore Public Service adopted the whole-of-Government (WOG) approach to improve collaboration among officers when working on cross-agency projects. I would like to assure Mr Yip Hon Weng and the House that our public officers will work together closely with the WOG mindset to achieve the collaboration necessary to enforce this Bill."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00520,2022-02-14-T-017,520,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Louis Ng had earlier queried how the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Technical Instructions should be considered by the Courts in Singapore in the interpretation of this Bill and was concerned that airlines might inadvertently expose themselves to criminal liability under this Bill. Similarly, Ms Poh Li San also expressed concern that our security forces may be subject to legal actions should there be unintended injuries or deaths to innocent parties during their operations. Let me address both concerns."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00521,2022-02-14-T-017,521,Baey Yam Keng,"The Technical Instructions are published by ICAO to ensure that dangerous materials are subjected to the necessary acceptance, packaging, documentation and loading processes for safe transport by air. We have to keep in mind that the Act, as amended by the Bill, is intended to address the separate matter of unlawful acts which intentionally endanger aviation safety. Therefore, the Technical Instructions are not, in themselves, relevant for the purposes of assessing such criminal liability."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00522,2022-02-14-T-017,522,Baey Yam Keng,Singapore also implements a rigorous cargo screening regime that is compliant with international standards. Our public agencies work closely with the industry stakeholders to ensure that the required safety and security standards are met.

2022-02-14-T-017-S-00524,2022-02-14-T-017,524,Baey Yam Keng,"Similarly, for our security forces executing high-risk rescue operations, with the intention to neutralise the threats posed by the perpetrators, the provisions of the Act, as amended by the Bill, are not relevant for assessing liabilities."
2022-02-14-T-017-S-00525,2022-02-14-T-017,525,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's security agencies have, over time, worked on the implementation of security measures to both detect and deter terror-minded individuals. With the provisions of this Bill, the effectiveness of these measures would be enhanced further through international cooperation, including allowing Singapore to prosecute such individuals once they are apprehended."

2022-02-14-T-018-S-00536,2022-02-14-T-018,536,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00537,2022-02-14-T-018,537,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This Bill proposes amendments to the Administration of Muslim Law Act, or AMLA."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00538,2022-02-14-T-018,538,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Before we go into the specific amendments of this Bill, I would like to first share with Members the context for AMLA and how it supports our Muslim community. The Administration of Muslim Law Act was put in place during the founding years of our nation so that Muslims could continue to have matters pertaining to marriage, divorce and their estates governed by Muslim law. This began during the British Administration. Even as the British brought English law to Singapore, the British Administration also allowed room for the indigenous inhabitants, the Malay/Muslims, to continue having their personal matters governed by their customs and beliefs, and AMLA continues this practice."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00539,2022-02-14-T-018,539,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In the founding years of our nation, Mr Ahmad Ibrahim, the first Attorney-General of Singapore, and leaders from the Muslim Advisory Board, the All-Malaya Muslim Missionary Society, the Mohammadiah Movement and the Singapore Religious Teachers' Association, also known as PERGAS, led the effort in establishing a central and uniting voice to represent Muslims in religious affairs."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00540,2022-02-14-T-018,540,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thus, AMLA established the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, also known as MUIS, to be the central administrative body for the Muslim community and designated the Mufti as the highest religious authority for Islam in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00541,2022-02-14-T-018,541,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Among the community, there was a strong interest in strengthening the institution of marriage and to nurture stronger families. So, AMLA also strengthened the Syariah Court (SYC) and the Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM)."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00542,2022-02-14-T-018,542,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government continues to maintain this legislative arrangement, which recognises the history and heritage of Malay/Muslims in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00543,2022-02-14-T-018,543,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"When the Bill to pass this Act was first introduced in this Parliament in August 1966, then Minister for Social Affairs, Mr Othman Wok, emphasised that the Bill did not seek to deal with substantive Muslim law itself, but its administration. Let me emphasise this again. The Bill did not seek to deal with substantive Muslim law itself, but its administration."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00544,2022-02-14-T-018,544,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Muslim law derives from Muslim religious sources and the Act does not alter this. Religious guidance and opinion come from the consensus of the asatizah community, led by MUIS, and officially issued by the Fatwa Committee. This has been so and will always be so. Where AMLA pronounces on religious matters, it serves only to codify the guidance of the ulama."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00545,2022-02-14-T-018,545,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Religious guidance is reviewed regularly and evolves to address the contemporary challenges that Muslims face.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00546,2022-02-14-T-018,546,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Similarly, the AMLA is reviewed regularly. This is to ensure that our laws reflect the prevailing and unique norms of our Singaporean Muslim community, the contemporary expression of our community's faith and address current socio-religious needs."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00547,2022-02-14-T-018,547,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, in 2008, this House amended AMLA to raise the minimum age of marriage under AMLA to 18 years of age to match the Women's Charter. At that time, the Government observed that minor marriages were 2.5 times more likely to end in divorce, and consensus was growing that those under the age of 21 were, generally, less prepared for marriage. Then Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, consulted with the community leaders and the community agreed it was important to signal that minor marriages were discouraged. Many other Muslim communities today still allow minor marriages. But we were prepared to look at the evidence, consider contemporary circumstances and adopt norms that made sense for us so that we can stay true to our values of upholding the family."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00548,2022-02-14-T-018,548,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MCCY has been working closely with MUIS, SYC, ROMM and other key Muslim stakeholders to review the AMLA."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00549,2022-02-14-T-018,549,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For this round of reviews, we seek to update the provisions governing the processes and operations of our statutory Muslim institutions, namely MUIS, SYC and ROMM."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00550,2022-02-14-T-018,550,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Broadly, the amendments seek to enable these institutions to adopt new administrative processes, including digital ones, for greater efficiency and productivity, and keep pace with broader developments in family law, which Minister of State Sun Xueling spoke about on my behalf on 12 January when MSF moved the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00551,2022-02-14-T-018,551,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,About half of the amendments seek to improve service delivery of SYC and ROMM and provide greater support to Muslim couples and families.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00552,2022-02-14-T-018,552,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Some amendments allow the SYC and ROMM to adopt digital processes so that they can better serve the community. We have been testing out some of these processes as measures to comply with the safe distancing requirements during the pandemic and we have found that they worked well. There are also other amendments that streamline the administration of Muslim marriages and divorces.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00553,2022-02-14-T-018,553,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Bill also contains amendments to enable MUIS to better administer its functions and duties to support the Muslim community. These include amendments to update provisions that are no longer relevant and amendments to enable MUIS' exercise of powers to collect fees for services rendered pursuant to its statutory functions.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00554,2022-02-14-T-018,554,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, the Bill also seeks to extend to Muslim families support that is on par with what is provided to non-Muslim families under the recently amended Women's Charter, in line with the Islamic principles that undergird Muslim families."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00555,2022-02-14-T-018,555,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,A draft of this Bill was published for public consultation from 13 August to 10 September 2021. We appreciated the broad support from the community for this Bill.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00556,2022-02-14-T-018,556,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Deputy Speaker, digitalisation is necessary if our institutions are to provide relevant and effective support to the community. This became all the more salient with COVID-19."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00557,2022-02-14-T-018,557,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"When the pandemic hit and safe distancing became imperative, the Office of the Mufti issued a religious opinion that the use of live video-link technology to facilitate marriage solemnisations was compatible with Muslim religious law and, thus, to keep everyone safe, ROMM adopted the video-link technology to allow marriage solemnisations to continue."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00558,2022-02-14-T-018,558,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Similarly, the SYC adapted its Court processes to allow litigants and witnesses to give evidence through approved channels of live video or live telecommunication links, to minimise disruption to divorce proceedings."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00559,2022-02-14-T-018,559,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The pandemic necessitated new norms and habits we did not consider prior to 2020. We have learnt the importance of leveraging technology for contingencies so that we can minimise disruptions to service delivery. Thus, this Bill contains amendments that will give SYC, an Appeal Board and ROMM permanent powers to conduct proceedings via remote communication technology in appropriate situations. The amendments do not replace the traditional mode of physical proceedings but enable SYC, an Appeal Board and ROMM to adopt digital alternative modes of conducting proceedings, if the situation calls for it. This is covered by clauses 3, 6, 14, 15, 22 and 23."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00560,2022-02-14-T-018,560,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Bill also seeks to improve the service experience of Court users. It will provide the legal framework to empower SYC to adopt new IT systems and digital processes, which will improve case management and communication with litigants and their lawyers."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00561,2022-02-14-T-018,561,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Beyond digitalisation, this Bill also seeks to improve legal processes and address past provisions that have inadvertently caused hardship to litigants."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00562,2022-02-14-T-018,562,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Clause 11 seeks to amend section 50 of AMLA, which governs divorce proceedings conducted by hakam."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00563,2022-02-14-T-018,563,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The role of a set of hakam is to guide a Muslim couple towards reconciliation and, if it that is not possible, towards an amicable parting."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00564,2022-02-14-T-018,564,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Currently, the parties appoint a set of hakam to support them through this process and the hakam derive their authority from the parties. If one of the parties decides to hold up the process by not giving the hakam the authority to resolve the marital dispute, the SYC can step in to appoint a second set of hakam. This can prolong the grief of parties, as this requires parties to go through the entire process again with the SYC-appointed hakam."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00565,2022-02-14-T-018,565,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are thus proposing to amend the law so that the SYC can work directly with the first set of hakam to authorise the hakam to pronounce the divorce, even if the husband refuses to authorise the hakam if it is in the interest of both parties to do so."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00566,2022-02-14-T-018,566,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Clauses 8, 9 and 10 work together to remove the payment of fees as a condition for the registration of a divorce to prevent abuse by parties who disagree with the SYC's decision. This is so that no party can delay registration of a divorce already recognised by the Court under Muslim law through the non-payment of fees."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00567,2022-02-14-T-018,567,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"AMLA confers MUIS with administrative powers to administer key functions of Muslim religious life in Singapore. These include the administration of mosques, halal certification and Muslim religious education."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00568,2022-02-14-T-018,568,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The next set of amendments I would like to highlight seeks to update MUIS' administrative powers, so that they reflect current realities."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00569,2022-02-14-T-018,569,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, clause 17 updates archaic terms, such as ""jawantankuasa daerah"" and replace them with the more relevant term, ""jawantankuasa masjid"", while clauses 18 and 19 update AMLA to enable MUIS' exercise of powers to collect fees for the exercise of statutory functions relating to halal certification and the administration of the Asatizah Recognition Scheme."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00570,2022-02-14-T-018,570,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The last group of amendments I would like to draw the House's attention to are clauses 4, 5 and 6."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00571,2022-02-14-T-018,571,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,These amendments allow Muslim families undergoing divorce to benefit from the evidence-based measures for therapeutic justice that this House agreed to last month with the Women's Charter (Amendment) Act.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00572,2022-02-14-T-018,572,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"These are the provisions that allow the SYC to advise parents to secure the child's attendance at the Programme for Children during the divorce journey, if the SYC thinks that it would be beneficial, just as the Family Justice Courts now can. The aim of these provisions, as my colleague Minister of State Sun Xueling explained to the House last month, is to make sure that the best interests of the child are prioritised during the divorce process. This must be our objective for children of all marriages, whether civil or Muslim."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00573,2022-02-14-T-018,573,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The amendments do not change the fact that Muslim law will continue to apply to Muslim marriages and divorces.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00574,2022-02-14-T-018,574,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, this Bill seeks to ensure that AMLA continues to reflect the needs of the Muslim community and enable our Muslim institutions to better serve our Muslim community. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00575,2022-02-14-T-018,575,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00576,2022-02-14-T-018,576,Deputy Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00577,2022-02-14-T-018,577,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00578,2022-02-14-T-018,578,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Deputy Speaker, the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) is a special piece of legislation. It provides for particular facets of Muslim life in Singapore, including marriage and divorce – alongside other civil laws and rules applicable to non-Muslims – in our secular and plural nation."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00579,2022-02-14-T-018,579,Saktiandi Supaat,"The proposed amendments, which generally aim to keep the AMLA and its processes up-to-date, are timely and welcome. In particular, the digitalisation process utilising electronic communications instead of in-person appointments will greatly transform the Syariah Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages. However, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister on certain aspects of the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00580,2022-02-14-T-018,580,Saktiandi Supaat,"First, the Bill proposes to introduce new provisions to allow marriages and divorces to take place through a live video or television link. This not only makes permanent the temporary measures contained in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures for Solemnisation and Registration of Marriages) Act 2020, in fact, it goes further to allow divorces to take place remotely with the permission of the Syariah Court."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00581,2022-02-14-T-018,581,Saktiandi Supaat,"While the Office of the Mufti has issued an irsyad (guidance) that the use of video-conferencing for marriage proceedings is permissible under Islam, I have spoken to several young people who said that a wedding would only be meaningful if it is celebrated in the presence of family and friends. Hence, I would like to ask, what is the likely take-up rate of this virtual wedding option? Since this option was made available from May 2020, what is the number of couples who have applied for a virtual solemnisation with the Registry of Muslim Marriages, and how does this compare to the number of applications of an in-person solemnisation over the same period?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00582,2022-02-14-T-018,582,Saktiandi Supaat,"I also note that while couples are now allowed to solemnise their wedding virtually, whereby one condition is that both parties to the marriage, the witnesses and the wali (guardian) of the woman to be wedded must physically be in Singapore, does the Registrar of Muslim Marriages have the discretion to waive this requirement in extraordinary circumstances? For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out globally, there were Singaporeans who were stuck overseas and could not return for a certain period of time. If we are harnessing technology to make the solemnisation process easier for Muslim couples who wish to get married, I think it would be helpful to extend this to Singaporeans or Singapore residents who may be abroad at a particular time."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00583,2022-02-14-T-018,583,Saktiandi Supaat,"However, one other concern that I have is whether doing away with the formal, physical attendance before a kadi (solemniser), a wali (guardian) and witnesses would diminish the degree of solemnness and the weight of responsibility that one would attribute to marriage. This is especially pertinent when it comes to teenage and youth marriages, which has long been recognised to be a source of various societal issues, such as high divorce rates, dysfunctional families, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. In the context of civil marriages, it has been suggested that the Registry of Marriages will have the discretion to ask couples to go through the steps in-person where there may be suspicions of a marriage of convenience, for instance. What would be the circumstances where the Registrar of Muslim Marriages would withhold his/her approval for a virtual solemnisation? Would this include a situation where one or both parties have yet to reach 21 years of age?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00584,2022-02-14-T-018,584,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In English)  In English, please. On to remote proceedings, as I mentioned earlier, this appears to be a new innovation which goes beyond what COVID-19 (Temporary Measures for Solemnization and Registration of Marriages) Act 2020 had provided. Can the Minister shed any light on the rationale for the introduction of this innovation at this time?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00585,2022-02-14-T-018,585,Saktiandi Supaat,"Is it anticipated to form the norm for divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court, or will it remain the exception? If it is to be an exception, under what circumstances would we see remote divorce proceedings being deployed? And what would be the impact on Court users, especially when many of them are not represented by lawyers?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00586,2022-02-14-T-018,586,Saktiandi Supaat,"In going about our constituency work, I think Members may be familiar with how certain issues can be easily ironed out once parties meet and speak face-to-face, whereas numerous earlier rounds and months of exchanging emails and letters may have done little to move things along. In moving towards an impersonal approach to divorce proceedings – through remote Court proceedings coupled with the dispensation from having to obtain physical signatures on documents anymore – are we not reducing the opportunities for a disaffected couple to work out their issues and making a final divorce an inevitable conclusion?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00587,2022-02-14-T-018,587,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, exacerbating the concerns around divorce are the various other amendments in the Bill which appear to make it easier to obtain a final divorce."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00588,2022-02-14-T-018,588,Saktiandi Supaat,"One, the proposed amendment to section 50 removes the present need for the Syariah Court to appoint a second set of hakam, or arbitrators, to attempt reconciliation and pronounce divorce where reconciliation is not possible. Under the amended procedure, the first set of hakam would be empowered to pronounce a divorce if they are of the joint opinion that the parties should be divorced. What is the expected time saving from doing away with the second set of hakam? Are there any statistics on the number of marriages which have been saved from divorce by the second set of hakam?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00589,2022-02-14-T-018,589,Saktiandi Supaat,"Two, the Bill also proposes to remove the requirement for the payment of prescribed fees before the Syariah Court must cause a divorce to be registered. While I note the rationale that a party cannot be allowed to frustrate the divorce process by simply refusing to pay the fees, I would like to ask how the Syariah Court would go about enforcing the payment of such fees, especially if the divorce has already been registered."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00590,2022-02-14-T-018,590,Saktiandi Supaat,"At the same time, I very much welcome the amendments which enhance the Syariah Court's power to advise persons to attend counselling and family support programmes in the course of divorce proceedings."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00591,2022-02-14-T-018,591,Saktiandi Supaat,"There will now be a clear provision that the Syariah Court may advise one or both divorcing parties to secure the child's completion of a support programme for children. It cannot be gainsaid that, often, the biggest victims in a marriage that has broken down are the children of the family. Of no fault of their own, these children lose out on various aspects of family life going forward, at a time when they might not be intellectually mature enough to manage the loss. So, the ability to ensure that these children receive the necessary support is important. But what the Bill is silent on is  what consequences are there if parties fail to comply with the Court's advice to secure their children's completion of the support programme? Also, would there be further support or ""check-ins"" with the children beyond the completion of the divorce proceedings, say, one year or two years later?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00592,2022-02-14-T-018,592,Saktiandi Supaat,"The Bill also provides that the Syariah Court may advise the ""prescribed persons"" to attend a family support programme or activity beyond the divorcing parties and their children. Who are these ""prescribed persons"" that are being contemplated? Again, what is the expected practical utility if it is not compulsory for such persons to comply with this advice, as the Explanatory Statement spells out?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00593,2022-02-14-T-018,593,Saktiandi Supaat,"Some final miscellaneous questions in brief, Mr Deputy Speaker."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00594,2022-02-14-T-018,594,Saktiandi Supaat,"One, I notice that clause 22 of the Bill purports to remove the requirement to use a prescribed form to apply for divorce or revocation of divorce. Is this part of a broader plan to overhaul the Syariah Court filing system, to create an electronic filing system like e-litigation? If so, are there plans to issue guidance to lawyers and litigants-in-person and will the Ministry consider some form of transition period where parties may be exempted from paying extra Court fees if they make inadvertent errors in filing their documents?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00595,2022-02-14-T-018,595,Saktiandi Supaat,"Two, clause 24 of the Bill proposes amending section 139(2) AMLA such that the Mufti's evidence that a doctrine, ceremony or act is contrary to the Muslim law shall be presumptively accepted by a criminal Court prosecuting an offence under section 139(1). More fundamentally, is such a provision necessary since section 32(7) of AMLA already provides that any Court may refer any question of Muslim law to the Legal Committee which the Mufti chairs? Would section 139(2) not usurp the power of the Legal Committee, who must exercise its power through a quorum of not only the Mufti but also two fit and proper Muslims who may also be learned Muslim religious leaders?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00596,2022-02-14-T-018,596,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the clarifications sought, I support the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00597,2022-02-14-T-018,597,Deputy Speaker,Mr Faisal Manap.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00598,2022-02-14-T-018,598,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I deliver my speech in Malay."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00599,2022-02-14-T-018,599,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Sir, I support this amendment Bill. In this short speech, I would like to offer my views, seek clarifications and relay my concerns on some issues contained in this amendment Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00600,2022-02-14-T-018,600,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In addition, I will briefly touch on section 139 of AMLA, relating to false doctrine, although it is not related to this amendment Bill. However, since this issue is an important one and, in the interest of Muslims in Singapore, I would like to highlight this matter in the hope that a change can be made to this section in future."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00601,2022-02-14-T-018,601,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, it is quite natural that whenever a challenging or pressing situation occurs, changes to the norm will be needed so that daily living activities can continue. We have seen at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many couples who had plans to hold their solemnisation ceremonies and wedding receptions were affected, due to the implementation of the COVID-19 regulations, which were implemented to safeguard the safety and well-being of our people. Despite the numerous obstacles faced by many couples in the last two years, they do acknowledge that these strict controls are necessary and they bravely and patiently overcame these obstacles so that they can proceed to build a home together. I would like to congratulate these couples for successfully overcoming these trials and tribulations and offer my best wishes to them. I hope and pray that their marriage will last until the end."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00602,2022-02-14-T-018,602,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I support the efforts to digitise the Syariah Court process."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00603,2022-02-14-T-018,603,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"However, I would like to express my concern over the possible undesirable negative impact."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00604,2022-02-14-T-018,604,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,It is human nature that any convenience and ease when undergoing a process can influence one's assessment when making a decision. My concern is that the convenient access to the Syariah Court process through digitalisation can influence the assessment of parties wishing to divorce.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00605,2022-02-14-T-018,605,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"For example, based on my past experience in conducting counselling sessions for cases referred by the Court, the divorce process, which can take some time, could sometimes provide more time and space for the divorcing couple to make a deeper assessment before making the final decision to separate. This is because, some married couples make a hasty decision to divorce without much thought because they feel very distressed due to anger and frustration."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00606,2022-02-14-T-018,606,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"By simplifying the Syariah Court process through digitalisation, which is made easy with a click of a button, this ""convenience"" factor will erase any additional space and time that could have enabled the divorcing parties to make a much deeper assessment."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00607,2022-02-14-T-018,607,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"However, I acknowledge that simplifying the Court processes through digitalisation will be good for divorce cases that should be resolved quickly. These include cases of irrevocable divorce and also cases with elements of domestic violence, where divorce may be the best way out."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00608,2022-02-14-T-018,608,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In light of these concerns that I have stated, I hope the Syariah Court, in implementing digitalisation processes, can monitor the situation closely to avoid or mitigate any negative consequences arising from these improvements."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00609,2022-02-14-T-018,609,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, concerns about the unintended negative consequences when implementing digitalisation processes, were also expressed during the public consultation exercise held by MCCY in August and September 2021. Among the feedback received are the use of digitalisation and absence of oral hearings, which can negatively impact the justice process. It is said that such a situation could cause uneasiness because the plaintiffs and the defendants could not witness the process that was carried out, or could not understand how the Court reached its decision."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00610,2022-02-14-T-018,610,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Arising from this concern, the Ministry gave its assurance that the Syariah Court and the MUIS Appeal Board would conduct the process through digital channels only if all parties are agreeable. At the same time, it also emphasised that digital channels are not meant to replace existing methods. I believe what the Ministry stated. I just wish to reiterate that the Syariah Court, the MUIS Appeal Board and the Registry of Muslim Marriages should monitor and take appropriate steps so that there will not be any negative consequences, or at least ensure that any potential undesirable negative impact that may arise when implementing these digitalisation measures is kept as low as possible."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00611,2022-02-14-T-018,611,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I would also like to express my support for the proposal to allow divorce registration, even in circumstances where the registered party cannot afford to pay the registration fee. This is stated in clause 8, 9 and 10 of this amendment Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00612,2022-02-14-T-018,612,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I was also approached by some residents who had difficulty paying the registration fee and asked me to appeal to the Syariah Court to set aside the registration fee. Often, such requests come from wives who do not have any income because they are fulfilling their responsibilities as full-time housewives. These changes can eliminate that feeling of utter helplessness that is felt by those facing financial issues."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00613,2022-02-14-T-018,613,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, next, clause 11 introduces an amendment to section 50, which enables the first set of appointed hakam to make a divorce pronouncement without requiring a new set of hakam. I would like to seek a clarification, if possible, with an example about the challenges or shortcomings in the existing hakam system that spurred the Syariah Court to take these improvement measures.  However, I believe that the Minister had earlier provided some examples on this matter."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00614,2022-02-14-T-018,614,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, clause 18 makes amendments to section 87(9), to clarify that the Council (MUIS) can ask for payment of fees in the performance of functions related to the madrasah through the laws under this section. I would like to request information from the Ministry to provide some examples of MUIS' functions which require payment of fees by the madrasah. In this matter, I hope the amount of fees charged, if any and if necessary, will not burden the madrasah."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00615,2022-02-14-T-018,615,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Here, Sir, I would like to declare that I have a child attending full-time madrasah."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00616,2022-02-14-T-018,616,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The final thing I will be touching on is section 139 which is about false doctrine. As I mentioned earlier, I would like to raise this matter because it is important."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00617,2022-02-14-T-018,617,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, in reply to my Parliamentary Question in September 2021, on whether there is a need to review and increase the number of existing summonses, that is, the amount not exceeding $2,000 for offenders in connection with false doctrine, the Minister stated, ""Offences under AMLA are reviewed periodically to ensure they are consistent with broader legal policies and are effective in deterring offenders. Any attempt to apply legislation to religious matters must be carefully considered. In the case of deviant teachings, I previously shared that MUIS seeks to address these problems at the root, by adopting a multi-pronged approach of counselling individuals and inoculating the public against harmful ideologies""."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00618,2022-02-14-T-018,618,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I agree with the approach of addressing issues related to deviant teachings through methods, such as counselling services and public education against the dangers of such ideologies. However, I feel that if the punishment for offenders can be further enhanced, it may be a preventive factor and thus strengthen the existing efforts to combat as well as prevent it. I hope this proposal can be considered again."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00619,2022-02-14-T-018,619,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"With this, Sir, I end my speech by expressing my support once again for this amendment Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00620,2022-02-14-T-018,620,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"(In English)  Sir, I support this amendment Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00621,2022-02-14-T-018,621,Deputy Speaker,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00622,2022-02-14-T-018,622,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 has accelerated the digitalisation of processes for Singaporeans. Whether it is working from home, scanning QR codes or managing digital wallets, many of us have become more comfortable with the use of remote technologies and virtual conferencing. I am glad that we are now making amendments that will, hopefully, bring the same benefits of digitalisation to the Syariah Court or SYC."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00623,2022-02-14-T-018,623,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I would like to ask for some clarifications mainly relating to the digitalisation and stakeholder preparedness for new processes to ensure that the quality of the proceedings does not erode in the transition online and consideration for areas and scenarios in which digital processes may not, for the time being, be sufficient."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00624,2022-02-14-T-018,624,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The insertion of section 45A provides that the SYC or Appeal Board may conduct hearings through electronic means of communication. There are challenges and potential points of amelioration in the transition to digital proceedings from the perspectives of Court, counsel and witnesses. Safeguards need to be put in place to protect amongst other things, the propriety, solemnity, integrity and orderliness of proceedings. It is important to ensure that each party can express their case independently, fairly with all relevant details."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00625,2022-02-14-T-018,625,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The complexity of this transition must be tackled head on. For SYC users and officers who may not find the digitalised processes intuitive, or those who want to use them but face difficulties, what training, resources and support will be available for individuals who need help – in particular, SYC staff or litigants-in-person? How long will the transition take and how will ongoing cases during this transition be impacted?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00626,2022-02-14-T-018,626,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Currently, the choice of setting up a dedicated venue to provide a conducive setting for online hearings is left up to the discretion of counsel. Not everyone can afford representation and, even when they can, there may be other prohibitive factors that come into play. Will the Minister consider establishing a centralised dedicated venue to facilitate this?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00627,2022-02-14-T-018,627,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,There are also lessons which we can learn from incidents overseas. An online court hearing held in the US in March 2021 was halted when a prosecutor realised that the victim and her abuser were in the same room in her house. The abuser intended to intimidate his victim to coerce her into adjusting her testimony by being in a position where he could threaten her safety. He did this while pretending on screen that they were in two separate locations.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00628,2022-02-14-T-018,628,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"It was fortunate in this case that the prosecutor caught on, but, unlike a physical court setting where there are significant safeguards against intimidation, the possibility of a similar scenario in the example earlier is more likely online. What checks would be in place to prevent such actions from happening?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00629,2022-02-14-T-018,629,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Many of us would have also experienced frustrating technology failures at some point, for example, due to an unstable Internet connection or an issue with the device. It would be important for parties to virtual Court proceedings to be permitted to change to an alternative device if a party encounters video malfunction in the midst of a remote hearing. However, in the event there is no alternative device, would parties be permitted to defer the proceedings?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00630,2022-02-14-T-018,630,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I also understand that, in such an event with all parties' unanimous consent, SYC may proceed with the remainder of the hearing through live audio link only, without an accompanying live video stream. Without an actual video feed for corroboration, I would like to ask what safeguards will SYC put in place to ensure that proceedings conducted by electronic means are conducted in a way that is fair to all parties?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00631,2022-02-14-T-018,631,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As we move forward with these changes, it will be useful for the public to also understand factors that are considered by SYC when deciding under what circumstances a matter will be decided without hearing oral arguments, as permitted with the insertion of section 35B. For such matters, the judge will be making decisions based on affidavits and submissions only. In such cases, could the Minister share some examples of proceedings where oral arguments will not be necessary? I ask this in hopes of getting clarity that there will be little risk for those who are not equipped to provide an affidavit with enough relevant context or details, in particular, any litigants-in-person. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00632,2022-02-14-T-018,632,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment Bill will have a positive effect on the hearing process, particularly if we encounter complicated situations like a pandemic which prevent certain parties from meeting physically. However, as we strive to implement digital proceedings, it is very important for us to ensure that each party is able to submit statements and get fair and full representation that is free from any threat or intimidation. In my speech, I presented three main focus areas. These include how the Syariah Court can consider several situations where the hearing process may be unsuitable or is not yet suitable to be held online."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00633,2022-02-14-T-018,633,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In essence, we should be concerned that there are still those within our community who may not be ready for this transition and our digitalisation efforts should facilitate the hearing process from the perspective of certain parties without affecting the safety, protection and rights of each party to seek equitable access to justice. I hope this amendment will not result in more pressure or difficulties for certain parties and I hope that adequate preparations, support and resources will be provided for everyone, including Court officials, in this transition."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00634,2022-02-14-T-018,634,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a secondary area of clarification I have is with regard to the proposed section 43C, which has been raised in a previous Sitting, as mentioned earlier. I am heartened that support for children is becoming more explicit and expanded. This is important, as, even though it was mentioned then that the bulk of responsibility should fall on the parents, during these difficult times, especially, not all parents may be sufficiently equipped to also play the roles of counsellor, psychiatrist and other roles for a child's care that may require a professional to better protect their well-being. These complexities raise questions on who should be making the decisions for the programmes and how they are arriving at them. I would like to clarify what would be guiding the decision-making process the Courts will be using to reach a specific recommendation. What are perhaps some of the factors which will be considered in order to accomplish this?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00635,2022-02-14-T-018,635,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Furthermore, even though parents want the best for their children, grief and other stressors might make it difficult for them to comply with the order. How will we make sure that there is also appropriate support and resources for parents? And if parents prove they are unable to comply with the order, what other steps can be taken? In the context of the amendments at hand, how will the programmes be tailor-made for our community and how can support be better coordinated in the best interest of the child?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00636,2022-02-14-T-018,636,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"While so much has been made possible and more convenient with digitalisation and broader access to support programmes, it is important that the interests and quality of justice remain the overriding priority in this case. Notwithstanding my clarifications, Sir, I support the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00637,2022-02-14-T-018,637,Deputy Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00638,2022-02-14-T-018,638,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. I declare that I am a practising lawyer. Allow me to speak in the National Language."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00639,2022-02-14-T-018,639,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I welcome the amendments to the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). In particular, the amendment allows the Syariah Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) to use digital processes for Court administration and solemnisations. The amendments update the administration of Muslim marriages and divorces. It also increases the support given to families who undergo the divorce process, especially children. This is in line with the broader development in family law under the Women's Charter which was recently updated."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00640,2022-02-14-T-018,640,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Digital processes also allows the Syariah Court and ROMM to leverage on technology, coordinate services and facilitate access to the community. This is important to help us prepare for challenges ahead, including any new pandemic in the future."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00641,2022-02-14-T-018,641,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"For example, the Syariah Court previously did not have an electronic document filing system like the High Court or Family Court. For roughly a few weeks during the circuit breaker period, no hearings could be conducted because there was no provision for video or online hearings. Now, the Syariah Court is able to conduct Court hearings and proceedings via video."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00642,2022-02-14-T-018,642,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Hence, these amendments actually reflect what is being practised in Court, which is the use of video links through WebEx and so on. These preparations will build greater resilience in the delivery of services by the Syariah Court and thus empower the Syariah Court to deal with new situations in the future."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00643,2022-02-14-T-018,643,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In my speech on the recent Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill, I highlighted the Syariah Court's experience in successfully incorporating counselling and children-centric programmes to help the divorce process in Court. With these amendments to AMLA, what other alignments can be made between AMLA and the recently amended Women's Charter in order to better support families and children who are going through divorce?"
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00644,2022-02-14-T-018,644,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Here, I will focus on four areas within the amendments to this Act."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00645,2022-02-14-T-018,645,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"First, hearings without oral arguments. Second, clarifications on the status of the hakam. Third, restriction of access to the Register of Muslim Marriages. Fourth, the Mufti's role in submitting evidence to Court."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00646,2022-02-14-T-018,646,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"First, the amendment to section 35B allows the Syariah Court or the Appeal Board to proceed without hearing oral arguments. This is consistent with other changes in civil jurisdiction which allow for determination using documents only in certain cases. This will not only save costs, but also reduce the time needed for a divorce case."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00647,2022-02-14-T-018,647,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I would like to highlight section 35B(2) which does not allow the Court to proceed with the trial without oral arguments, if part of the proceedings already has oral evidence presented."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00648,2022-02-14-T-018,648,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"My question is, what about a situation where the plaintiff has already given oral evidence but the Defendant subsequently fails or refuses to participate in further proceedings? Typically, in that scenario, the Court hears the case in absentia of the Defendant and makes the necessary orders, but this means that the plaintiff has to be present, and has to spend time and money to go through an oral hearing."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00649,2022-02-14-T-018,649,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I would like to suggest that the Courts be allowed to decide to proceed with the hearings without oral arguments as well.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00650,2022-02-14-T-018,650,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"These amendments also allow the MUIS Appeal Board to decide that oral arguments are not required even if written submissions have been filed. However, I am concerned that a party or parties may feel aggrieved as they did not see the ""process"" of the appeal or hearing and may not understand why their appeal was dismissed, if all the trial process was held without oral arguments and done through the exchange of documents."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00651,2022-02-14-T-018,651,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"While I am cognisant that in other forums or civil courts, there is a practice of not requiring the attendance of parties at a hearing, however, it is common for MUIS Appeal Board hearings at the moment for the parties to attend and observe the proceedings in full, even though the Court's final verdict will only be published or given a few weeks later. This is the process that lawyers, Courts and parties have been accustomed to when going through the divorce process in Singapore all this while."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00652,2022-02-14-T-018,652,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, I am worried whether this will impact the perception of parties and society on the adage that it is not just for justice to be done but to be seen to be done because they are unable to observe the proceedings. We should not pursue efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of Court processes, at the expense of losing what we already have."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00653,2022-02-14-T-018,653,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I suggest that the Syariah Court and the Appeal Board openly publish the reasons and grounds of decisions for every case on the MUIS or Syariah Court's website. This will help litigants to understand that although there are no oral hearings or arguments, their full cases have been canvassed carefully in the written form."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00654,2022-02-14-T-018,654,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Second, the status of the hakam's appointment."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00655,2022-02-14-T-018,655,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I agree with the replacement of the terms ""arbitration"" and ""arbitrators"" with ""hakam"" only. This is because arbitration bears a different technical meaning compared to hakam."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00656,2022-02-14-T-018,656,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I also agree with the amendments to allow the Syariah Court to give authorisation to the first set of hakam to pronounce a divorce, should the husband refuse to authorise the hakam to pronounce the divorce."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00657,2022-02-14-T-018,657,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"This is because, in certain cases, some wilfully refuse to authorise the hakam or refuse to make payment of the hakam fees and this would further delay proceedings."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00658,2022-02-14-T-018,658,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"There appears to be divergent views by scholars on whether the husband must expressly agree to delegate his ""powers"" or right to divorce his wife, to the hakam during divorce proceedings. The MUIS Appeal Board case of Azman bin Abdul Rani v Rahmah bte Ramli (1998) 1 SSAR 93 seems to suggest that this delegation is critical."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00659,2022-02-14-T-018,659,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I, therefore, welcome the proposed amendment which states that the hakam may pronounce a divorce in the absence of full authority from their respective principals. Hence, even if the husband refuses to sign the form or delegate his power, the hakam may pronounce a divorce in certain cases."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00660,2022-02-14-T-018,660,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Nevertheless, I think that it would still be useful to clarify the scope of the hakam's role. I propose that the definition of ""hakam"" be included in the amendments, with a clear explanation of the hakam's scope and role – perhaps in the subsidiary legislation – so that the community can understand the hakam's role and accept the decision of the hakam later."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00661,2022-02-14-T-018,661,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Moving on to the issue of payment to the hakam. In some cases, there are those who refuse to pay for the hakam's costs. In order to avoid further delays to divorce proceedings, can the Syariah Court order that payment be deducted from the relevant party's share of matrimonial assets or claims? This will allow the divorce proceedings to continue smoothly."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00662,2022-02-14-T-018,662,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Third, restriction of access to the Register of Muslim Marriages."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00663,2022-02-14-T-018,663,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Section 143 previously provides that any party may apply to the Registrar to inspect and obtain copies or extracts from ROMM and Register of Revocation of Divorces.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00664,2022-02-14-T-018,664,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The current amendment aims to restrict access to the Register of Muslim Marriages only. The rationale stated by MCCY in the Bill Consultation Outcome dated 12 October 2021 is that such restriction of access is ""consistent with the broader policies on the protection of personal information""."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00665,2022-02-14-T-018,665,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I agree with protecting personal data and limiting access to classes of persons as prescribed.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00666,2022-02-14-T-018,666,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Here, I would like to ask  what are the ""classes of persons"" allowed access to the Register of Marriages?	This is important because it involves an element of public interest for Muslim marriages here and overseas. For example, the bride-to-be or her family from overseas may need proof or access to the marital status of a groom who is Singaporean or who is domiciled in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00667,2022-02-14-T-018,667,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"On the other hand, there are no restrictions to apply for a copy from the Register of Divorces. Would that entry in the Register of Divorces not also contain personal data? Why is access to the Register of Marriages limited to certain classes of party? Perhaps access to the Register of Divorces should also be similarly limited."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00668,2022-02-14-T-018,668,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I propose that perhaps the Civil Court procedure for the Request and Order of Inspection of Court documents can be applied.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00669,2022-02-14-T-018,669,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In the civil process, the requesting party has to file a request to inspect and obtain copies of Court documents. Before being allowed to do so, the party has to provide reasons and, in certain cases, be called before a Registrar to provide sufficient explanation before being given permission to inspect and obtain copies or documents from the Court."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00670,2022-02-14-T-018,670,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Here, perhaps the ROMM Registrar can exercise the same standard for requests, whether it is for the Register of Marriages or the Register of Divorces."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00671,2022-02-14-T-018,671,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Finally, the Mufti's role in giving evidence."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00672,2022-02-14-T-018,672,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Section 139 of AMLA makes it a criminal offence to conduct deviant teachings or anything relating to Islam in a manner contrary to Muslim law. It also provides for the Court to presume that a doctrine, ceremony or any act is, indeed, contrary to Muslim law if the MUIS President submits evidence that it is so."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00673,2022-02-14-T-018,673,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The current amendment, which replaces the MUIS President with the Mufti, so that the Mufti can provide evidence directly to Court on matters that are contrary to Muslim law, is a welcomed one. I support this because the Mufti is the highest Islamic religious authority in Singapore and chairs our Fatwa Committee. Therefore, the Mufti is better placed to give evidence in Court on Muslim law and the Court will follow the Mufti's evidence."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00674,2022-02-14-T-018,674,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Here, I would like to ask why the same could not be applied to section 114 of AMLA in relation to questions of succession and inheritance in Muslim law. Presently, section 114 of AMLA makes reference to fixed list of religious books. I understand that this is being considered for the future. However, may I suggest that, just as how section 139 was amended, section 114 of AMLA can also refer to the Mufti if there are questions on Muslim law for inheritance and succession matters. This will help make Court rulings more conclusive and consistent. I would also like to repeat my previous suggestion my past speeches, that perhaps the issue of Muslim inheritance and succession, including inheritance certificates, should be dealt with by the Syariah Court instead of the Civil Courts, because it involves Muslim law evidence and public interest that is guided by Islamic teachings."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00675,2022-02-14-T-018,675,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00676,2022-02-14-T-018,676,Deputy Speaker,Minister Masagos Zulkifli.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00677,2022-02-14-T-018,677,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Members who have risen to support the Bill."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00678,2022-02-14-T-018,678,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The AMLA is an important piece of legislation for the Muslim community. Our reviews are intended to ensure that it remains robust and relevant, stays up-to-date with new programmes and processes, and above all, serves the needs of our Muslim community in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00679,2022-02-14-T-018,679,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I am heartened by the support from Members and their suggestions. I hope Members will understand if I focus my responses on the issues directly related to the specific Bill. For example, I will not deal with issues on deviant teaching – for which there is a specific case that is under Police investigation."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00680,2022-02-14-T-018,680,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Let me now address the points and queries raised.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00681,2022-02-14-T-018,681,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Allow me to summarise the details on the processes that will be digitalised under the SYC. First, SYC will replace its old case management system with a new IT system to improve case management and communication with Court users. The process of filing and issuing all Court documents will be digitalised."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00682,2022-02-14-T-018,682,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This means that a Court user will be able to file, or submit, documents anytime and from any location using SingPass, or, if they are a lawyer acting on behalf of a party to proceedings, using CorpPass. Through a fully personalised dashboard upon log-in, a Court user, whether a litigant or a lawyer, will be able to view upcoming Court attendances, outstanding tasks given by the Court and access digital copies of filed documents."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00683,2022-02-14-T-018,683,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This convenience is extended to the pre-Court process. For example, the registration process to attend the Marriage Counselling Programme will also be digitalised."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00684,2022-02-14-T-018,684,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, this Bill will allow SYC and ROMM to conduct Court proceedings and marriage solemnisations via electronic means of communication in appropriate situations. SYC and ROMM trialled these video-link processes during the pandemic and the community benefited from them. Since May 2020, close to 100 couples or about 1% of total Muslim marriages, have conducted their marriage solemnisation through digital means during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, this digital option allowed some couples to proceed with the video-link solemnisation even when their witnesses had contracted COVID-19 and, therefore, could not attend in person. This saved the couples the trouble of postponing the solemnisation, which would incur additional costs and time."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00685,2022-02-14-T-018,685,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"During these video-link solemnisations, the Kadi would conduct the same tasks as he would during in-person solemnisations. This includes confirming the identities and consent of the couples to the marriage, giving a short sermon and supplication, and blessing the couples. The only difference is that the entire process takes place via live video-link."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00686,2022-02-14-T-018,686,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would like to assure Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Faisal Manap that the Kadi will continue to emphasise the sanctity of marriage and the responsibilities the spouses have to each other. For marriage applications involving minors, before a decision is made as to whether virtual solemnisation will be allowed, all parties and their parents must attend in-person sessions with the Kadi, who will assess the couples' readiness for marriage and the level of support from the parents."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00687,2022-02-14-T-018,687,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To Mr Saktiandi Supaat's question, proceedings that are held virtually using electronic means of communication are neither the norm nor the default mode for hearings in the Court and before an Appeal Board. We have learned from the various episodes of the COVID-19 crisis in the last two years that disrupted necessary processes even when technological options existed because there were no provisions in law for them. We needed to pass the time-limited temporary provisions to enable these virtually. Therefore, the option to conduct proceedings virtually allows the Court and an Appeal Board to hear any matter expeditiously, even if there are disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00688,2022-02-14-T-018,688,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Beyond national emergencies, where the circumstances of a particular case do not require the physical attendance of parties or their lawyers in the Court room, the presiding judge of the Court, or an Appeal Board, will assess the necessity and appropriateness of conducting the proceedings virtually on a case-by-case basis."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00689,2022-02-14-T-018,689,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether the convenience of virtual solemnisations could be extended to marriages where at least one party is overseas. While we recognise the convenience that this proposal may bring, we will need to study this carefully."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00690,2022-02-14-T-018,690,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Under section 95(3) of AMLA, the Kadi must be satisfied that there is no lawful obstacle under Muslim law or AMLA to the intended marriage. Hence, if the Kadi is unable to ascertain whether the party outside Singapore has legal capacity to contract the marriage, the conditions under this section will not be met."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00691,2022-02-14-T-018,691,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Similar to the requirements for the use of remote communication technology for the solemnisation of Muslim marriages under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures for Solemnisation and Registration of Marriages) Act 2020, currently, all parties to the intended marriage must be physically present in Singapore. This acts as a safeguard to ensure that all the conditions set out under Muslim law on the validity of the marriage and other legal requirements under section 95(3) of AMLA are fulfilled."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00692,2022-02-14-T-018,692,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Digitalisation will not affect the fairness of the Court proceedings or the integrity of marriage solemnisations. This is our resolve and assurance to Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Faisal Manap. SYC and ROMM will ensure that religious and customary practices are still fulfilled and justice is served. SYC and ROMM have adopted best practices and developed multiple safeguards to protect the propriety, solemnity, integrity and orderliness of digital proceedings."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00693,2022-02-14-T-018,693,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim expressed concern that the proposed amendments may change the manner of appeal hearings and the delivery of verdict by the Appeal Board which lawyers and parties have been accustomed to. The concern is that allowing Court proceedings to proceed without oral hearings could affect the perception of justice being done, as parties could feel aggrieved as they are not able to witness in-person the ""process"" or how the Court arrives at an outcome."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00694,2022-02-14-T-018,694,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Let me explain. The new section 35B is an enabling provision to allow the Court or Appeal Board to decide any matter without an oral hearing and asynchronously, in a suitable case."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00695,2022-02-14-T-018,695,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The traditional mode of conducting proceedings synchronously by an oral hearing is still in place and will continue to be the default manner of proceedings.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00696,2022-02-14-T-018,696,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I would like to assure the community that the new section 35B(4) prevents SYC and Appeal Board from hearing a matter in a manner that would be inconsistent with its duty to conduct proceedings fairly to all parties.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00697,2022-02-14-T-018,697,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Ms Nadia Samdin asked what factors are considered when deciding that alternative modes of conducting proceedings are appropriate.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00698,2022-02-14-T-018,698,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,This Bill will make available to SYC and Appeal Board the option of using electronic means of communication in place of physical attendance and the option to conduct proceedings in an asynchronous manner in place of an oral hearing.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00699,2022-02-14-T-018,699,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Asynchronous hearings, which are proceedings without an oral hearing, are typically allowed if the application is straightforward."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00700,2022-02-14-T-018,700,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"An example would be where both parties consent to the application, or the application is made by one party but may be dealt with in the absence of the other party. For such applications, an oral hearing is ordinarily not required because all relevant facts of the case have been submitted in affidavits, which is the primary mode of giving evidence to the Court. Legal submissions will also unlikely be required for such cases."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00701,2022-02-14-T-018,701,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Conducting the proceedings in an asynchronous manner would ordinarily not be appropriate where oral arguments are required from counsel or the litigants-in-person. This is typically the case for divorce hearings or trials, including an appeal hearing before the Appeal Board. While an oral hearing is necessary in such cases, physical attendance of the counsel and the litigants-in-person may be dispensed with and the proceedings of the oral hearing may be conducted virtually where appropriate."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00702,2022-02-14-T-018,702,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To Ms Nadia Samdin's query, the Court is not precluded from allowing the use of an alternative device in the midst of hearing should there be a technical difficulty as long as it is on an electronic communication platform approved by the Courts."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00703,2022-02-14-T-018,703,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about a situation where the Plaintiff has already given oral evidence but the Defendant fails or refuses to participate in further proceedings.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00704,2022-02-14-T-018,704,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For such cases, where oral evidence has been given, there are safeguards to protect the rights of both parties in the litigation process. The Court will have to, first, assess whether the subsequent conduct of the hearing in an asynchronous manner will allow proceedings to be conducted fairly to both parties. The Court is required to obtain the consent of the Plaintiff to waive his or her right to continue with the oral hearing before the Court may proceed to conduct the remaining part of the proceedings in an asynchronous manner."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00705,2022-02-14-T-018,705,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We agree with Ms Nadia Samdin that in setting up a dedicated venue to provide a centralised setting for online trials, we need to protect the vulnerable, such as those suffering domestic abuse cases, and ensure that they are able to make their cases fairly and free from intimidation."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00706,2022-02-14-T-018,706,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I want to reiterate that SYC will adopt alternative modes of conducting proceedings only where appropriate and facilitative.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00707,2022-02-14-T-018,707,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since mid-2020, SYC has worked closely with members of the Bar on the implementation of electronic communication technology for Court proceedings. The common goal is to ensure that all SYC hearings that are conducted virtually are done in a just, secure and private manner, in accordance with the law and SYC's practice guidelines."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00708,2022-02-14-T-018,708,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For any reason where a virtual hearing may impact the fairness of the proceedings, SYC will arrange for a physical hearing, where the Court house of SYC is the default location. Where there may be a serious risk of violence, separate courtrooms may be provided at SYC. This is an additional measure on top of existing security protocols taken for all Court cases, such as Police presence at each Court hearing."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00709,2022-02-14-T-018,709,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The legal community welcomes this introduction of virtual proceedings. For example, Ms Shahirah Nassir, a lawyer at RW Law Practice, supports having proceedings held virtually. While there were expected teething problems during the transitional period, such as video lag or audio quality issues, she felt that sessions were conducted on time and there were minimal technical issues faced. More importantly, she found the platform to be a secure one that addresses security and privacy concerns in Court proceedings and the implementation of proceedings to be conducted remotely is in line with the numerous measures adopted by the Syariah Court to prioritise safety during COVID-19."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00710,2022-02-14-T-018,710,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ms Nadia Samdin asked how we will get the public on board on these changes, who may not find the changes intuitive. For its new digital system, SYC will establish a Helpdesk to provide users with technical support. SYC will also publish clear and complete user guidelines and videos on the SYC website."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00711,2022-02-14-T-018,711,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The system is currently in the design stage and SYC will continue to work with partners and stakeholders to give litigants-in-person the necessary support and assistance they may need.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00712,2022-02-14-T-018,712,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,SYC and its bench of Judges will also continue to engage members of the Bar to help prepare all Court users for the upcoming changes in the second half of this year. The detailed implementation of the new electronic filing system will be set out in the subsidiary legislation.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00713,2022-02-14-T-018,713,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,This Bill also seeks to improve the legal processes relating to marriage and divorce. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked who would be allowed access to the Register of Muslim Marriages and the Register of Revocation of Divorces.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00714,2022-02-14-T-018,714,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Only parties to the marriage and family members of parties to the marriage may do so. This is in line with who can access the Register of Marriages kept by ROM.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00715,2022-02-14-T-018,715,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For the Register of Muslim Divorces, the requesting party will be required to apply to SYC for a copy of an entry in the Register and must provide reasons to show sufficient interest in the matter. This is in line with the way similar information in the Family Justice Courts is protected."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00716,2022-02-14-T-018,716,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for his support of the amendments to section 50 on improving the process of proceedings conducted by the hakam. The role of a hakam is described in section 50. He is a person appointed by the Court to act for either the husband or the wife in divorce proceedings and will endeavour to effect a reconciliation and, if that is not possible, to facilitate an amicable resolution to the marital dispute."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00717,2022-02-14-T-018,717,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The number of cases in which hakam for the husband and hakam for the wife are jointly of the opinion that parties should be divorced because they are in a state of irreconcilable differences but the husband refuses to pronounce talak or authorise his hakam to do so, is less than 1% a year. Hence, the amendment seeks to reduce acrimony and emotional hardship in such cases."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00718,2022-02-14-T-018,718,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's query, in situations where one party creates an impasse by refusing to pay the hakam fees, the aggrieved party may seek redress from the Court at the hearing on ancillary matters to be reimbursed the payment that has been made on behalf of the defaulting party."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00719,2022-02-14-T-018,719,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On a quite unrelated note, to Mr Faisal Manap's query on the non-payment of divorce fees, the Court has discretion to waive fees for reasons they deem acceptable, like the unaffordability of the party."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00720,2022-02-14-T-018,720,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To Mr Saktiandi Supaat's query, under current provisions, a divorce is registered upon payment of an administrative fee. This is a technicality that the amendment seeks to rectify by delinking payment of the divorce registration fee with the Court's power to order the registration of the divorce."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00721,2022-02-14-T-018,721,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I fully agree with Mr Saktiandi Supaat that divorces are not to be taken lightly and the SYC strives to save marriages where it is possible to do so.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00722,2022-02-14-T-018,722,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"There are various opportunities for a disaffected couple to work out their issues. First, parties are required to attend SYC's Marriage Counselling Programme, which was made mandatory at the last round of amendments. Second, after the divorce application has been filed in Court, parties attend a mediation session where they can still explore reconciliation options as well as areas of agreement for an amicable resolution to their marital dispute. Third, parties may attend counselling or other family support activity or programme where they can receive support from professional counsellors and other social work professionals."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00723,2022-02-14-T-018,723,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,We will continue to help couples work towards amicable resolutions where possible. Our efforts are bearing fruit. More than half of the divorces registered in the past five years are settled amicably on all issues relating to the divorce application.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00724,2022-02-14-T-018,724,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Next, let me address Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's query on what more is being done beyond these amendments for Muslim families going through divorce and non-Muslim families governed under the Women's Charter."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00725,2022-02-14-T-018,725,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SYC works very closely with FJC and MSF to support Muslim families going through divorce. For example, SYC partners MSF to refer acrimonious cases to MSF's Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSA) to help these families with Supervised Exchange and Visitations. MSF provides these referred Muslim families the same level of funding support given to non-Muslim families undergoing divorce under the auspices of the Women's Charter."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00726,2022-02-14-T-018,726,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked who the ""prescribed class of persons"" may be under section 43A, where SYC may advise them, in addition to any of the parties or their children, to attend a family support programme or activity. We recognise that there may be other significant caregivers involved in a child's life, such as grandparents. The availability of family support programmes and activities is expanded to allow participation by such persons so that they may in turn help the child to better cope with his or her parents' divorce."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00727,2022-02-14-T-018,727,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To Ms Nadia Samdin's query, the Programme for Children encompasses a range of possible support for children, including an assessment of the needs of the child and specific interventions, such as group programmes, counselling or psychological services. The assessment process will be used to make recommendations to parents on suitable interventions based on the needs of the child. The overarching consideration is to work in the best interest of the child."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00728,2022-02-14-T-018,728,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MSF and MCCY will continue to work closely with the relevant professionals to ensure that these evidence-based intervention programmes will benefit any child who needs help to cope with his or her parents' divorce.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00729,2022-02-14-T-018,729,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ultimately, parents are responsible for their child's well-being. If they do not comply with the Court's advice, the Court will have the discretion to make any order it deems fit and, in relevant cases, may take the non-compliance of the parents into consideration in making custody, care and control and access orders, among other relevant factors, in determining the welfare of the child."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00730,2022-02-14-T-018,730,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, this Bill seeks to update the provisions relating to MUIS. Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether the existing section 32(7) can meet our intent to allow Mufti to testify where a case is made on false doctrine."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00731,2022-02-14-T-018,731,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Sections 32(7) and 139(2) are significantly different in their scope and effect under the AMLA. I think this was also referred to by Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00732,2022-02-14-T-018,732,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Section 32(7) is very wide, as it covers the question of Muslim law and it does not invoke any presumption in favour of the opinion provided by the Legal Committee, also known as the Fatwa Committee. It is also not restricted to a request from a Court, as it can be made by any person."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00733,2022-02-14-T-018,733,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On the other hand, section 139(2) of AMLA relates specifically to evidence required for an offence of false doctrine and currently invokes a presumption in favour of the evidence given by the President of MUIS. The amendment seeks to allow the Mufti, which is the highest Muslim religious authority in Singapore, to give evidence in lieu of the President of MUIS."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00734,2022-02-14-T-018,734,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Hence, the two sections have their own specific purpose under AMLA and the powers of the Legal Committee are not affected by the operation of section 139(2). More broadly, if the Court requests for the opinion of the Majlis on any question on Muslim law, section 32(7) would apply."
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00735,2022-02-14-T-018,735,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I also thank Mr Zhulkarnain Aabdul Rahim for his suggestion on section 114 of AMLA to make Mufti the reference for Muslim law questions on inheritance and succession. MUIS will study this suggestion.
2022-02-14-T-018-S-00736,2022-02-14-T-018,736,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to once again thank Members for their support of this Bill and their insightful comments. This Bill will help our Muslim institutions to better serve the community, improve legal processes, and strengthen the social support given to families and children. We will also continue to engage the community and religious fraternity to ensure that AMLA remains relevant for Muslims in Singapore. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move."

2022-02-14-T-020-S-00745,2022-02-14-T-020,745,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00746,2022-02-14-T-020,746,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my Adjournment Motion today focuses on transforming our preventive health efforts. In the view of some Singaporeans and healthcare workers I have spoken to, these efforts are not yet fighting-fit to take on some of the big health challenges of the near future and are already not delivering the health outcomes that we could be achieving for a well-developed nation."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00747,2022-02-14-T-020,747,Leon Perera,"By preventive health efforts here, I mean our policies and programmes for reducing the incidence of chronic disease conditions like diabetes, hypertension and so on, as well as our policies to move Singaporeans towards better health outcomes in general."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00748,2022-02-14-T-020,748,Leon Perera,"In this speech, I will detail proposals fitting into three overall thrusts."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00749,2022-02-14-T-020,749,Leon Perera,"One, we should adopt an outcomes-focused approach that is long term but given tough regular reviews. Two, we should reward the good health choices of individuals, especially at-risk groups. And three, we should use highly targeted strategies that nudge healthcare providers and leverage data towards better health outcomes."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00750,2022-02-14-T-020,750,Leon Perera,"But, first, let us take stock of our preventive health efforts and the huge health problems that we face."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00751,2022-02-14-T-020,751,Leon Perera,"Sir, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) was founded in 2001. Our spending on preventive healthcare efforts last year was about 5% of total non-COVID-19 MOH spending, with about $330 million allocated to HPB."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00752,2022-02-14-T-020,752,Leon Perera,"There are many worthy programmes that have been undertaken. For example, in public discussions of what the Government does to nudge Singapore towards living healthier lifestyles, the National Steps Challenge is often mentioned. However, what is the picture that emerges when we look at indicators of chronic conditions? We find that the incidence of certain dangerous chronic conditions has increased steadily in recent decades. Are we in danger of racking up an ""A"" grade for effort but a ""C"" grade for outcomes?"
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00753,2022-02-14-T-020,753,Leon Perera,"It is true that our mortality rates for cancer, stroke and heart disease have improved, perhaps owing to technological and economic factors. But as the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review does soberingly acknowledge, about one in three residents aged 40 to 69 has hypertension and two in five have high cholesterol."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00754,2022-02-14-T-020,754,Leon Perera,"Based on the last like-for-like comparison I could find, our 2015 diabetes prevalence among those aged 20 to 79 at about 11% is much higher than the OECD average of 7%."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00755,2022-02-14-T-020,755,Leon Perera,"In 2015, Singapore was number two in the world in diabetes prevalence. In fact, one in four Singaporeans aged 40 and above has at least one chronic disease. The proportion of older adults with three or more chronic diseases nearly doubled from 2009 to 2017. A 2017 MOH study showed that Singaporeans may have a longer life expectancy today but do not necessarily enjoy a better quality of health. Singaporeans born in 2017 are expected to spend on average 1.5 more years in poor health compared to those born in 1990 and this refers to the years spent on average in poor health, alive but in poor health."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00756,2022-02-14-T-020,756,Leon Perera,"Sir, these trends are likely to worsen if transformative intervention is not done. In 2017, an HPB expert noted that if obesity is not effectively curbed, Singapore could hit obesity rates of 15% in just seven years. That was the point at which obesity increased rapidly in the United States where it is now considered an epidemic."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00757,2022-02-14-T-020,757,Leon Perera,"According to a report by The Economist, cardiovascular diseases contribute to approximately one in three deaths in Singapore and levy about US$11 billion in costs on individuals, their households and the public finances. Modifiable risk factors for CVD, such as smoking and cholesterol levels, account for 60% of these costs."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00758,2022-02-14-T-020,758,Leon Perera,"In short, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a very big problem that needs to be tackled now with new thinking."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00759,2022-02-14-T-020,759,Leon Perera,I would like to make some policy recommendations to reverse these worrying chronic condition trends and get tough on preventive health.
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00760,2022-02-14-T-020,760,Leon Perera,"My first recommendation is that the Government should focus more clearly on outputs and outcomes. We should set clear goals for outputs like the proportion of persons exercising regularly, for example. We should also state clear short- and medium-term targets for lowering chronic disease incidence."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00761,2022-02-14-T-020,761,Leon Perera,"We cannot succeed if we do not define what success looks like. Meeting such targets is, of course, dependent on a range of factors and not only Government policies. This is clear and I do not disagree with this. We cannot, ultimately, micro-manage personal behaviour but we should know what are the short- and medium-term targets for outputs and outcomes that we are aiming at, so that we know when we are away from goodness."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00762,2022-02-14-T-020,762,Leon Perera,"It is useful to refer to participation rates for programmes and events, the number of app downloads and so on and so forth, but these, Sir, are effort indicators. We must not over-emphasise effort indicators in our public communications. Doing well on effort indicators can lull us into a false sense of security and self-congratulation. Rather, we should prioritise outputs and outcomes. These determine whether we have won or lost the battle. For instance, although it has been five years since Singapore declared war on diabetes, MOH said at the Committee of Supply last year that ""the prevalence of diabetes has not decreased"" from 2017 to 2020."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00763,2022-02-14-T-020,763,Leon Perera,"Furthermore, during this time, the prevalence of obesity, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol had risen."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00764,2022-02-14-T-020,764,Leon Perera,"Some types of efforts may not yield good outcomes. One example, HPB's ""1 Million kg Challenge"" in 2014 set a clear target of a collective weight loss of one million kilogrammes, from at least 300,000 participants over three years. The CEO of HPB has publicly acknowledged that they only managed to lose a few tens of thousands of kilogrammes. It is important to draw lessons from such experiences."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00765,2022-02-14-T-020,765,Leon Perera,"As an international example for comparison, I will cite the Nordic Plan of Action which sets specific ambitious targets for reducing obesity rates and improving physical activity levels and healthy diets, with a regular monitoring system every two years. While recent results in that part of the world have not been very good, at least there is a robust, transparent system, with targets and monitoring to drive towards the right outcomes."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00766,2022-02-14-T-020,766,Leon Perera,"Sir, let me go on to make some very specific policy recommendations."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00767,2022-02-14-T-020,767,Leon Perera,"Firstly, I would speak on rewarding good health choices. It is time to provide serious financial nudges to citizens to encourage healthy behaviours. First, we should provide some cash incentives or subsidies for MediShield premiums to those who demonstrate a commitment to healthier behaviours, such as regular screenings or regular exercise, as verified by way of attendance records or wearable technology, for example."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00768,2022-02-14-T-020,768,Leon Perera,"We have tried such schemes before, such as Lumihealth, the Apple watch tie-up, but we must put our money where our mouth is to ensure these schemes reach more people, in particular, those who are not yet exercising, eating well or going for their screenings. We can use various touch-points, like family doctors in whom many trust deeply, to spread the word."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00769,2022-02-14-T-020,769,Leon Perera,"There are examples of health insurers in other countries that provide premium discounts based on the adoption of behaviours that tend to make payouts for medical treatment less likely. For example, the US insurance provider Vitality provides premium discounts for members alongside freebies."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00770,2022-02-14-T-020,770,Leon Perera,I realise that this is a significant departure from the current approach. Further study should be done before adopting this as a general policy. The approach of testing a major policy through randomised controlled trials was also something I argued for when calling for smaller form class sizes in schools in an Adjournment Motion in 2017 and I have argued for this year as well.
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00771,2022-02-14-T-020,771,Leon Perera,"Next, let me turn to vaccines. In its GE 2020 manifesto, the Workers' Party called for making COVID-19 vaccines free, long before they had been successfully launched. This is something that most governments in the world have done, including Singapore's Government, and rightly so."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00772,2022-02-14-T-020,772,Leon Perera,"But the principle of making vaccines free can be extended. Other things being equal, higher vaccination rates have the potential to minimise disease incidence and, hence, reduce public and private expense in healthcare treatment for those diseases."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00773,2022-02-14-T-020,773,Leon Perera,"Sir, in the past, I have argued for making HPV free and added to the compulsory immunisation schedule for children. I also called for a bigger role for free vaccines in the public health system, rather than simply allowing MediSave to be used for vaccines. MediSave is, after all, our own money. Many Singaporeans are reluctant to touch it for something less tangible like a vaccine, fearing that they would need all the MediSave that they can get later in life for actual medical treatment. Vaccines have huge public benefits, as we have seen during COVID-19, so the Government should pay for them."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00774,2022-02-14-T-020,774,Leon Perera,"In 2020, the Government announced some improvements to subsidy levels for vaccines. I remember having an exchange in this House with then Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Amrin Amin, asking him if the subsidies for vaccines can be pegged to the amount of money the state would save from higher vaccination rates. He replied, saying they were crafting this package and would announce the details in time. I would like to repeat this call."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00775,2022-02-14-T-020,775,Leon Perera,"There is much more that can be done to improve vaccine take-up rates. Our take-up rate for flu vaccines, for example, is much lower than it should be, compared to some other developed countries. In a reply to my earlier Parliamentary Question, the Government acknowledged that our take-up rate for flu vaccinations of 24% among Singaporeans aged 65 and above is significantly lower than the equivalent rate of about 70% in Australia, the UK and the US."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00776,2022-02-14-T-020,776,Leon Perera,"According to one widely-cited figure, about 4,000 people in Singapore die from pneumonia and influenza every year. There is a great deal of suffering and costs involved in treating flu patients who become ill. Let us start with making flu vaccines free and thus easy to get for key groups like pregnant women, those with chronic health conditions and older folk over 65. Again, GPs can play a big role in promoting adult vaccination. This reasoning can also be applied to the pneumococcal vaccine."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00777,2022-02-14-T-020,777,Leon Perera,"Sir, even setting aside the toll in human suffering, which should be reason enough, if we calculate the cost, it could benefit the state to make such vaccines completely free, as this would save downstream fiscal expenditure like hospital subsidies. A healthier population is always worth investing in."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00778,2022-02-14-T-020,778,Leon Perera,"Sir, next, I would like to talk about health screening. Screen for Life (SFL) is a well-intentioned policy, but low take-up rates leave much to improve on. According to MOH's response to a Parliamentary Question I filed, 100,000 out of 1.8 million of eligible Singaporeans, or 5.6%, have benefited from SFL subsidies. By comparison, take-up rates of national health screening programmes are 22% in Japan and 30% in Taiwan, versus our 5.6%. Take-up is notably skewed towards the Chinese community, compared to other ethnic groups. Sir, I do acknowledge the Government's efforts to reach out to community groups to raise health screening take-up, including among minority communities. These are worthy efforts, but, clearly, the results still leave room for improvement."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00779,2022-02-14-T-020,779,Leon Perera,"HPB should conduct studies into the reasons for low take-up rates despite heavy subsidies for health screening under SFL. Anecdotally, lower-income constituents I have met will occasionally share that they do not wish to go for health screening as they are daunted by the high cost of treatment, or what they perceive to be the high cost of treatment, if disease is detected. If those who are most at risk of chronic diseases are not getting screened, this will not only incur greater downstream costs to the individual and the society, but also raise deeper questions about access to basic healthcare for the most vulnerable among us."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00780,2022-02-14-T-020,780,Leon Perera,"But, for now, I would like to offer some policy suggestions here on raising health screening take-up rates."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00781,2022-02-14-T-020,781,Leon Perera,"Firstly, as mentioned earlier, the Government could provide subsidies for MediShield Life premiums for those who regularly undertake health screenings. Some insurers, like NTUC Income, reward policyholders who have good health screening results with shopping vouchers. Sir, many studies prove that it is far cheaper to screen and to catch a disease early and slow down its progression."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00782,2022-02-14-T-020,782,Leon Perera,"In Singapore, one in three diabetics, one in four people with hypertension and almost half of those with high cholesterol levels do not know that they have these conditions. Those who do not know that they have these diseases will push up costs for everyone. I have called in a past Parliamentary Question for inclusion of waist circumference measurement in national health screenings. This metric is important in defining obesity risk, rather than over-relying on the Body Mass Index (BMI). I am glad that MOH is moving to implement this and I look forward to seeing more evidence-based inclusions in health screening."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00783,2022-02-14-T-020,783,Leon Perera,"Next, in nudging individuals towards healthier choices, I think it is important to place special attention on especially vulnerable groups, like the lower-income. Many lower-income Singaporeans lack the means to purchase and cook healthier foods. When I say this, of course, I do not mean that all healthy foods are costly, but many healthy food decisions are more expensive, complicated or time-consuming."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00784,2022-02-14-T-020,784,Leon Perera,"In providing aid to lower-income families, can some of our aid be provided in the form of highly frictionless digital currency earmarked for the purchase of healthier food products with, for example, less saturated fat and sugar? It could also focus on unprocessed foods like raw meat. A digital currency would be easily programmable and could be updated monthly to reflect inflation. With RFID technology in supermarkets and grocery chains, this should not be too difficult to do."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00785,2022-02-14-T-020,785,Leon Perera,"In the past, we have tried vouchers and other similar programmes, but if we could have a regular provision of frictionless aid, this would act as a much stronger nudge to eat healthily at home."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00786,2022-02-14-T-020,786,Leon Perera,"Sir, I also want to make a more philosophical point about helping the poor on health. Our preventive health programmes tend to place personal responsibility on individuals to take charge of their health and lead healthy lifestyles. However, we have a collective responsibility to ensure the less privileged among us also have access to healthy lifestyle habits and are supported in that direction. Health is a critical dimension in improving lives and livelihoods for poorer Singaporeans."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00787,2022-02-14-T-020,787,Leon Perera,"In reply to my earlier Parliamentary Question in 2020, MOH revealed that the life expectancy gap between those with post-Secondary and above education versus those with below Secondary education was 5.8 years, basically, six years. This is a shocking figure. Though it should be said that similar statistics can be found in other developed countries, at the 2021 Committee of Supply, then Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, remarked that MOH paid special attention to lower-income households, including their preventive health needs. This is a welcome assurance."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00788,2022-02-14-T-020,788,Leon Perera,"How effective, though, are the existing preventive health care programmes targeted at low-income groups such as Healthy Living Passport, KidSTART and Propel? Can we release more data on chronic disease prevalence and other health outcomes by gender, by socio-economic status? With more data, we can devise better programmes to nudge those on lower-incomes towards better health outcomes."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00789,2022-02-14-T-020,789,Leon Perera,"Next, I would like to talk about incentives for healthcare providers. Can we think of alternative models where there is a degree of incentivisation based on the success of the healthcare provider in nudging patients towards better health outcomes? In other words, instead of paying providers just for treating the sick, can we pay them in part, at least, for encouraging their patients not to get sick in the first place?"
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00790,2022-02-14-T-020,790,Leon Perera,"The notion is not as utopian as it seems. A few healthcare systems in the world are inching towards that. For example, Kaiser Permanente in California is well-regarded as a provider of high-quality, efficient and affordable integrated care. It is three separate entities  a health plan that bears insurance risk, medical groups of physicians and the hospital system. The financial incentive there is to provide a high-quality continuum of care and maximise population health, rather than profiting from a high volume of compensable services."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00791,2022-02-14-T-020,791,Leon Perera,"Can we thus remodel our system of healthcare providers to incorporate incentives for effective preventive health work with patients, rather than just rely on compensation to the healthcare provider being linked only to the performance of treatments and tests?"
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00792,2022-02-14-T-020,792,Leon Perera,One other specific example would be to empower healthcare providers with inter-operable IT systems that can flag out if a patient has not got a mammogram or a blood screening recently and direct the patient to get that done while they are visiting for something else entirely. This would be the medical equivalent of a no-wrong-door approach.
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00793,2022-02-14-T-020,793,Leon Perera,"Moving towards such an alternative system of compensation for healthcare providers is, indeed, a very big, some would say, radical idea. As always, piloting randomised controlled trials are all advisable. But the time to act is now."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00794,2022-02-14-T-020,794,Leon Perera,"Lastly, Sir, I would argue that we should make health data available more quickly and in more granular detail regarding chronic conditions."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00795,2022-02-14-T-020,795,Leon Perera,"Much of the data on disease incidence is not published so frequently and after a significant time lag from data collection. COVID-19 has shown that we can publish data on healthcare metrics practically in real time when the political will is there. It would help us to have public data on diabetes, say, quarterly, to ensure not only better public debate on healthcare policy, but also better alignment of outcomes and incentives to providers."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00796,2022-02-14-T-020,796,Leon Perera,"And on this note, I would like to ask if all Members of Parliament can be given data on chronic disease patterns and also other relevant indicators at the precinct level in their wards. It will help Members to know where there are concentrations of particular health issues, with a purpose of raising relevant talking points when we meet constituents and perhaps organising relevant ground events such as talks."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00797,2022-02-14-T-020,797,Leon Perera,"Can we conclusively move towards a system where a comprehensive data on a patient is easily and always available to healthcare providers, assuming permissions are given, of course? In fact, can we nudge patients to provide permission for data-sharing across healthcare providers? This would enable medical professionals to reduce duplication of tests and get a more holistic picture of every patient's health situation at any time."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00798,2022-02-14-T-020,798,Leon Perera,"Right now, data is available from the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR), but feedback is that the process of accessing it is not easy and not streamlined."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00799,2022-02-14-T-020,799,Leon Perera,"I would also suggest that the Government invest more in workforce automation of sorts for doctors, such that the IT system prompts them towards possible conditions the patient may have or alternative theories based on data analytics and AI."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00800,2022-02-14-T-020,800,Leon Perera,"The US NPO Kaiser Permanente, again, is widely recognised as having pioneered some world-class IT systems that help doctors do just that, suggesting to doctors that patients may have a certain condition in some cases, in the same way that Amazon prompts buyers by saying those who bought this book also liked this other book."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00801,2022-02-14-T-020,801,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, we are not faring well on many chronic disease indicators and this could portend worse to come. That would mean more human suffering and more pressure on our fiscal resources. When the costs of failing are socialised, as it is in this preventive health war, stronger action is justified."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00802,2022-02-14-T-020,802,Leon Perera,"The challenges we face in preventive healthcare are large, complex and defy any one magic bullet, but there are good ideas for change on the table, ideas that have been researched and put to the test academically and in the experience of other countries. The rewards for early, bold, decisive action can be tremendous. Our children and grandchildren will thank us for taking those actions today. So, let us do this today."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00803,2022-02-14-T-020,803,Deputy Speaker,Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon.
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00804,2022-02-14-T-020,804,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Leon Perera spoke about rethinking preventive health. I thank him for the suggestions that he has made. These are useful improvements that MOH will consider, but I would not describe them as a rethink of preventive health. In fact, improving preventive health has been on the agenda of MOH for many years now."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00805,2022-02-14-T-020,805,Koh Poh Koon,"In 2016, MOH put forth the Action Plan for Primary Care 2.0, to anchor the role of GPs in chronic disease management, a point which Mr Leon Perera has made, to make GPs the anchor. This, in fact, set the stage for the formation of Primary Care Networks (PCN) to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship in the management of chronic diseases. The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) was also enhanced to support the financing."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00806,2022-02-14-T-020,806,Koh Poh Koon,"In 2017, MOH announced our ""three Beyonds"" strategy  Beyond healthcare to health; Beyond hospital to community; and Beyond quality to value. Minister Gan Kim Yong, in his Committee of Supply 2017 speech, emphasised the importance of focusing on early interventions and healthy lifestyle choices to go ""Beyond Healthcare to Health"". And he further gave the example of how one front of the war on diabetes would be fought via healthy living and prevention, encouraging the population to stay active and eat healthy to reduce the risk of diabetes."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00807,2022-02-14-T-020,807,Koh Poh Koon,"At the MOH Workplan Seminar last year – which was his first public speech as Minister for Health – Minister Ong Ye Kung focused his speech on preventive care, emphasising how interventions should move and have moved upstream to tackle lifestyle risk factors for chronic diseases. In comments made during the Ministerial panel on Primary Care at the session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific held in October 2021, Minister Ong also shared that MOH was looking to change the system focus from acute hospital care back to preventive care provided in the community and primary care settings, which would result in a very good quality system that is also sustainable."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00808,2022-02-14-T-020,808,Koh Poh Koon,"Since then, we have been engaged in dialogues and in-depth discussions with our GP leaders and many in our Healthcare Cluster leadership. One of the things we discussed is on the possibility of a capitation model, to transform our primary care providers' way of engaging with our patients. So, MOH's big push to revamp preventive care in recent months is really no big secret. And we thank Mr Leon Perera for weighing in, and supporting this move, including providing some useful suggestions."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00809,2022-02-14-T-020,809,Koh Poh Koon,"Over the weekend, in fact, at the topping-out ceremony of the Woodlands Health Campus, Minister Ong Ye Kung said that he would be announcing a national programme focusing on preventive care at the coming Committee of Supply. So, I hope Mr Leon Perera and the Workers' Party Members will give it their full support at the Committee of Supply."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00810,2022-02-14-T-020,810,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Leon Perera suggested more subsidies and incentives to promote screening. His underlying assumption is that if we make things cheaper, in fact, make it free, the take-up rate will improve. But actually, having sat across the table with many patients, advising them on health screening, in preventive health, the hardest hurdle to overcome is the mindset and health beliefs of the individual. We all know what is good for us, health-wise. Every doctor counsels and wants his patients to go and do the right things for his own health. But, alas, in real life, changing mindset and health-seeking beliefs is not something that policy or clinical protocols alone can change."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00811,2022-02-14-T-020,811,Koh Poh Koon,"For example, the national Screen for Life (SFL) programme was introduced across more than 1,100 CHAS GP clinics to provide easy access to affordable and appropriate screening for eligible persons for cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, and also certain cancers, like cancers of the breast, cervix and colon/rectum. Eligible individuals pay no more than $5 for screening under SFL and MediSave can be used for approved screenings, including colonoscopy screening for colon cancer."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00812,2022-02-14-T-020,812,Koh Poh Koon,"In fact, based on the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) done in 2020, despite efforts to make screening accessible and affordable for all, cancer screening uptake rates remained between only 40% and 50% for each of these three cancers  cervical, breast and colorectal. This illustrates the point that despite efforts to reduce the cost barrier to screening, more still needs to be done to address the individual’s perceptions, their barriers, their fears, to undergo screening. We have to do more to nudge them to undertake screening."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00813,2022-02-14-T-020,813,Koh Poh Koon,"Vaccination is an important component of preventive health interventions, a point that Mr Leon Perera also made. In fact, all recommended vaccinations under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) are free for Singaporean children at polyclinics and CHAS GP clinics under the Vaccination and Child Development Screening Subsidies (VCDSS) as part of the Government's efforts to support marriage and parenthood and to encourage vaccinations on a cohort basis. So, Mr Leon Perera's call for free vaccination is already, in effect, being done."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00814,2022-02-14-T-020,814,Koh Poh Koon,"All adult Singaporeans are eligible for means-tested subsidies at both CHAS GP clinics and polyclinics for recommended vaccinations under the the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS). MediSave can also be used for any approved NAIS vaccinations, which means that co-payment could, in fact, be zero. And this includes influenza vaccination for our elderly."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00815,2022-02-14-T-020,815,Koh Poh Koon,"MOH also uses other touchpoints to increase adoption of these important vaccinations. For example, the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine that Mr Leon Perera talked about was actually introduced as a part of the school health programme in 2019 – a few years ago now. And all cohorts of Secondary 1 female students are offered the fully subsidised HPV vaccine in their respective schools. Fully subsidised means it is free. This is in addition to fully subsidised vaccinations provided as part of the immunisation schedule delivered in schools via HPB's School Health Service."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00816,2022-02-14-T-020,816,Koh Poh Koon,"MOH has also been working with our primary care partners to increase vaccination uptake, especially among seniors, for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Seniors are also able to learn more about the importance of vaccinations through interactive health workshops conducted within the community and through online platforms."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00817,2022-02-14-T-020,817,Koh Poh Koon,"Tackling preventive health requires an ""integrated"" as well as a ""life-course"" approach."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00818,2022-02-14-T-020,818,Koh Poh Koon,"Over the years, we have built a strong foundation in various key domains across different agencies  health promotion under HPB, health screening and chronic disease management by our GP clinics and polyclinics as well as our Healthcare Clusters, promoting sports and active lifestyle by Active SG and encouraging citizens to remain active in our Community Clubs and interest groups"
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00819,2022-02-14-T-020,819,Koh Poh Koon,"Having built up all these key pieces, we now move to enhance the delivery of evidence-based preventive health to the population by integrating them together."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00820,2022-02-14-T-020,820,Koh Poh Koon,"For example, the ""Health Up!"" initiative in Tampines, an initiative led by SingHealth polyclinics, in partnership with agencies, such as HPB, Changi General Hospital, Tampines GRC and SportSG, is a very good example of how the different stakeholders have come together to provide a holistic and structured health journey for residents by increasing awareness of healthy lifestyle habits and promoting appropriate screening for disease."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00821,2022-02-14-T-020,821,Koh Poh Koon,"With this integrative approach, a resident who undergoes health screening by the GP to determine the health parameters that needed improvement – could be his BMI, could be his blood control targets – can be subsequently assessed by a fitness coach under Active SG to customise a fitness regime targeting these particular goals. A structured exercise regime which also connects the resident with the Community Sports Club builds a network of peer support, friendships, peer groups, that eventually enables a sustained active lifestyle. Dietary counselling is also provided where needed. In fact, a Care Coordinator from Changi General Hospital serves as an ""account manager"" to help coordinate the health journey of the participant and helps transmit data, helps to coordinate the programme between the GP, the coach and the dietician."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00822,2022-02-14-T-020,822,Koh Poh Koon,"This entire process will be data-driven such that the GPs and the coaches have a shared view of the progress, participation and target goals that the individual has achieved. Suitable incentives and gamification can eventually be built into this process to further encourage and ingrain healthier habits."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00823,2022-02-14-T-020,823,Koh Poh Koon,"The ""Health Up!"" integrated approach aims to build an ecosystem within the community and centre around the individual so that this, hopefully, provides stronger support to encourage more upstream preventive health."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00824,2022-02-14-T-020,824,Koh Poh Koon,"MOH is also moving upstream to promote healthy lifestyle by adopting a life-course approach. Healthy habits start young – prevention is better than cure. HPB works with MOE and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to provide school health promotion initiatives and healthier food options for students in preschools and our schools. For the general adult population, our health promotion efforts include public education to increase health literacy and awareness of modifiable lifestyle risk factors for chronic diseases with health messages."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00825,2022-02-14-T-020,825,Koh Poh Koon,"Together with MOM and other partners, HPB also aims to improve the health of working adults by transforming workplace clusters into Healthy Workplace Ecosystems (HWEs) through partnering developers and key industry partners to deliver customised programmes to mature workers in seven priority sectors and the gig economy workers. Programmes are also offered directly to companies, including SMEs and mid- to large-sized companies and organisations. As of end December 2021, HPB has reached more than 1.24 million workers, with more than 213,000 workers participating in both virtual and face-to-face programme sessions."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00826,2022-02-14-T-020,826,Koh Poh Koon,"Today, doctors are supported by the National Electronic Health Records to access their patients' records for patient management. Singaporeans have access to own consolidated health records and eligibility for screening subsidies through Health Hub to empower self-management. We will also certainly leverage on technology and analytics to transform citizens' experience in health promotion programmes, moving from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to a more precise and personalised approach."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00827,2022-02-14-T-020,827,Koh Poh Koon,"LumiHealth, an example that the Member has quoted, was launched in 2020, is one such intervention that has empowered individuals to take charge of their health through precise and personalised insights and recommendations. The programme has encouraged participants to be more active, with their daily exercise minutes increased by over 39% when compared to the month before they started on the programme."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00828,2022-02-14-T-020,828,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, MOH conducts regular population health surveys and is able to examine health behaviours and outcomes of the different population segments. These reports are actually publicly available via the MOH website."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00829,2022-02-14-T-020,829,Koh Poh Koon,"While we have made progress over the years, the latest National Population Health Survey 2020 saw an increase in the prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and a reduction in the prevalence of Singaporeans with sufficient total physical activity and screening participation, partly due to the COVID-19 disruptions. There is a need to double up the preventive health efforts as we seek to regain the momentum and improvements that were lost due to the impact of COVID-19. There is an urgent need for the population to take action and participate in improving their health as we emerge from COVID-19."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00830,2022-02-14-T-020,830,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I urge all Singaporeans to play an active role in their own health journey by making sensible lifestyle choices and informed decisions. MOH, together with relevant stakeholders, will also continually refine our approach to preventive health to bring about a healthier Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00831,2022-02-14-T-020,831,Deputy Speaker,Order. The time allowed for the proceedings has expired.
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00832,2022-02-14-T-020,832,Deputy Speaker,"[(proc text) The Question having been proposed at 5.05 pm and the Debate having continued for half an hour, Mr Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order. (proc text)]"
2022-02-14-T-020-S-00833,2022-02-14-T-020,833,Deputy Speaker,Adjourned accordingly at 5.36 pm.
2022-02-14-T-021-S-00834,2022-02-14-T-021,834,Shahira Abdullah,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry has data on the prevalence of no-medical leave incentives and penalties across industries; and (b) whether such no-medical leave incentives or penalties contravene existing employment laws in Singapore.
2022-02-14-T-021-S-00835,2022-02-14-T-021,835,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of companies that give employees an attendance allowance provided they do not take medical leave; (b) whether the Ministry can consider mandating companies to suspend this practice and incorporate the ""attendance allowance"" into base pay, given public health concerns in the current COVID-19 climate; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry can consider further safeguards to ensure sick employees are not disincentivised to take medical leave when necessary."
2022-02-14-T-021-S-00836,2022-02-14-T-021,836,Tan See Leng,We do not collect data on the prevalence of attendance-related incentive schemes. Such schemes may have emerged over time as a way to help deter malingering and instil a more disciplined workforce.
2022-02-14-T-021-S-00837,2022-02-14-T-021,837,Tan See Leng,"While they may have been created with these outcomes in mind, the tripartite partners are of the view that attendance-related schemes that consider sick leave utilisation should no longer be seen as a reasonable or fair practice. As a matter of principle, if an employee is unwell, he should seek medical attention, firstly, for his own well-being, and secondly, for the well-being of his co-workers. To the extent that attendance incentive schemes discourage the taking of sick leave, even if unintentionally, it contradicts the overriding principle to protect the well-being of workers."
2022-02-14-T-021-S-00838,2022-02-14-T-021,838,Tan See Leng,"Today, the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) require employers to appraise and remunerate employees in a fair and objective manner, taking into consideration the employees' performance and contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, we will make clear that appraising or remunerating employees based on consumption of sick leave entitlement goes against this principle. The tripartite partners will clarify this point to all stakeholders."
2022-02-14-T-021-S-00839,2022-02-14-T-021,839,Tan See Leng,"The tripartite partners have been actively working with companies that have these schemes to restructure them into productivity and welfare schemes that do not take into account sick leave. Companies have made progress. For example, some have adjusted their schemes to provide wellness benefits, which contribute to employees' well-being and productivity at the workplace. MOM will also work with other trade associations and chambers to clarify the understanding of TGFEP. We will allow companies some time to review and make adjustments where necessary. Starting next year, it will be very clear that such schemes are contrary to TGFEP."
2022-02-14-T-022-S-00840,2022-02-14-T-022,840,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the recent announcement by NTUC Income to convert itself from an insurance co-operative to a corporate entity will have any impact on the affordability of insurance premiums going forward; and (b) whether workers will continue to have access to affordable insurance.
2022-02-14-T-022-S-00841,2022-02-14-T-022,841,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"When NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited (NTUC Income) was established in 1970, there were very few direct insurers. It filled a major gap  to provide affordable insurance to workers in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-022-S-00842,2022-02-14-T-022,842,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Singapore insurance market has since grown significantly, with more than 40 direct insurers today offering a wide range of retail insurance products. The insurance market today is also highly competitive. No single insurer dominates in terms of providing the most affordable or innovative insurance products. NTUC Income becoming a corporate entity should, therefore, not have an impact on the affordability of insurance products. NTUC Income has, on its own part, also said that it will remain committed to improving the financial well-being of Singaporeans via affordable and quality insurance solutions."
2022-02-14-T-022-S-00843,2022-02-14-T-022,843,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The best way to have affordable prices and wide choice of products is to ensure a vibrant and competitive industry. MAS will continue to promote this.
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00844,2022-02-14-T-023,844,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the considerations for extending the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix for another seven years; and (b) what are the overall benefits to Singapore.
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00845,2022-02-14-T-023,845,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) from 2008 to 2019, how much Government subsidies are provided to the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix; (b) what are the estimated economic benefits that arose from these 12 night races; (c) how much Government subsidy is expected to be provided for the 2022 Formula One Singapore Grand Prix; and (d) what are the estimated economic benefits despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation."
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00846,2022-02-14-T-023,846,Gan Kim Yong,"The Government decided to support the Formula One (F1) Singapore Grand Prix for another seven years, after thoroughly evaluating the costs and benefits that a term extension could bring to Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00847,2022-02-14-T-023,847,Gan Kim Yong,"The projected economic benefits to Singapore of the new term outweigh the costs to the Government. Similar to previous terms, the annual cost of organising the race for the next seven years is estimated to be between $135 million and $140 million. The Government will co-fund 60% of approved costs."
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00848,2022-02-14-T-023,848,Gan Kim Yong,"The race is expected to bring significant economic benefits to Singapore. Since 2008, the Singapore Grand Prix generated around $130 million in annual incremental spending from tourists attending the race. In addition, the race acts as a strong focal point for global Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) events and business meetings. With more than 30 MICE events clustered around the race each year, the Singapore Grand Prix has attracted more than 550,000 international visitors thus far."
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00849,2022-02-14-T-023,849,Gan Kim Yong,The race also brings global branding benefits to Singapore. The 2019 Singapore Grand Prix generated a media value of around $70 million to $75 million. It was watched by around 86 million television viewers globally. This was one of the highest global viewership of any international sporting event.1
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00850,2022-02-14-T-023,850,Gan Kim Yong,"The race also benefits the local business community. Ninety percent of the race organisation is sub-contracted to Singapore-based companies in the engineering, construction and hospitality sectors. Around 30,000 staff, contractors and stakeholders work at the Marina Bay Street Circuit for each race."
2022-02-14-T-023-S-00851,2022-02-14-T-023,851,Gan Kim Yong,"The first few years of the new term may reap lower economic benefits compared to previous years as international travel recovers from COVID-19. Nonetheless, I am confident about the longer-term appeal of the Singapore Grand Prix when international travel normalises. The extension will help sustain Singapore's reputation as a global city with a vibrant lifestyle and a hub for tourism and MICE events, support the recovery of our travel and tourism industry and generate business revenue and jobs for Singaporeans."
2022-02-14-T-024-S-00852,2022-02-14-T-024,852,Foo Mee Har,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) over the last two years, what is the number of fights amongst migrant workers taking place at dormitories; (b) what measures are in place to maintain law and order at dormitories; and (c) what protocols are in place for the Police's response so that tensions do not escalate."
2022-02-14-T-024-S-00853,2022-02-14-T-024,853,K Shanmugam,There were about 550 cases of hurt to persons that occurred in migrant worker dormitories from 2020 to 2021. These include cases of affray and rioting involving migrant workers.
2022-02-14-T-024-S-00854,2022-02-14-T-024,854,K Shanmugam,"Police work closely with the dormitory operators on safety and security issues. The operators are required, as part of licensing conditions under MOM, to put in place security arrangements, including access control measures, closed circuit television systems and deployment of security officers. Police also work with the operators to engage dormitory residents on crime prevention and safety and security matters."
2022-02-14-T-024-S-00855,2022-02-14-T-024,855,K Shanmugam,"When Police respond to calls for assistance at dormitories, the officers will assess the situation at the scene and take appropriate actions to preserve order. For instance, where tensions are high, the officers will physically separate the different parties."
2022-02-14-T-025-S-00856,2022-02-14-T-025,856,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what was the average weekly number of commuters between Singapore and Batam or Bintan before the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) what is the expected weekly number of commuters when Indonesia reopens Batam and Bintan to fully vaccinated Singaporean travellers; and (c) whether the Government will consider risk mitigation measures such as imposing an initial cap on the number of these commuters, to manage COVID-19 transmission risks."
2022-02-14-T-025-S-00857,2022-02-14-T-025,857,S Iswaran,"In 2019, the average number of ferry passenger arrivals and departures between Singapore and Batam and Bintan was about 146,000 a week in total."
2022-02-14-T-025-S-00858,2022-02-14-T-025,858,S Iswaran,"Since Indonesia opened up quarantine-free travel bubbles for fully vaccinated tourist travellers from Singapore to Batam and Bintan from 24 January 2022, the number of ferry passenger arrivals and departures has remained at around 600 per week."
2022-02-14-T-025-S-00859,2022-02-14-T-025,859,S Iswaran,"Singapore and Indonesia are working towards an arrangement to facilitate two-way quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated travellers between Singapore and Batam and Bintan, as part of our plans to gradually reopen borders while managing public health risks. We will share more details when ready."
2022-02-14-T-026-S-00860,2022-02-14-T-026,860,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development having regard to climatic changes leading to heavier and more frequent rainfall in Singapore (a) what support does HDB provide to address feedback from residents of HDB BTO estates about slippery and wet drop-off points, walkways and lift lobbies that were originally designed to make them naturally lit and ventilated; and (b) whether HDB is prepared to provide funding to Town Councils to make additions and alterations to such common property amenities affected by climatic changes."
2022-02-14-T-026-S-00861,2022-02-14-T-026,861,Desmond Lee,"HDB blocks are designed to allow for natural lighting and ventilation, while incorporating weather protection features. For example, there are canopies at common corridors for weather protection, floor screeding at lift lobbies and common corridors to reduce water ponding, and drop-down screens at drop-off points to block rainwater."
2022-02-14-T-026-S-00862,2022-02-14-T-026,862,Desmond Lee,"Despite the features, during heavy downpours, rainwater may splash into common areas, such as lift lobbies, common corridors and drop-off points. When HDB receives feedback from residents regarding excessive rainwater splashing near their unit, HDB will assess the extent of the splashing and provide a rain screen on a case-by-case basis, subject to SCDF's fire safety requirements to ensure that there is adequate open space and cross ventilation at the common corridor."
2022-02-14-T-026-S-00863,2022-02-14-T-026,863,Desmond Lee,"For new HDB blocks under design, HDB uses digital tools to simulate the effects of rain and wind, to help identify potential areas prone to rainwater splashing and adopt mitigating measures at an early stage. Additional areas and mitigating measures are also identified and taken during construction."
2022-02-14-T-026-S-00864,2022-02-14-T-026,864,Desmond Lee,"Should Town Councils receive feedback on common areas being wet and slippery, they may approach HDB and we will see how best to assist them."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00865,2022-02-14-T-027,865,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry has studied the potential impact of work-from-home legislation over the past two years on employers and employees, respectively; (b) if so, what are the results of this study; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry intends to conduct such a study and by when."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00866,2022-02-14-T-027,866,Tan See Leng,"We have not commissioned any study of the sort described by the Member, nor do we have plans to do so."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00867,2022-02-14-T-027,867,Tan See Leng,"We have not commissioned any study of the sort described by the Member, nor do we have plans to do so."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00868,2022-02-14-T-027,868,Tan See Leng,"Due to COVID-19, employers have adapted work practices and norms. In 2020, three in four employees worked in firms that provided some form of remote working. Our surveys also show that the majority of employers are keen to continue work-from-home arrangements for at least a quarter of the time, even after the pandemic ends. Moving forward, we expect work-from-home arrangements to become more mainstream. Employers see the value of work-from-home and other flexible work arrangements in talent retention and attraction, while employees enjoy the flexibility and experience better work-life balance."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00869,2022-02-14-T-027,869,Tan See Leng,"However, employers have also shared their concerns over the impact on staff engagement and effective collaboration, while employees are concerned over blurred work-life boundaries and the risk of burn-out."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00870,2022-02-14-T-027,870,Tan See Leng,"We will continue to work with tripartite partners to sustain the provision and use of flexible work arrangements, which include but are not limited to work-from-home. We will do so by addressing the challenges that employers have faced in implementing them. We will continue to promote implementation resources and tools, such as the Institute for Human Resource Professionals' Playbook on Hybrid Workplaces and the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces. These will help guide companies implement effective hybrid work arrangements and measures to support employees' well-being."
2022-02-14-T-027-S-00871,2022-02-14-T-027,871,Tan See Leng,"Even as we drive the adoption of flexible work arrangements, tripartite partners have stressed that we should not inadvertently erode trust at the workplace or create a litigious workplace culture by introducing overly rigid rules or rushing into legislation. We will continue to work with tripartite partners to support companies to provide FWAs in an effective and sustainable manner."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00872,2022-02-14-T-028,872,Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there are efforts to coordinate and oversee the various relief and fundraising efforts by local ground-up initiatives to help Malaysians affected by the recent floods to ensure that such efforts are conducted through trusted, reliable and accredited channels."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00873,2022-02-14-T-028,873,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"It is heartwarming to see many Singaporeans looking out for others in times of crisis and helping our neighbours affected by the recent floods. There are both organised efforts by charities, as well as informal ground-up efforts that are soliciting funds and in-kind donations to help Malaysians affected by the floods."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00874,2022-02-14-T-028,874,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Fund-raising activities are regulated by the Commissioner of Charities (COC). Anyone, including businesses and organisations, raising funds for foreign charitable causes is required to apply for a Fund-Raising for Foreign Charitable Purposes (FRFCP) permit from the COC prior to the commencement of the appeal. This ensures that donors' funds are channelled to the stated, bona fide purposes. You can check if an appeal has been granted a permit by using the Charity Portal's Fund-raising Permit search function."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00875,2022-02-14-T-028,875,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,There are registered charities in Singapore that provide humanitarian assistance to countries afflicted by disasters. The COC's Office works closely with these charities to facilitate the issuance of the FRFCP permit prior to the commencement of the appeal. We encourage members of the public to support the appeals organised by these charities or entities that have been granted the relevant permits. Such charities include the Singapore Red Cross.
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00876,2022-02-14-T-028,876,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"However, there are also informal appeals to give by individuals or loose groups who genuinely want to help. With the Internet and social media, it has become easy to conduct online appeals among friends or friends of friends and the wider community via online crowdfunding platforms. When responding to such appeals, it is important for donors to be discerning. For example, use crowdfunding platforms that have pledged commitment to the Code of Practice for Online Charitable Fund-raising Appeals which the COC has introduced. It is also important that donors check and ask the right questions before giving. For example, donors can ask the fund-raiser questions, such as who the beneficiary is, what their donations will be used for, and how they can receive updates about the beneficiary. Donors should check that the appeals are bona fide before giving. Members of the public can access the Charity Portal for more information on Safer Giving and trusted crowdfunding platforms."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00877,2022-02-14-T-028,877,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On our part, if there is reason to believe that a fund-raising appeal is fraudulent, the COC’s Office will investigate the matter. The COC can act to protect donors by invoking his powers to suspend, restrict or prohibit the conduct of the appeal."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00878,2022-02-14-T-028,878,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"While we do not intend for the regulatory regime to stifle the spontaneity of ground-up efforts to give help, we, nevertheless, encourage individuals or groups to partner and support charities who are familiar and have experience organising disaster relief efforts, to ensure that the funds raised will be channelled efficiently to the intended beneficiaries."
2022-02-14-T-028-S-00879,2022-02-14-T-028,879,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As donors, we, too, have a part to play. By being vigilant and discerning in responding to fund-raising appeals, we are better placed to ensure that our contributions will be put to good use."
2022-02-14-T-029-S-00880,2022-02-14-T-029,880,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health with the recent surge in cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant (a) whether any medical leave is given to public healthcare workers (i) who contract COVID-19, including time off from work for full recovery, and (ii) to care for affected family members; (b) if so, what are the respective numbers of days of medical leave given; and (c) what measures are in place to ensure that the healthcare system is not compromised when affected healthcare workers are on medical leave."
2022-02-14-T-029-S-00881,2022-02-14-T-029,881,Ong Ye Kung,Public healthcare workers follow the same MOM advisory on work and leave arrangements for employees who test positive for COVID-19.
2022-02-14-T-029-S-00882,2022-02-14-T-029,882,Ong Ye Kung,"Under these guidelines, those who are assessed by a doctor to be mildly symptomatic and of low risk will be given a 5-day medical certificate (MC) and advised to self-isolate at home for 72 hours. At the end of 72 hours, they can perform a self-test ART and choose to return to work if they are asymptomatic and the self-test result is negative. If they continue to test positive, they have to continue to self-isolate until they obtain a negative self-test result or until Day 7 (if vaccinated) or Day 14 (if unvaccinated) where Day 1 is the date of the first positive ART test. In addition, healthcare workers would be in appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for their work setting and follow the necessary workplace safe management measures. Healthcare institutions may deploy these recovered healthcare workers in lower-risk settings to minimise direct contact with seniors and vulnerable patients, or work in COVID-19 settings where there is no risk of reinfection."
2022-02-14-T-029-S-00883,2022-02-14-T-029,883,Ong Ye Kung,"While the majority of those who are infected are physically well or have mild symptoms, public healthcare workers who need to care for an affected child or elderly parent in self-isolation will be allowed to work from home (WFH). If work from home is not possible, staff may be granted unrecorded paid leave for the duration where the child or elderly parent is unwell."
2022-02-14-T-029-S-00884,2022-02-14-T-029,884,Ong Ye Kung,"To ensure that our healthcare system is not compromised, MOH is working closely with the public healthcare clusters to monitor the staff strength in each institution. Institutions may also adjust their internal manpower deployment across departments where feasible, depending on workload and staffing needs. MOH is also working in close partnership with private healthcare providers to help augment the capacity of our public healthcare system."
2022-02-14-T-030-S-00885,2022-02-14-T-030,885,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many cases of sexual harassment at workplaces have been reported in the past five years; and (b) what actions were taken in those cases.
2022-02-14-T-030-S-00886,2022-02-14-T-030,886,Tan See Leng,Workplace sexual harassment cases are dealt with by the Police and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).
2022-02-14-T-030-S-00887,2022-02-14-T-030,887,Tan See Leng,"Between January 2021 and September 2021, the Police handled 378 sexual harassment cases with a workplace nexus under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) and Penal Code. Police started to track such workplace harassment reports in 2021 to help MOM and TAFEP better understand the extent of this issue. Depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, Police may initiate investigations. Where investigations are not initiated, Police will advise the complainant to pursue civil remedies, such as applying for a Protection Order. Of the 378 cases, Police investigated 305 of them. As at 3 January 2022, 151 cases were still undergoing investigation. Of the 154 completed cases, 70 resulted in warnings and two in convictions."
2022-02-14-T-030-S-00888,2022-02-14-T-030,888,Tan See Leng,"For cases that may not meet the legal threshold for criminal investigations or civil recourse under POHA, but nonetheless result in distresses at the workplace, TAFEP will require the employer to provide an investigation report of the workplace harassment complaint in accordance with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment and take clear steps to prevent and manage workplace harassment in future. TAFEP will also work with the affected individual and the employer to adjust work arrangements and provide closure where relevant. Since the establishment of TAFEP's Workplace Harassment Resource and Recourse Centre in 2019, TAFEP has handled an average of 10 reports of workplace sexual harassment each year. Till date, all employers engaged by TAFEP to look into workplace harassment reports have been cooperative and have taken the necessary corrective measures in line with the Advisory."
2022-02-14-T-030-S-00889,2022-02-14-T-030,889,Tan See Leng,"The Government does not tolerate any form of workplace harassment, including sexual harassment. We urge any employee who has encountered workplace harassment to approach TAFEP or the Police for advice and assistance."
2022-02-14-T-031-S-00890,2022-02-14-T-031,890,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the reasons for the recent record high premiums of motorcycle COEs; (b) what can the Government do to moderate and bring down the premiums to more affordable levels; and (c) whether the Government is considering additional measures to help those who are impacted and dependent on their motorcycles for their livelihoods.
2022-02-14-T-031-S-00891,2022-02-14-T-031,891,S Iswaran,"The quota premium depends on the demand and supply for Certificates of Entitlement (COEs). As the supply of motorcycle COEs for each bidding exercise is predominantly dependent on how many motorcycles are deregistered in the preceding period, the recent high prices for motorcycle COEs reflect strong demand."
2022-02-14-T-031-S-00892,2022-02-14-T-031,892,S Iswaran,"Over the past year, more than 99% of motorcycle temporary COEs issued have been used to register motorcycles. This indicates there is real demand for these COEs, and there is little evidence of motorcycle dealerships and motorcycle-leasing firms bidding for excessive numbers of motorcycle COEs."
2022-02-14-T-031-S-00893,2022-02-14-T-031,893,S Iswaran,"We recognise that some workers rely on motorcycles for their livelihoods. This is why the Government subjects motorcycles to lower Additional Registration Fees, road taxes and ERP charges, compared to other vehicles types."
2022-02-14-T-031-S-00894,2022-02-14-T-031,894,S Iswaran,"We understand the concerns over the impact of higher COE prices on motorcycle owners who ride for a living. We are monitoring the situation closely and will take appropriate measures, if warranted."
2022-02-14-T-032-S-00895,2022-02-14-T-032,895,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what measures are in place to prevent discriminatory practice in the rental market of HDB flats to minorities; and (b) with newer HDB BTOs having a smaller number of units per precinct, how does this affect the ethnic integration policy quota percentage by block and neighbourhood."
2022-02-14-T-032-S-00896,2022-02-14-T-032,896,Desmond Lee,"For HDB flat rental transactions facilitated by property agents, CEA's regulatory guidelines require property agents to be sensitive to the multiracial, multi-religious and multicultural nature of Singapore's society. Property agents who fail to comply with these guidelines can be issued a written warning or be subject to disciplinary action which may result in financial penalties, suspension or revocation of their licence or registration."
2022-02-14-T-032-S-00897,2022-02-14-T-032,897,Desmond Lee,"Members of the public can lodge a complaint with CEA if they come across any potentially offensive or discriminatory advertisements by property agents. Nonetheless, the rental of residential properties in the open market is, ultimately, a private agreement between the property owner and the tenant. Similar to how a tenant has the freedom to choose his accommodation, a landlord has the right to decide whom he would like to rent his property to. While we have a framework that protects the rights of all Singaporeans, we cannot rely on the law in every instance and will need to continue to deepen mutual understanding and empathy across different groups to build mutual trust, respect and understanding in our community."
2022-02-14-T-032-S-00898,2022-02-14-T-032,898,Desmond Lee,The Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) limits are applied at the block and neighbourhood levels. These EIP limits do not differ according to the number of units in each precinct. The sale of all new BTO flats is also subject to the EIP limits to ensure that HDB neighbourhoods continue to have a balanced ethnic mix even as new projects are added to the neighbourhood.
2022-02-14-T-033-S-00899,2022-02-14-T-033,899,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Health since the revision of healthcare protocols from 11 October 2021, what is the number of (i) Health Risk Warnings (HRWs) issued, with the breakdown by cases which are identified by TraceTogether records, SafeEntry records and household member of a COVID-19 positive case, respectively and (ii) cases that subsequently tested COVID-19 positive after a HRW is issued."
2022-02-14-T-033-S-00900,2022-02-14-T-033,900,Ong Ye Kung,"Between 11 October 2021 and 31 January 2022, about 887,000 Health Risk Warnings (HRWs) were issued. Close to 60% were household contacts of COVID-19 positive cases, while the remainder were identified by TraceTogether, SafeEntry or other forms of contact tracing. The proportion of HRWs who eventually tested positive for COVID-19 was 10%. Household contacts are more likely to be infected than workplace or social contacts picked up by TraceTogether."
2022-02-14-T-034-S-00901,2022-02-14-T-034,901,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB will work out the estimated maintenance costs of the features and landscaping during the design of common property in BTO estates to ensure that it is within the average maintenance costs undertaken by Town Councils; (b) whether there is any consultation with the Town Councils for a better estimation of maintenance costs; and (c) whether these estimations may be published.
2022-02-14-T-034-S-00902,2022-02-14-T-034,902,Desmond Lee,"The designs and specifications for HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) projects, including the features and landscaping in common areas, do factor in considerations on sustainability and maintainability. For instance, for features in common areas, such as furniture and murals in community living rooms, HDB assesses the durability, ease of maintenance and cost of replacement when developing designs. As for landscaping, HDB considers the ease and frequency of maintenance and replacement when determining the planting design and choice of plant species. Irrigation systems are also provided for skyrise greenery to minimise downstream manpower costs and planting replacement costs."
2022-02-14-T-034-S-00903,2022-02-14-T-034,903,Desmond Lee,"Besides maintenance and cost considerations, HDB also takes into account the environmental and social benefits of the features and landscaping provided, to enhance the quality of living environment for residents. For example, in designing the landscaping in new HDB estates, HDB adopts biophilic design principles through incorporating natural elements, such as flora and fauna, as well as human interaction patterns, in its design to promote a greater sense of place and enhanced quality of life for residents. Similarly, roof gardens above Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCPs) are designed not just for aesthetic purposes, but as community spaces for residents to enjoy and to serve important environmental functions, such as reducing stormwater runoff from concrete roofs and reducing the urban heat island effort for a more comfortable living environment."
2022-02-14-T-034-S-00904,2022-02-14-T-034,904,Desmond Lee,"HDB consults Town Councils (TCs) on the choice of plant species, irrigation systems and any special features in new developments at multiple junctures, for instance, before calling for tender, commencing construction and/or after project launch. Hence, there are opportunities for TCs to surface potential maintenance issues upstream, so that they can be addressed at the design or construction stage. If TCs have further comments, HDB will review the design and make reasonable adjustments before handing over completed projects to the TCs. Upon project completion, HDB will also conduct site walks with TCs and, for developments with special features, brief TCs on how to maintain such features."
2022-02-14-T-034-S-00905,2022-02-14-T-034,905,Desmond Lee,"As TCs manage and maintain the common property in HDB estates, they would have their own estimates for the maintenance cost for typical common property items. HDB's estimates may not be reflective of the eventual costs borne by TCs as TCs might enjoy economies of scale as their maintenance contracts are typically grouped together in larger zones. To ensure that maintenance costs remain reasonable, HDB regularly reviews the design and provision of features and landscaping when new technology to aid maintenance becomes available and in response to Town Councils' feedback."
2022-02-14-T-035-S-00906,2022-02-14-T-035,906,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the COVID-19 Healthcare Award, or a similar award scheme, will be made available to cleaning staff in non-healthcare settings, to recognise their contribution to the national effort against COVID-19 as such workers bear the highest exposure risk outside of the healthcare field and are usually from lower-income backgrounds."
2022-02-14-T-035-S-00907,2022-02-14-T-035,907,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cleaning staff in both healthcare and non-healthcare settings have worked tirelessly to maintain public cleanliness and hygiene. We thank our cleaners for their hard work and contributions and will continue to take care of them as we emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic."
2022-02-14-T-035-S-00908,2022-02-14-T-035,908,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There are several existing awards to recognise the contributions of our cleaners. The Clean and Green Singapore (CGS) Awards have been organised annually since 2003, where outstanding cleaners working in the community are recognised with CGS Best Cleaners Awards."
2022-02-14-T-035-S-00909,2022-02-14-T-035,909,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To recognise the exceptional contributions of our frontline workers in the Environmental Services (ES) industry, the National Environment Agency has organised the ES Workforce Day annually since 2018 with the support of tripartite partners, including the Environmental Management Association of Singapore, the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore and the National Trades Union Congress. Exemplary individuals from the cleaning services sector are awarded the ES Star Award and Certificates of Excellence."
2022-02-14-T-035-S-00910,2022-02-14-T-035,910,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In addition, we will uplift the skills, wages and progression pathways of our cleaners through the Progressive Wage Model for Cleaning. With the six-year schedule of sustained wage increases released in May 2021 by the Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners, a General Cleaner can look forward to a monthly baseline wage of more than $2,400 by 2028, a 90% increase, compared to today."
2022-02-14-T-036-S-00911,2022-02-14-T-036,911,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Education for students affected by school closures and who are subsequently transferred to other schools, whether the Ministry can take into consideration the student's living arrangement and address of the student's primary caregiver prior to the school transfer."
2022-02-14-T-036-S-00912,2022-02-14-T-036,912,Chan Chun Sing,"Due to declining enrolment in some schools, MOE has merged schools rather than close them. The schools that are merged are usually located close to each other, and students from both schools would, as a norm, continue their learning in the merged school."
2022-02-14-T-036-S-00913,2022-02-14-T-036,913,Chan Chun Sing,"However, there have been instances of school transfer requests from some parents whose child is affected by school mergers. MOE will consider these requests, taking into consideration factors, such as the student's living arrangements, the address of the primary caregiver, the transportation challenges, the educational interests of the student, as well as available vacancies in the requested school."
2022-02-14-T-037-S-00914,2022-02-14-T-037,914,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information regarding subsidised home broadband Internet connectivity for low-income households (a) from 2020 to 2021, in how many cases were IMDA's documentation of approval issued via (i) hardcopy letter, (ii) digital document and (iii) both hardcopy and digital; (b) as of December 2021, how many participating Internet Service Providers required such hardcopy letter by IMDA to be provided by the applicant; and (c) what is being done to streamline application and activation processes."
2022-02-14-T-037-S-00915,2022-02-14-T-037,915,Josephine Teo,"Over 11,000 low-income households have been supported with subsidised broadband since IMDA's Home Access 3.0 programme was launched in April 2020. Since then, the application process has been streamlined to remove the need for applicants to submit supporting documents such as copies of applicants' NRIC and income."
2022-02-14-T-037-S-00916,2022-02-14-T-037,916,Josephine Teo,"Applications can be made virtually or via hardcopy application forms. In addition, all applicants may check their application and approval status on the online application platform, which requires a SingPass login. All successful applicants are also provided with hardcopy approval letters as an added form of approval confirmation."
2022-02-14-T-037-S-00917,2022-02-14-T-037,917,Josephine Teo,"Internet Service Providers (ISPs) require documentation of approval to verify successful applications before activating broadband services. This information is available to ISPs through IMDA's online system. Of the two participating ISPs, one, MyRepublic, offers applicants the option of activating the broadband service remotely by calling a hotline. The other ISP, M1, required successful applicants to present a hard copy letter of approval at their stores. This has since been removed and M1 will also be providing call-in as an additional channel for successful applicants to activate their services from March 2022."
2022-02-14-T-038-S-00918,2022-02-14-T-038,918,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether hybrid modes of working pose a risk of weaker oversight within the public service in areas, such as spending and financial governance; and (b) if so, what are the control systems that will be put in place to ensure proper oversight and governance of public service officers."
2022-02-14-T-038-S-00919,2022-02-14-T-038,919,Chan Chun Sing,"The Government remains committed to upholding high standards of governance and oversight, regardless of the mode of working. The Public Service has a range of controls and checks to safeguard financial processes and data, which will continue to apply in a hybrid work environment. We have also progressively enhanced our measures to ensure that hybrid work does not lead to higher risks in terms of financial controls."
2022-02-14-T-038-S-00920,2022-02-14-T-038,920,Chan Chun Sing,"Access controls are put in place to ensure proper governance. For example, public officers who work from home are only able to access central financial systems subject to their compliance with Government data protection and cyber-hygiene requirements. In addition, payment processes in the Public Service have been progressively automated with system controls. This means that invoices are received electronically from suppliers via the electronic invoicing network and this reduces manual handling of paper invoices and the risk of data-entry error by officers. To strengthen governance and oversight, agencies have also adopted network analytics to identify potential conflicts of interest in procurement. Post-disbursement, independent audits and data analytics are also performed to detect any anomalies and verify that funds were channelled appropriately to the intended beneficiaries."
2022-02-14-T-038-S-00921,2022-02-14-T-038,921,Chan Chun Sing,"As more public officers access systems remotely in a hybrid work environment, the Public Service has also put in place measures to foster a strong culture of cyber and data security. For example, all public officers are required to go through an annual cybersecurity awareness training. GovTech has published a set of best practices on measures that public officers should take to secure their home network and the secure use of video-conferencing tools when working from home. All agencies also have an Agency Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Data Officer who oversee and take charge of cyber and data security matters in agencies. All agencies are also required to engage independent internal or external auditors to conduct audits on ICT systems that are in operation."
2022-02-14-T-038-S-00922,2022-02-14-T-038,922,Chan Chun Sing,The Public Service will continue to make adjustments to enable hybrid work and continuously strengthen our systems and processes to ensure sound governance.
2022-02-14-T-039-S-00923,2022-02-14-T-039,923,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the Ministry's assessment of the Novavax vaccine; (b) whether the Ministry has found any data to support or reject its use for children below the age of 12; and (c) how will the Ministry encourage people who are skeptical about mRNA technology to take the Novavax vaccine if it is approved.
2022-02-14-T-039-S-00924,2022-02-14-T-039,924,Ong Ye Kung,This question will be answered in my reply to Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Yip Hon Weng in the next Sitting. [
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00925,2022-02-14-T-040,925,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) to date, what is the number of requests for exemption from Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures at the workplace; and (b) what are the Ministry's responses."
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00926,2022-02-14-T-040,926,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) for the workplace exist as subsidiary legislation; and (b) if so, why is the workplace VDS raised as subsidiary legislation without debate in Parliament."
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00927,2022-02-14-T-040,927,Tan See Leng,The Workforce Vaccination Measures are promulgated as subsidiary legislation under the Workplace Safety and Health Act. This was presented to Parliament on 12 January 2022.
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00928,2022-02-14-T-040,928,Tan See Leng,"It is an established practice in our system of governance that legislation commonly delegates to Ministers the power to make subsidiary legislation to address details that elaborate on the empowering Act. Many of our legislation, under the purview of all Ministries, provide for that."
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00929,2022-02-14-T-040,929,Tan See Leng,"Since the Workforce Vaccination Measures pertain to the health and safety of workers, it is within the power of the Minister for Manpower to set out these requirements as subsidiary legislation under the Workplace Safety and Health Act. Other requirements relating to COVID-19 management, such as group sizes and safe distancing, were promulgated as subsidiary legislation by the Minister for Health, under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act."
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00930,2022-02-14-T-040,930,Tan See Leng,"The Workforce Vaccination Measures facilitate the safe operation of businesses and minimise the risk to employees' health, by ensuring that employees who report to the workplace are fully vaccinated. In alignment with vaccination-differentiated measures in other settings, those who are medically ineligible for vaccination are not affected. They can continue to report to the workplace."
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00931,2022-02-14-T-040,931,Tan See Leng,"Employees who are medically eligible but unvaccinated are not granted exemptions, to protect them from being exposed to COVID-19 infection at the workplace. As outlined in the tripartite advisory on workforce vaccination measures, employers may redeploy these unvaccinated employees to suitable jobs that can be done from home, with the recognition that prolonged absence from the workplace may affect their individual performance and contributions, relative to other employees in the workplace. Employers may also place them on no-pay leave based on mutually agreeable terms. Termination of employment should be the last resort."
2022-02-14-T-040-S-00932,2022-02-14-T-040,932,Tan See Leng,We strongly encourage medically eligible but unvaccinated employees to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00933,2022-02-14-T-041,933,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Health what are the target criteria before COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and Singaporeans are allowed to dine and socialise normally again.
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00934,2022-02-14-T-041,934,Ong Ye Kung,"I will address this question along with Question No 39 for Written Answer on the Order Paper for 14 February 2022, and Mr Gerald Giam's Parliamentary Question filed for a subsequent Sitting."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00935,2022-02-14-T-041,935,Ong Ye Kung,"Members have asked if we can ease up on safe management measures and, specifically, to allow more social activities and groupings of more than five. As earlier indicated by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, once conditions permit, we will do so and, like most Singaporeans, I am looking forward to it."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00936,2022-02-14-T-041,936,Ong Ye Kung,Whether and when we can do so depends on the epidemic situation.
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00937,2022-02-14-T-041,937,Ong Ye Kung,"One aspect is the daily infection numbers, which are around 10,000 cases a day. The week-on-week infection growth rate is close to two. All these are within our expectations. As I have updated the House earlier, because Omicron is highly infectious, we should expect daily cases to reach 15,000 to 20,000, or even more."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00938,2022-02-14-T-041,938,Ong Ye Kung,"The top line daily infection number tells us where we are on the epidemic curve. But as we have emphasised before, what is more critical is its impact on disease severity and on our healthcare capacity."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00939,2022-02-14-T-041,939,Ong Ye Kung,"So far, the impact has been significantly more moderate for the Omicron variant, compared to the Delta variant. There are two reasons. One, Omicron is, inherently, a less severe variant compared to Delta, as it tends to infect the upper respiratory airways. Two, the high percentage of our population having received vaccinations and boosters. Today, we still observe a significant difference in incidence of severe illness amongst the vaccinated and boosted, and the not fully vaccinated, especially amongst seniors. So, vaccines continue to make a huge difference."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00940,2022-02-14-T-041,940,Ong Ye Kung,"Because of these reasons, while the daily infection numbers are high, the vast majority of cases have mild or no symptoms, and very few develop severe illness and require oxygen supplementation or ICU care or have passed away."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00941,2022-02-14-T-041,941,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me start with what concerns us most, which is deaths. During the peak of the Delta wave, from late October to early November 2021, we saw about 13 COVID-19 deaths a day. In the past two weeks, despite cases being three times more than during the Delta wave, we saw on average two to three deaths a day. But there had been days where deaths were also more than five. We have to watch the trend very closely, but, for now, the case mortality due to the Omicron variant is not very different from the number of deaths related to various viral infections pre-COVID. Prior to COVID-19, over 4,000 patients a year (or over 10 a day) passed on due to pneumonia, usually caused by infections."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00942,2022-02-14-T-041,942,Ong Ye Kung,"Next, ICU. Currently, about 0.05% (five in 10,000) of our COVID-19 cases ever required ICU care. At the peak of the Delta wave, about 170 ICU beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. Now, despite three times the daily caseloads, we have about 30 patients in the ICU across our hospitals. Of these, about 60% are intubated. Further, duration is also shorter, typically three to five days, compared to patients infected with the Delta variant, who would stay on average, 11 days."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00943,2022-02-14-T-041,943,Ong Ye Kung,"We have 113 ICU beds now and we can ramp up to 350 at short notice. This can be further stepped up to 500 ICU beds should the need arise. So, unlike during the Delta wave, the ICU wards are not coming under pressure and is in good shape."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00944,2022-02-14-T-041,944,Ong Ye Kung,"As for oxygen supplementation, about 0.3% of Omicron cases ever required it. Currently, we have around 130 patients who require oxygen supplementation, which is about 40% of the peak of the Delta wave. As cases rise, we expect this number to increase in parallel but with every hospital bed equipped with oxygen supply capability today, this is not a constraint."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00945,2022-02-14-T-041,945,Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, hospitalisation. There are about 1,200 COVID-19 cases who are currently hospitalised. Of these about 30% are ""incidental cases"". This means they are admitted for non-COVID-19 conditions and subsequently found to have COVID-19 during their stay because we test every patient. This group, typically, has no or very mild symptoms. In other words, they do not take up extra beds due to their infection. So, the extra workload on our hospitals is two-thirds of the 1,200 hospitalised cases. Further, most Omicron patients also have a short hospital stay of about three to four days, compared to five to eight days for patients infected with the Delta variant. It means beds are freed up faster."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00946,2022-02-14-T-041,946,Ong Ye Kung,"I would say hospital beds are probably the biggest constraint now. However, as symptoms of Omicron patients are often not very severe, there is a lot of scope for us to right-site the patients at COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) instead. Today, we have approximately 3,800 CTF beds and only a quarter are occupied. We also have plans to ramp up to approximately 4,600 beds by the end of February."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00947,2022-02-14-T-041,947,Ong Ye Kung,"So, looking at these indicators, our healthcare system is able to handle the Omicron wave. But beyond beds and equipment, we need to monitor the state of healthcare manpower. Our healthcare workers have been battling the pandemic at the frontlines for more than two years now. They have persevered through the Delta wave and are now fighting the Omicron wave. I want to convey my deepest appreciation to them."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00948,2022-02-14-T-041,948,Ong Ye Kung,"While our healthcare workers are very busy and stretched, it is a different level of intensity as during the Delta wave. Some countries have reported that their healthcare workers are resigning in droves. Here, the attrition rates of doctors from our public acute hospitals have remained comparable to 2019, before COVID-19 hit, about 3% to 5%. For nurses, the average attrition during the two COVID-19 years of 2020 and 2021 is about 8%, comparable to 2019. Absenteeism rate due to COVID-19 has been manageable and is about 2% now. We do not take this for granted, and will continue to support our healthcare professionals. We are also working closely with clusters to help them recruit new healthcare workers."
2022-02-14-T-041-S-00949,2022-02-14-T-041,949,Ong Ye Kung,"We will continue to monitor the key indicators closely to make sure our healthcare system can cope as we ride through the Omicron transmission wave. Once it has peaked and start to subside, we can look forward to easing our safe management measures."
2022-02-14-T-042-S-00950,2022-02-14-T-042,950,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the reasons for allowing groups of five unvaccinated persons to gather."
2022-02-14-T-042-S-00951,2022-02-14-T-042,951,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"From 1 February 2022, Religious Organisations (ROs) must implement Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) for all congregational and worship services at places of worship, which can involve up to 1,000 worshippers at a time, subject to Safe Management Measures and the safe capacity of the premises."
2022-02-14-T-042-S-00952,2022-02-14-T-042,952,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Under these prevailing measures, ROs can allow one group of no more than five persons at any one time to conduct private worship in the premises, regardless of vaccination status. They cannot mingle with other worshippers who are taking part in activities subjected to VDS, such as congregational worship services. Allowing unvaccinated individuals to gather only in very small groups reduces the risk of widespread transmission of the virus and severe health outcomes for the unvaccinated."
2022-02-14-T-042-S-00953,2022-02-14-T-042,953,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Faith communities support the national stance for vaccination and recognise the need to adopt VDS measures in religious activities in order to keep congregants safe. ROs have made important adjustments to their religious worship and activities to accommodate these measures. We appreciate the continued support from our ROs.
2022-02-14-T-043-S-00954,2022-02-14-T-043,954,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the number of infant care applications and the successful placement rates from January to December 2021; (b) what is the estimated projection of infant care applications for 2022 and whether there is adequate capacity; and (c) what are the Ministry's plans on infant care capacity.
2022-02-14-T-043-S-00955,2022-02-14-T-043,955,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As preschools manage their own processes for child and infant care enrolment into their centres, ECDA does not track their application and placement rates. Instead, ECDA tracks preschool interest registered by parents via the Preschool Search Portal (PSP) launched in 2019. Parents may register interest in as many as 10 preschools at the same time on the PSP. While we strongly encourage all parents to use the PSP, this is voluntary, and some parents may also directly contact their chosen preschools. In 2021, 830 parents of unenrolled infants registered interest for an infant care place via the PSP. This constituted 1% of all families with infants in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-043-S-00956,2022-02-14-T-043,956,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nationally, about 77% of infant care capacity was taken up by enrolled children in 2021. While the overall situation shows sufficient supply, there remain localised areas with waitlists. This could be due to several factors, such as parents preferring specific preschools or wanting preschool places close to their homes, and time needed for preschools to ramp up their infant care operations. While we are building new preschools closer to families, it is not always possible for families to have a preschool at the same block or within a few blocks of their homes."
2022-02-14-T-043-S-00957,2022-02-14-T-043,957,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Providing access to quality, affordable infant and child care remains a key priority for the Government. We will continue to increase capacity where needed to meet demand for early childhood services. By the end of 2022, ECDA will develop an additional 1,000 infant care places – offered largely by anchor operators and mainly in Planning Areas with upcoming HDB developments for new families. This does not include additional infant care places which may be developed by other preschool operators to meet local demand."
2022-02-14-T-044-S-00958,2022-02-14-T-044,958,Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether costs of business for the point-to-point sector for passenger transport have increased in the past two years; and (b) what are the largest components of these increases.
2022-02-14-T-044-S-00959,2022-02-14-T-044,959,S Iswaran,"The business costs of driving a taxi or private hire car typically include vehicle rental, commissions paid to platform operators as well as fuel cost, which are subject to global fuel price fluctuations. Compared to January 2020, overall costs of business for point-to-point (P2P) drivers have increased by about 6%. This is mainly due to a rise in fuel expenditure, as fuel prices have increased over the past six months. With the gradual recovery of P2P ridership, drivers have also made more trips and seen increased operating costs in recent months."
2022-02-14-T-044-S-00960,2022-02-14-T-044,960,S Iswaran,"Since February 2020, the Government has supported taxi and private hire car drivers through schemes, such as the Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) and COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund (CDRF). Currently, P2P ridership has recovered to nearly 80% of pre-COVID levels, bolstering drivers' incomes. We are glad that taxi operators have continued to support drivers with rental relief and will monitor the sector to ensure that drivers are coping well in this challenging period."
2022-02-14-T-045-S-00961,2022-02-14-T-045,961,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the current number and percentage of civil servants who are deemed to be unable to work from home based on their job functions; (b) whether these civil servants are eligible for flexible work arrangements (FWAs); and (c) if so, what do these encompass."
2022-02-14-T-045-S-00962,2022-02-14-T-045,962,Chan Chun Sing,"Some 60% of the Civil Service is in frontline functions, such as schools or the uniformed service agencies, which are not suited to be performed from home on a sustained basis."
2022-02-14-T-045-S-00963,2022-02-14-T-045,963,Chan Chun Sing,"However, where operationally feasible, Public Service agencies can exercise flexibility and discuss flexible work arrangements (FWAs) with these officers. These include part-time work arrangements and flexi-hours, which can support officers in balancing their work and personal circumstances."
2022-02-14-T-046-S-00964,2022-02-14-T-046,964,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether special covenant 2(1)(a) of the Memorandum of Lease to HDB's lease agreement can be enforced to prevent smoking near balconies or windows which persisted despite (i) advisories from the authorities, and (ii) efforts of the Community Mediation Centre (CMC); and (b) if not, what other conditions must be met before a case of smoking near balconies or windows will be considered a case of last resort where enforcing the special covenant is considered."
2022-02-14-T-046-S-00965,2022-02-14-T-046,965,Desmond Lee,"Enforcing the breach of a covenant under the lease agreement entails compulsory acquisition of the flat, as highlighted to the Member previously. This is a punitive measure that is not undertaken lightly. HDB exercises the right of compulsory acquisition sparingly and as a last resort. Moreover, should a flat be compulsorily acquired, the flat owners and occupants of the flat, such as their family members, will need to relocate and find a home elsewhere. If the underlying issues are not resolved, the issue will just be brought over to another community."
2022-02-14-T-046-S-00966,2022-02-14-T-046,966,Desmond Lee,"Hence, the approach to manage disamenities and disputes between neighbours is for neighbours to come together to try to resolve the matter amicably, with assistance by grassroots leaders or at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) where required. Where necessary, a Joint Advisory on Smoking in Homes will be issued by agencies to the residential unit reported to be emitting second-hand smoke, encouraging considerate behaviour and emphasising the negative impact that second-hand smoke may have on their neighbours."
2022-02-14-T-046-S-00967,2022-02-14-T-046,967,Desmond Lee,"In intractable cases, the affected neighbour may file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT). If the respondent is shown to have caused unreasonable interference to the affected neighbour, then the CDRT may make a range of orders against the respondent, including requiring the respondent to cease or refrain from carrying out certain acts."
2022-02-14-T-046-S-00968,2022-02-14-T-046,968,Desmond Lee,We will continue to study how we can better manage neighbour disputes arising from disamenities.
2022-02-14-T-047-S-00969,2022-02-14-T-047,969,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry can consider incentivising bus operators to offer cheaper, more flexible bus options to students as a way of encouraging more students to take school buses."
2022-02-14-T-047-S-00970,2022-02-14-T-047,970,Chan Chun Sing,Students are encouraged to use school buses or public transport to travel to and from school. This builds independence and inculcates environmentally sustainable habits in our students and also eases traffic flow around school zones.
2022-02-14-T-047-S-00971,2022-02-14-T-047,971,Chan Chun Sing,"The Government already has measures to help school bus operators keep their operating costs low, which, in turn, help to keep school bus fares low. For example, school buses are exempted from Certificate of Entitlement requirements. Private Hire and Excursion Bus operators who use their buses to provide school bus services are eligible for a 50% road tax rebate by the Land Transport Authority."
2022-02-14-T-047-S-00972,2022-02-14-T-047,972,Chan Chun Sing,"In addition, MOE provides a transport subsidy for students from lower-income families who take school bus or public transport. In particular, MOE subsidises 60% of the school bus fares for Primary school students receiving financial assistance."
2022-02-14-T-048-S-00973,2022-02-14-T-048,973,Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there has been an increase in the number of sound pollution and disturbance complaints in HDB estates over the past two years; and (b) whether the Ministry has conducted studies to understand how noise disturbances can be better managed by better building design and construction materials for new HDB estates.
2022-02-14-T-048-S-00974,2022-02-14-T-048,974,Desmond Lee,"In 2020, HDB received about 2,500 cases of feedback per month relating to noise from residents' activities, including renovation noise. Such feedback increased by about 25% in 2021 to 3,200 per month. The increase is likely due to work-from-home arrangements, coupled with the resumption of renovation activity in June 2020."
2022-02-14-T-048-S-00975,2022-02-14-T-048,975,Desmond Lee,"Over the years, HDB has made improvements in the construction materials used for better sound insulation. For example, since the mid-1980s, the walls between two flats are made with 100-millimetre reinforced concrete, instead of the hollow blocks used in older flats. In addition, for flats built since 1995, the floor slabs are made of at least 150-millimetre thick bare concrete, which provide better impact noise insulation, compared to the 125-millimetre bare concrete used in older flats. More recently, since February 2017, buyers of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats can also choose to have vinyl strip flooring in their bedrooms, which further reduces sounds from impact. These improvements help to reduce noise transmission within and between HDB flats."
2022-02-14-T-048-S-00976,2022-02-14-T-048,976,Desmond Lee,"HDB has also taken proactive design measures to minimise noise disturbances, such as situating or orientating HDB blocks away from noise sources and locating multi-storey car parks next to expressways to act as noise buffers."
2022-02-14-T-048-S-00977,2022-02-14-T-048,977,Desmond Lee,"HDB will continue to explore practical solutions to mitigate noise. At the same time, it is important for residents to do their part by showing consideration for their neighbours, such as by keeping the noise level down when going about their daily activities, especially late at night, so as to provide a pleasant living environment for all."
2022-02-14-T-049-S-00978,2022-02-14-T-049,978,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry will consider asking online service providers to insert advisories on all posts relating to illegal drugs on the harmful effects on potential users and the severe penalty that one will face in trafficking such drugs into Singapore.
2022-02-14-T-049-S-00979,2022-02-14-T-049,979,Josephine Teo,"Singapore adopts a strict policy of zero tolerance towards illegal drugs and deals with the drug problem through a comprehensive range of measures. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is an offence for persons to traffic in a controlled drug. It is also an offence for persons to import into or export from Singapore controlled drugs without authorisation. Persons who facilitate the sale or importation of controlled drugs via the Internet or other digital means may be liable for such offences."
2022-02-14-T-049-S-00980,2022-02-14-T-049,980,Josephine Teo,"When the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is alerted to websites that make illegal drugs easy to acquire in Singapore or promote illegal drug use, it will direct Internet Service Providers to block access to such websites under the Internet Code of Practice (ICOP). Social media platforms, generally, also have policies prohibiting the sale or promotion of illegal drugs. Users of those platforms may report such problematic content to the platform owner for review."
2022-02-14-T-049-S-00981,2022-02-14-T-049,981,Josephine Teo,"As part of Singapore's holistic drug control strategy, Government efforts to prevent access to illegal drug content are complemented by public education and awareness. Preventive drug education (PDE) remains the first line of defence in the Central Narcotics Bureau's (CNB) approach to enhance public awareness of the harms of drugs and to encourage a drug-free lifestyle. CNB has tailored PDE programmes for schools as well as those in positions of influence like parents, counsellors, educators, youth advocates and National Service commanders. They also receive informational toolkits to help them provide guidance or peer support to the youths. CNB also promotes anti-drug advocacy by like-minded individuals and community organisations. These efforts are crucial in galvanising public support for the anti-drug cause and in ensuring that the public is vigilant against online content relating to illegal drugs."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00982,2022-02-14-T-050,982,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health what are the plans beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to recruit and hire Singaporeans for jobs in healthcare and other healthcare-related sectors to ensure that future manpower capacity in these sectors is sufficient and sustainable.
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00983,2022-02-14-T-050,983,Ong Ye Kung,"MOH has always been committed to ensuring sufficient manpower in the healthcare sector. With an ageing population and rising prevalence of chronic diseases, we anticipate that the demand for healthcare services and, therefore, the demand for healthcare manpower will continue to increase. Over the years, even before the pandemic, we have established various schemes and programmes to attract and recruit local fresh graduates, mid-career individuals and mature workers as well as retain healthcare workers in the sector."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00984,2022-02-14-T-050,984,Ong Ye Kung,"Our local intakes for healthcare professional programmes remain healthy, with intakes increasing by 27% in the past 10 years, from around 2,700 in 2010 to 3,400 in 2020. We will continue to work with educational institutions to ensure an adequate training pipeline, supported by outreach and Education and Career Guidance to encourage students to consider a healthcare career."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00985,2022-02-14-T-050,985,Ong Ye Kung,"We also have our Healthcare Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) to support individuals in making a mid-career switch into professions, such as Nursing, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Diagnostic Radiography. Some of these are accelerated programmes, allowing eligible individuals to complete their training in a shorter time. We have seen an encouraging increase in interest in the CCPs over time. Between 2019 and 2021, we enrolled an average of around 180 mid-career locals per year into our healthcare CCPs, up from an average of 110 per year between 2016 and 2018."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00986,2022-02-14-T-050,986,Ong Ye Kung,"For the Community Care Sector, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has been working with community care organisations (CCOs) and recruitment partners like Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to attract and recruit more locals. In 2020, these efforts recruited about 900 locals for over 48 CCOs. In addition, AIC introduced a Senior Management Associate Scheme to facilitate the recruitment of mid-career locals for leadership and managerial roles in CCOs. Between 2017 and 2020, more than 150 mid-career locals had successfully transited into the community care sector, working as centre managers and human resource managers."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00987,2022-02-14-T-050,987,Ong Ye Kung,"Salaries play a key role in the attraction and retention of staff. We regularly monitor and review the salary competitiveness of our public healthcare institutions to ensure that they are competitive against the market. This also includes the review of starting salaries, to ensure that healthcare professions are attractive to students. In July 2021, a round of salary enhancements was rolled out for all nurses, allied health professionals, pharmacists, administrative and ancillary staff in both the public healthcare institutions and community care sector. We will do this carefully and reasonably, since increasing manpower and salaries also add to healthcare costs."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00988,2022-02-14-T-050,988,Ong Ye Kung,"Attrition and rising workload due to COVID-19 have been recent challenges, but we are determined to overcome them. We are encouraged that hiring into the public healthcare sector has remained strong and that people still do want to join healthcare. For example, the combined annual inflow of nurses and allied health professionals has increased, from 1,900 in 2018 to 2,300 in 2020. But we are a small country and there is a limit to recruitment for any one sector. So, this will continue to be a major challenge to address."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00989,2022-02-14-T-050,989,Ong Ye Kung,"Our public healthcare institutions rose to the challenge and have evolved their recruitment, hiring and deployment practices. For example, institutions have cross-deployed staff across professions and departments into areas of need, and leveraged volunteers and other short-term sources of manpower to further augment the workforce. We have also partnered private healthcare providers to ensure smooth delivery of healthcare services, including the running of Community Care Facilities and Community Treatment Facilities, and telemedicine consultation for home recovery patients."
2022-02-14-T-050-S-00990,2022-02-14-T-050,990,Ong Ye Kung,MOH will build on the lessons from COVID-19 and continue to work together with our stakeholders to secure sufficient manpower to meet our future healthcare needs.
2022-02-14-T-051-S-00991,2022-02-14-T-051,991,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the number and percentage of SingapoRediscover Vouchers (SRVs) redeemed at the end of 2021; (b) what is the percentage of SRVs that have been donated, unused and lapsed; and (c) what is the Ministry's assessment of the impact of SRVs on the tourism sector when assessed against the initial target set by STB to justify the creation of these SRVs."
2022-02-14-T-051-S-00992,2022-02-14-T-051,992,Gan Kim Yong,One hundred and eighty million dollars in vouchers were used by the end of the SingapoRediscovers Voucher (SRV) scheme on 31 December 2021. This constitutes 56% of the $320 million budgeted. The remaining funds from the unused vouchers will be used for other Government initiatives and priorities.
2022-02-14-T-051-S-00993,2022-02-14-T-051,993,Gan Kim Yong,Singaporeans donated close to $3 million of the $180 million vouchers redeemed. We thank Singaporeans for their kindness and generosity towards the various non-profit organisations and their beneficiaries in giving them the opportunity to rediscover Singapore as well.
2022-02-14-T-051-S-00994,2022-02-14-T-051,994,Gan Kim Yong,"The SRV was designed to help local tourism operators, guides and businesses, which have been the hardest hit during this pandemic, and, in the process, encourage Singaporeans to rediscover our island's inherent sights and charm. Collectively, SRV transactions generated about $300 million in voucher redemptions and out-of-pocket top-ups. The scheme also contributed close to $100 million in ancillary spending, such as retail, food and beverage, and transport. While the scheme has ended, we urge Singaporeans to continue supporting our local businesses and exploring our country, including our vibrant neighbourhoods and arts and heritage trails."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-00995,2022-02-14-T-052,995,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the reasonable staff to client ratio for Social Service Agencies (SSAs) under the Ministry's guidelines for MSF-funded programmes; (b) what happens when SSAs are unable to meet this ratio; and (c) for each year in the past five years, how many SSAs and what percentage of SSAs have been unable to meet this ratio respectively."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-00996,2022-02-14-T-052,996,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF funds about 90 Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to run about 50 different programmes. The staffing models of MSF-funded programmes consider staff-to-client ratios, which vary according to the nature of each programme."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-00997,2022-02-14-T-052,997,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Programmes catering to high-risk client groups, such as vulnerable persons in need of protection, would require a higher staff-to-client ratio. Other considerations include the complexity of client needs, the nature of intervention, such as whether it is a preventive programme requiring group psychoeducation or casework, and the intensity of intervention, such as whether it is a short treatment programme or a long-term maintenance programme."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-00998,2022-02-14-T-052,998,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, Family Service Centres (FSCs) are resourced based on the number of active cases, with higher funding given to cases with higher risks and complexity. FSCs have the flexibility to decide on the number of social workers to hire and how best to distribute cases among their social workers."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-00999,2022-02-14-T-052,999,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As at end-2021, about 15% of the headcount in the recommended staffing models across MSF-funded programmes was not filled by SSAs. The differences between actual hiring and the staffing models would differ across the programmes and the SSA providers for each programme."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-01000,2022-02-14-T-052,1000,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF also works closely with SSAs to monitor their staffing and ensure that they are adequately resourced. If SSAs face difficulty hiring, MSF will engage them to understand their hiring challenges and provide support where needed. For example, some SSAs may not have sufficient senior social workers to provide supervision and can tap on the Singapore Association of Social Workers' Supervision Service to enable their social workers who have yet to attain the requisite 1,000 supervised practice hours required for accreditation to receive supervision from a qualified supervisor."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-01001,2022-02-14-T-052,1001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, SSAs can tap on various initiatives under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package and the Transformation Support Scheme to support their hiring and capability-building efforts."
2022-02-14-T-052-S-01002,2022-02-14-T-052,1002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, MSF periodically reviews staffing models to ensure that client needs and service standards are met. This includes updating staffing models while taking into consideration reasonable caseload ratios to ensure clients are adequately served and staff have reasonable workloads."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01003,2022-02-14-T-053,1003,Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) how has the current trend of decreased popularity of multi-generational living, increasing trend of work and study from home and concerns for sustainable living, affected the design of future building developments; and (b) whether the Ministry will incorporate the use of solar energy, natural lighting and ventilation into the designs of new building developments to reduce the use of energy and water in homes and across the estate."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01004,2022-02-14-T-053,1004,Desmond Lee,"We take a holistic view towards providing a liveable, sustainable and quality environment for all to live, work and play in. We are also monitoring the evolving trends in society and the economy as we study how we can improve the planning and design of our built environment to future-proof our city."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01005,2022-02-14-T-053,1005,Desmond Lee,"As a major provider of public housing in Singapore, HDB has continually reviewed the design and layouts of HDB flats to keep pace with changing demographics, social trends and lifestyle needs, including concerns over sustainable living."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01006,2022-02-14-T-053,1006,Desmond Lee,"HDB continues to build and offer a wide variety of flats to cater to different household sizes and budgets. For example, HDB offers different flat types from 2-room Flexi to 3-Generation (3G) flats to cater for different lifecycle needs."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01007,2022-02-14-T-053,1007,Desmond Lee,"HDB flats are also designed to give residents flexibility to reconfigure the space in their homes to meet their needs, including working from home. For example, columns in new flats are pushed to the edges, where possible, to better accommodate changes in layout."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01008,2022-02-14-T-053,1008,Desmond Lee,"To promote and enable sustainable living, HDB has embarked on various initiatives to develop estates that provide eco-friendly and smart features. For new developments, these include solar-ready roofs for easier installation of solar panels and rainwater harvesting system to reduce the usage of potable water. For existing towns, through the Green Towns Programme, we have introduced initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption, recycling rainwater and cooling HDB towns."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01009,2022-02-14-T-053,1009,Desmond Lee,"BCA requires new building developments with a gross floor area of 5,000 square metres or more to achieve at least 50% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 baseline levels and meet other environmental sustainability requirements. Developers and building owners can meet these requirements by adopting designs that facilitate natural ventilation and the use of natural lighting and installing renewable energy solutions, such as solar photovoltaic systems."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01010,2022-02-14-T-053,1010,Desmond Lee,"BCA's Green Mark scheme recognises buildings that exceed the minimum environmental sustainability requirements. For example, the Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy certification recognises buildings that achieve at least 60% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 baseline levels and demonstrate exemplary standards in other aspects of sustainability, such as maintainability and climate resilience. Buildings that meet these standards enjoy the benefits of reduced energy and water consumption and, hence, reap net savings over their lifecycle."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01011,2022-02-14-T-053,1011,Desmond Lee,"Under the Built Environment Transformation GFA Incentive Scheme, URA will grant up to 3% additional GFA to private developments that meet the Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy standards, among other requirements. In addition, all new public sector buildings and all developments on Government Land Sales sites launched from 2Q 2022 onwards will also be required to meet these standards."
2022-02-14-T-053-S-01012,2022-02-14-T-053,1012,Desmond Lee,We will continue to engage Singaporeans and study new planning concepts and design ideas to support the evolving needs of our residents and contribute to a more sustainable future.
2022-02-14-T-054-S-01013,2022-02-14-T-054,1013,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for National Development whether any further steps will be taken to rein in the escalating prices of HDB resale flats.
2022-02-14-T-054-S-01014,2022-02-14-T-054,1014,Desmond Lee,"In December 2021, the Government announced a set of measures to cool the private residential and HDB resale markets. Specific to HDB flat buyers, the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit for housing loans from HDB was reduced from 90% to 85%. For those taking housing loans from the financial institutions, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) threshold was also reduced from 60% to 55%. These measures are intended to encourage greater financial prudence among homebuyers, providing an additional buffer against potential income reductions or interest rate increases."
2022-02-14-T-054-S-01015,2022-02-14-T-054,1015,Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, we recognise that there is, currently, strong demand for public housing from homeseekers. This strong demand is partly driven by marriage and family formation, and changing social norms and aspirations having resulted in a growing trend of smaller households. This may also possibly be fueled by COVID-19-related factors, such as the construction delays caused to both private and public sector construction projects, including BTO projects."
2022-02-14-T-054-S-01016,2022-02-14-T-054,1016,Desmond Lee,"To meet the strong demand for public housing, the Government has also announced alongside these cooling measures that we will ramp up the BTO supply to launch up to 23,000 flats per year in 2022 and 2023. The BTO supply for 2022 and 2023 is an increase of 35% from the 17,000 flats launched in 2021. For new and ongoing BTO projects, we strive to keep waiting times as short as possible without compromising safety and quality, and have rolled out extensive measures to help contractors complete their ongoing projects in a timely manner. These measures will need time to take effect and we will monitor the market closely. We are prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, if needed. We will calibrate this based on prevailing demand."
2022-02-14-T-054-S-01017,2022-02-14-T-054,1017,Desmond Lee,"Taken together, the suite of demand and supply measures will support a stable and sustainable property market in the medium-term. The Government will continue to monitor the housing market conditions closely to ensure that housing remains affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans, especially for those planning to purchase their first home."
2022-02-14-T-055-S-01018,2022-02-14-T-055,1018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider (i) calibrating current Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) quotas by country and its rationale for doing or not doing so, and (ii) setting separate sales caps and quotas for VTL (Land) as compared to VTL (Air) quotas."
2022-02-14-T-055-S-01019,2022-02-14-T-055,1019,S Iswaran,We have implemented quotas for the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) as a safeguard to manage the public health risk.
2022-02-14-T-055-S-01020,2022-02-14-T-055,1020,S Iswaran,"For VTL (Air), the quota is allocated to airlines operating flights from VTL countries based on the plans they submit. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) manages the quota allocation for each country and airline dynamically based on demand, and the total will be kept within the overall quota."
2022-02-14-T-055-S-01021,2022-02-14-T-055,1021,S Iswaran,"For VTL (Land) with Malaysia, the quota is set separately from VTL (Air) and is based on the number of designated buses entering each country per day."
2022-02-14-T-056-S-01022,2022-02-14-T-056,1022,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what design standards are in place to ensure future-ready carparks can support electric vehicles (EVs); and (b) whether there is any plan to institute insurance for building protection for HDB properties in case of explosions from EVs or any electric charging mobility systems.
2022-02-14-T-056-S-01023,2022-02-14-T-056,1023,S Iswaran,MOT is studying measures to ensure that new developments provide sufficient electrical capacity for EV charging and will announce details when ready.
2022-02-14-T-056-S-01024,2022-02-14-T-056,1024,S Iswaran,"Where safety is concerned, EVs and their charging equipment, like hybrid vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, are subject to stringent safety standards before they are approved for use. All EVs must comply with internationally-recognised vehicle safety standards, such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulations. Similarly, all EV charging equipment must be compliant with our national charging standard, Technical Reference 25, before they can be installed and used. LTA and other relevant agencies regularly review these standards to ensure their relevance and effectiveness. The Fire Code was also revised in September 2021 to include specific fire safety requirements relating to EV charging stations. LTA requires all EV charging operators in public carparks to obtain and maintain public liability insurance to insure against any third-party losses or damages arising from the provision of EV charging infrastructure."
2022-02-14-T-057-S-01025,2022-02-14-T-057,1025,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the recent developments on the transplant of animal organs in humans, whether the Ministry will consider establishing a framework to deal with medical ethical issues arising from such transplants in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-057-S-01026,2022-02-14-T-057,1026,Ong Ye Kung,"Locally, there have been no cases where animal organs have been used for human transplantation. This is a form of xenotransplantation, which is currently not regarded as standard treatment internationally."
2022-02-14-T-057-S-01027,2022-02-14-T-057,1027,Ong Ye Kung,"There remain multiple barriers to the clinical application of xenotransplantation, such as graft rejections and risk of infections from donor animals. As it is still considered experimental, xenotransplantation, if done locally, should only be done in the context of pre-clinical or clinical studies, until there is robust evidence supporting its long-term safety and clinical efficacy."
2022-02-14-T-057-S-01028,2022-02-14-T-057,1028,Ong Ye Kung,"As there may be social and ethical issues involved, should such research on xenotransplantation be carried out locally, it must adhere to existing ethical safeguards for the conduct of clinical studies, such as the requirement for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval."
2022-02-14-T-057-S-01029,2022-02-14-T-057,1029,Ong Ye Kung,"MOH will monitor developments overseas, and study the need for additional governance as well as the attendant socio-ethical concerns, should the procedure be considered for approval in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-058-S-01030,2022-02-14-T-058,1030,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether styrofoam is used in the making of aeration holes in open car park lots and, if so, why; (b) whether more sustainable alternative materials have been considered; and (c) whether there are plans to phase out the use of styrofoam and, if so, by when."
2022-02-14-T-058-S-01031,2022-02-14-T-058,1031,Desmond Lee,"HDB currently constructs its surface car parks using cast in-situ reinforced concrete slabs for durability and maintainability. Styrofoam moulds are utilised to achieve the planting voids in the design of the slabs, which allows grass to grow and helps reduce the heat generated by the concrete surface."
2022-02-14-T-058-S-01032,2022-02-14-T-058,1032,Desmond Lee,"These moulds are of food grade quality and are produced by licensed factories. After usage, the moulds are removed from site for proper disposal by registered disposal companies as general waste in accordance with the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95)."
2022-02-14-T-058-S-01033,2022-02-14-T-058,1033,Desmond Lee,"HDB has also been exploring different construction methods to achieve greater sustainability. As part of these efforts, HDB has piloted an alternative surface car park design that does not utilise styrofoam moulds. The pilot has been successful and HDB will be adopting the new design as and when the existing surface car parks are progressively upgraded."
2022-02-14-T-059-S-01034,2022-02-14-T-059,1034,Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the status of investigations into the recent SMS phishing scams on bank account holders; and (b) what are the steps that the regulatory authorities intend to take to prevent and mitigate such scams from reoccurring in the future.
2022-02-14-T-059-S-01035,2022-02-14-T-059,1035,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the lessons learnt from the recent SMS phishing scams targeting banks; and (b) how can rapid digitalisations within the financial sector be achieved without compromising security against potential frauds and scams.
2022-02-14-T-059-S-01036,2022-02-14-T-059,1036,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"These questions will be addressed as part of the three Ministerial Statements to be delivered by Minister for Finance and Deputy Chairman of MAS, Lawrence Wong; Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation & Cybersecurity, Josephine Teo; Minister of State for Home Affairs, Desmond Tan, at tomorrow's Sitting."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01037,2022-02-14-T-060,1037,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether an update can be provided on the Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) project; (b) whether the involved public agencies have arrived at a unified consensus on privacy and data management to enable them to benefit from the shared data for the project; (c) if not, which agencies have reservations and what is being done to address them; (d) when will the project be rolled out on a large-scale basis; and (e) how will the public benefit from the project."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01038,2022-02-14-T-060,1038,Teo Chee Hean,"The Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) project was started in late 2017 to explore the technical and business feasibility of using lampposts to mount sensors. The project is organised into two trials to cover brownfield and greenfield site use cases in commercial, industrial and residential environments."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01039,2022-02-14-T-060,1039,Teo Chee Hean,"Later this month, GovTech will complete the first trial of LaaP, which covers commercial and industrial brownfield sites in Geylang and One-North. The second trial, in the residential greenfield site in Punggol Northshore estate, will start in April 2022."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01040,2022-02-14-T-060,1040,Teo Chee Hean,"With the near completion of the first trial, GovTech has assessed that the mounting of sensors on lampposts is technically feasible and has also established the various cost components and drivers. GovTech has developed a lamppost infrastructure design that converts a normal lamppost into a shareable LaaP that can accommodate multiple sensors. This is important as agencies deploying sensors in the same locations can share the same LaaP infrastructure and avoid duplicating the resources and time to set up their own infrastructure. However, we will start to retrofit all lampposts only when suitable large-scale use cases with cost-effective benefits can be identified. These use cases can then form the anchor demand to roll out LaaP more widely."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01041,2022-02-14-T-060,1041,Teo Chee Hean,"The second trial in Punggol Northshore, a greenfield site, will give GovTech more information on the business and technical feasibility of LaaP. Greenfield sites without any pre-existing lampposts, present the opportunity to design and build a new integrated LaaP that is more compact and durable by having the cables and equipment housed inside the lamppost casing, as opposed to being on the exterior under the retrofitted design. We are also testing other use cases in residential areas, such as monitoring playground activities within housing estates, so that residents may feel more assured of playground safety."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01042,2022-02-14-T-060,1042,Teo Chee Hean,"The approach for LaaP will be decided after GovTech completes the evaluation in 2023, together with the completion of the trial. Internationally, other cities are also still testing smart lampposts or deploying them on a very limited scale. We have not seen any city-wide implementation of smart lampposts that can mount multiple types of sensors yet."
2022-02-14-T-060-S-01043,2022-02-14-T-060,1043,Teo Chee Hean,"Sensor data collected in public spaces under the LaaP project may be shared across public agencies. Such sharing of data is governed by the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) and the Government Instruction Manual on Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems Management. The PSGA sets out the purposes under which public agencies may share data with each other. The PSGA criminalises the unauthorised disclosure and improper use of information. Individuals who are found guilty of doing so are liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000, or imprisonment of up to two years, or both. The Instruction Manual sets out how public agencies and officers should manage and protect data, including personal data."
2022-02-14-T-061-S-01044,2022-02-14-T-061,1044,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Prime Minister whether he can provide an update on (i) the status of the investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in respect of the Singaporeans involved in the Keppel Offshore & Marine (KOM) corruption case since the requests for Mutual Legal Assistance have been sent out and (ii) the actions which have been taken against responsible individuals to date.
2022-02-14-T-061-S-01045,2022-02-14-T-061,1045,Indranee Rajah,"The Keppel Offshore and Marine case is complex and transnational in nature, involving multiple foreign authorities and several more potential witnesses based overseas. We have requested further Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) from foreign authorities to obtain additional information from these witnesses and are still awaiting the response to these requests. How quickly and to what extent our requests will be acceded to are dependent on the foreign authorities to which the requests were made."
2022-02-14-T-061-S-01046,2022-02-14-T-061,1046,Indranee Rajah,CPIB will spare no effort to complete the investigations against the individuals involved.
2022-02-14-T-062-S-01047,2022-02-14-T-062,1047,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what plans are taken to render humanitarian or financial aid to our neighbouring countries which have been affected by the recent floods or natural disasters; and (b) what are the international efforts in developing technology or other measures to prevent or mitigate the environmental or economical effects of such disasters in the future.
2022-02-14-T-062-S-01048,2022-02-14-T-062,1048,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Two of our close neighbouring countries recently suffered from natural disasters. Heavy downpours pounded Malaysia in December 2021 and early-January 2022, leading to flooding in parts of Kuala Lumpur and nine other states. Malaysian media reported that at least 54 people had been killed and over 70,000 victims evacuated to relief centres. The floods have since receded and disaster relief is ongoing."
2022-02-14-T-062-S-01049,2022-02-14-T-062,1049,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Typhoon Rai made landfall in the southern and central regions of the Philippine archipelago on 16 December 2021. The Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported 409 deaths and over 1,350 injured, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicated that around 1.2 million people in the Philippines were affected by Typhoon Rai, with an estimated 488,000 people displaced. Military aircraft and naval vessels were deployed for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance operations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched an emergency appeal for 20 million Swiss francs (US$21.7 million) to fund relief and recovery efforts."
2022-02-14-T-062-S-01050,2022-02-14-T-062,1050,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The floods in Malaysia and Typhoon Rai in the Philippines resulted in the loss of many lives and widespread destruction of property, causing hardship and suffering to the affected communities. As a fellow ASEAN member state, Singapore stands by Malaysia and the Philippines during this difficult time. I wrote to my counterparts – Dato' Sri Saifuddin Abdullah and Secretary Teodoro L Locsin Jr – to express condolences and to offer any assistance they may require. The Singapore Government also contributed US$60,000 on 22 December 2021 as seed money to support the Singapore Red Cross' (SRC) public fundraising to aid disaster relief and recovery efforts in Malaysia and the Philippines. The funds raised by the SRC will focus on emergency healthcare, first aid assistance, as well as distribution of relief supplies, such as hygiene kits and shelter tool kits, to evacuation centres. The contribution by the Singapore Government supplemented the SRC's pledges of US$50,000 each to the Malaysian Red Crescent and the Philippine Red Cross."
2022-02-14-T-062-S-01051,2022-02-14-T-062,1051,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to natural disasters. Regional and international cooperation is important to prevent or mitigate the impact of natural disasters. For example, ASEAN Member States developed the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) to enhance our region’s collective response to natural disasters. In 2021, ASEAN launched the AADMER Work Programme 2021-2025, which aims to enhance and support disaster risk reduction and management capabilities, including through inter-sectoral cooperation, capacity building, resource mobilisation and stronger coordination among ASEAN Member States. UN agencies like the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) also work with governments and communities on disaster risk reduction and prevention, which are important to help countries build a more resilient future."
2022-02-14-T-062-S-01052,2022-02-14-T-062,1052,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore will support such regional and international efforts where we can. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has put its humanitarian assistance and disaster relief team on standby for deployment, should there be requests for support from our ASEAN counterparts. SCDF also works closely with the United Nations OCHA Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to monitor the disaster situation in the region. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, we conduct courses on disaster management and disaster risk reduction through the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) and with international partners, such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and UNDRR. For example, Singapore has partnered the UNDRR on an annual course on disaster risk reduction since 2015. We have conducted seven runs of the course for 252 participants from 82 countries and international organisations to date. Singapore will continue to work with regional and international partners to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from disasters in the future."
2022-02-14-T-063-S-01053,2022-02-14-T-063,1053,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for each year of the past three years, what is the (i) number of missing persons, with the breakdown by age group, ethnicity and income level and (ii) proportion of vulnerable missing persons out of the total number of missing persons; (b) what is the Police's current approach in preventing and identifying missing persons; and (c) whether the Police will consider implementing additional measures to prevent and locate missing persons."
2022-02-14-T-063-S-01054,2022-02-14-T-063,1054,K Shanmugam,"There were 5072 missing persons reported to the Police over the past three years, from 2019 to 2021. Of these, about 15% were vulnerable persons, such as young children and elderly persons."

2022-02-14-T-063-S-01056,2022-02-14-T-063,1056,K Shanmugam,"When Police receive a report on a missing person, investigations will be conducted to locate the person. Police will interview the person who lodged the report to establish background facts pertaining to the missing person, such as the state of his/her mental health and the circumstances under which he/she was last seen. Police will also disseminate lookout messages for the missing person to all Police resources, especially those within the particular area where the missing person is reasonably believed to be."
2022-02-14-T-063-S-01057,2022-02-14-T-063,1057,K Shanmugam,"Police will accord priority to vulnerable missing persons as they may be at higher risk. These include young children, elderly persons, and persons with intellectual disabilities, such as dementia."
2022-02-14-T-063-S-01058,2022-02-14-T-063,1058,K Shanmugam,"In addition, Police have established procedures with other Government agencies to get their help to locate missing persons. For example, Police will make enquiries with other Government agencies, such as education institutions, hospitals and MSF. Police may also issue appeals for information to seek the public's assistance."
2022-02-14-T-063-S-01059,2022-02-14-T-063,1059,K Shanmugam,We welcome further suggestions to locate missing persons more effectively.
2022-02-14-T-064-S-01060,2022-02-14-T-064,1060,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last three years, what is the number of Personal Mobility Device (PMD)-related fires; (b) how many of these fires involve unlicensed PMDs; and (c) how is SCDF working with LTA and other agencies to reduce the number of PMD-related fires."
2022-02-14-T-064-S-01061,2022-02-14-T-064,1061,K Shanmugam,"There were 102, 42 and 32 fires involving PMDs in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Most of these fires involved unregistered PMDs, which accounted for 66, 26 and 24 fires in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively."
2022-02-14-T-064-S-01062,2022-02-14-T-064,1062,K Shanmugam,"SCDF and LTA co-chair the inter-agency Active Mobility Fire Safety Taskforce. The task force has successfully reduced the number of PMD-related fires over the past years through public education and regulatory controls. For example, the task force encourages the disposal of unregistered PMDs. It works with community partners to broadcast safety messages and conducts targeted outreach with industry stakeholders. In addition, LTA has prohibited the use of unregistered PMDs on public paths, introduced an inspection regime for PMDs and banned the import of non-compliant PMDs into Singapore, except for certain legitimate uses, such as research or re-export. The task force will continue to work with its partners to further reduce PMD-related fires."
2022-02-14-T-065-S-01063,2022-02-14-T-065,1063,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what proportion of mobile phone users in Singapore are currently using the ScamShield app; (b) to date, what percentage of scam calls and SMSes have been successfully blocked by the app; (c) why is the app not available to Android users; (d) when will the app be available to Android users; and (e) what plans are there to step up public education to encourage residents to install the app."
2022-02-14-T-065-S-01064,2022-02-14-T-065,1064,K Shanmugam,"This question will be addressed as part of the three Ministerial Statements to be delivered by the Minister for Finance and Deputy Chairman of MAS, Lawrence Wong; the Minister for Communications and Information & Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation & Cybersecurity, Josephine Teo; and the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Desmond Tan, at tomorrow's Sitting."
2022-02-14-T-066-S-01065,2022-02-14-T-066,1065,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Law (a) to date, how much has been spent by the Government on the Legal Technology Platform Initiative (LTPI); and (b) what are the targets for the take-up rate amongst lawyers upon the launch of the LTPI."
2022-02-14-T-066-S-01066,2022-02-14-T-066,1066,K Shanmugam,"The Legal Technology Platform (LTP) is a legal matters management tool that offers integration with commonly-used legal technology solutions, such as for document management, practice management and so on. The Ministry is working with a technology provider on the integration of its base platform with these solutions, as well as Singapore-specific features that are co-developed with the industry. Through this initiative, law firms can look forward to greater convenience, seamlessness and support in their journey of technology adoption, enabling them to more efficiently and effectively manage their matters digitally."
2022-02-14-T-066-S-01067,2022-02-14-T-066,1067,K Shanmugam,"The Government has set aside about $11 million for the first two phases of development of the Singapore-specific features of LTP and its integration with commonly-used solutions. The project is currently in the first phase of development and about half of this amount has been incurred to date. Beyond the development cost, the Ministry is exploring grants to defray the subscription cost of LTP and selected LTP-integrated solutions for the early adopters. The LTP is expected to be launched in the second quarter of this year, after the first phase of development is complete."
2022-02-14-T-066-S-01068,2022-02-14-T-066,1068,K Shanmugam,"The LTP aims to onboard 1,300 users from small and medium-sized Singapore law practices within the first three years of its launch. Past legal technology initiatives have shown that it will take time to generate sufficient industry take-up. We will continue to work with the industry after launch to improve the platform and add more features in the second phase of development."
2022-02-14-T-067-S-01069,2022-02-14-T-067,1069,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Law in the past five years (a) what is the annual number of applications for legal aid that have been received by the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB); (b) of these, how many applicants are successful; and (c) what is the percentage of unsuccessful applicants who do not pass the means test."
2022-02-14-T-067-S-01070,2022-02-14-T-067,1070,K Shanmugam,"LAB provides legal advice, legal assistance and legal aid on civil matters, to Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents with limited means. LAB receives an average of 8,500 applications each year – slightly more than half are for legal advice and assistance, and the remaining for legal aid."
2022-02-14-T-067-S-01071,2022-02-14-T-067,1071,K Shanmugam,"Applicants for legal advice or legal assistance have to pass the means test. Applicants for legal aid have to pass both the means test and legal merits test. Unsuccessful applicants may fail the means test or legal merits test, or both."
2022-02-14-T-067-S-01072,2022-02-14-T-067,1072,K Shanmugam,The information on the applications LAB received between 2017 and 2021 are provided in the table below.

2022-02-14-T-068-S-01074,2022-02-14-T-068,1074,Don Wee,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider tiered electricity pricing for residential households, with progressively higher prices for subsequent tiers, to encourage households to use electricity more efficiently."
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01075,2022-02-14-T-068,1075,Gan Kim Yong,"To encourage households to use electricity efficiently, electricity should be priced to reflect its full cost of production and delivery. This is our current approach, under which households pay for what they consume."
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01076,2022-02-14-T-068,1076,Gan Kim Yong,"Tiered electricity pricing may have inadvertent implications. For example, a multi-generational family will have to pay a higher rate if they live under the same roof versus living in separate homes."
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01077,2022-02-14-T-068,1077,Gan Kim Yong,We encourage households to use electricity more prudently in other ways
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01078,2022-02-14-T-068,1078,Gan Kim Yong,"(a) SP Services has been progressively replacing households' analogue (cumulative) electricity meters with advanced electricity meters, which allow households to track their electricity consumption through the SP Utilities Mobile App. This will help households better understand their electricity usage patterns and encourage them to be more energy-efficient."
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01079,2022-02-14-T-068,1079,Gan Kim Yong,(b) NEA provides online resources to help households to adopt energy-saving habits. Households can also use the online Life Cycle Cost Calculator to select the most energy-efficient home appliances based on their life-cycle costs.
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01080,2022-02-14-T-068,1080,Gan Kim Yong,"(c) NEA and PUB launched the Climate Friendly Households Programme in November 2020 to encourage 1-room to 3-room HDB households to switch to energy- and water-efficient appliances. Each eligible household can redeem e-vouchers to offset their cost of purchasing LED lights, energy-efficient refrigerators and water-efficient shower fittings."
2022-02-14-T-068-S-01081,2022-02-14-T-068,1081,Gan Kim Yong,"We encourage all Singaporeans to adopt energy conservation as a way of life – from designing an energy-efficient home, to choosing energy-efficient appliances and adopting energy-saving habits."
2022-02-14-T-069-S-01082,2022-02-14-T-069,1082,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many travel agency licences have been revoked due to the failure to meet the $10,000 financial asset requirement for a licensee that is a sole proprietor, partnership or an unincorporated association in Regulation 9 of the Travel Agents Regulations 2017; (b) what factors does the Ministry consider in fixing this requirement; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider reducing the minimum financial requirement further in light of the uncertain global travel outlook."
2022-02-14-T-069-S-01083,2022-02-14-T-069,1083,Gan Kim Yong,"The minimum financial requirement is imposed to ensure that travel agents have the financial means to fulfil their commitments to customers. With the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, MTI reduced the minimum financial requirement for travel agents holding a general licence to $10,000 to ease the cashflow of travel agents, which saw a sharp drop in business. Given the prolonged nature of the pandemic, MTI extended the reduced minimum financial requirement till the end of 2022."
2022-02-14-T-069-S-01084,2022-02-14-T-069,1084,Gan Kim Yong,"Since the minimum financial requirement was reduced in 2020, no travel agent licences have been revoked due to a failure to meet the minimum financial requirement."
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01085,2022-02-14-T-070,1085,Rachel Ong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the supply of natural gas from Indonesia to Singapore has resumed to normal levels; and (b) whether the recent Memorandum of Understanding on Energy Cooperation between Indonesia and Singapore will extend Indonesia's supply of natural gas to Singapore beyond 2023.
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01086,2022-02-14-T-070,1086,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what has been the volume of piped natural gas (PNG) supply from Indonesia in each month since January 2021 and how does it compare with the volume in January 2022; (b) how many unplanned curtailments of PNG have occurred since August 2021; and (c) what steps are being taken to improve the reliability of Singapore’s gas supplies from Indonesia.
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01087,2022-02-14-T-070,1087,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore imports PNG from Malaysia and Indonesia via our PNG importers, Gas Supply Pte Ltd, Keppel Gas Pte Ltd, SembCorp Gas Pte Ltd and Senoko Energy Pte Ltd. Gas supply contracts are negotiated on a commercial basis, and continued supply depends on, among other factors, availability of gas in the fields."
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01088,2022-02-14-T-070,1088,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore's PNG supply from Indonesia comes from two regions, West Natuna and South Sumatra. The contracted volumes for the PNG contracts are revised annually. Because of depletion of these gas fields, the quantum is gradually reduced. The reduction in supply from Indonesia will be replaced by new PNG contracts or alternative sources of gas, such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). The quantum of decrease of PNG supplies is commercially sensitive, as it will affect the PNG importers' negotiations for replacement fuel. Our LNG terminal has sufficient capacity to serve all gas demand in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01089,2022-02-14-T-070,1089,Gan Kim Yong,"In addition to the planned depletions, there were also instances of unplanned curtailments to our PNG supply from Indonesia. Due to upstream production issues in the West Natuna gas fields that caused a temporary reduction in output, we experienced a prolonged unplanned curtailment between 6 September 2021 and 26 December 2021. Gas supply from West Natuna has since resumed at contractual levels. Occasional low gas landing pressure from South Sumatra also resulted in unplanned curtailments from October 2021 to December 2021."
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01090,2022-02-14-T-070,1090,Gan Kim Yong,"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has been working closely with PNG importers and key gas users in Singapore to better manage the balance of gas supply and demand. These include  (a) ensuring that generation companies have the option to switch from gas to backup fuels. This improves the gas system stability and avoids the need for more extensive gas curtailments. Since putting this in place on 1 January 2022, there has been no further need for gas curtailments; and (b) imposing new Standards of Performance on PNG importers to ensure that they are proactive in ensuring reliable PNG supply."
2022-02-14-T-070-S-01091,2022-02-14-T-070,1091,Gan Kim Yong,"The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Energy Cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia was signed in January 2022 and is focused on low-carbon energy development, such as in the development and financing of low-carbon energy infrastructure, cross-border electricity trading and the development of new and emerging technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). The MOU will pave the way for commercial collaborations in these areas of interest and enable both countries to work together on energy transitions while supporting regional decarbonisation."
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01092,2022-02-14-T-071,1092,Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what measures will be taken to secure submarine infrastructure built for the import of renewable energy from Indonesia to Singapore, specifically from damage and disruptions to submarine cables from maritime activities in regional waters."
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01093,2022-02-14-T-071,1093,Gan Kim Yong,"Importing low-carbon energy will be a key strategy in Singapore's energy transition in the near to medium term. In October 2021, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced that Singapore plans to import up to four gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will constitute around 30% of our electricity supply."
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01094,2022-02-14-T-071,1094,Gan Kim Yong,EMA will put in place the following measures to safeguard supply reliability.
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01095,2022-02-14-T-071,1095,Gan Kim Yong,"First, electricity import proposals will be evaluated by EMA and international experts to ensure that the import projects are designed with a high level of security and reliability."
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01096,2022-02-14-T-071,1096,Gan Kim Yong,"Second, penalties for supply disruptions and excessive restoration time will be imposed on electricity importers. This incentivises importers to enhance protection of the submarine cables, such as by providing additional redundancies in the form of extra cables, ensuring that there is regular maintenance and inspection of the cables, and expediting the repair of damaged cables to minimise disruptions to electricity supply. Within Singapore waters, it will also be an offence to damage any submarine electrical cable under section 85A of the Electricity Act."
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01097,2022-02-14-T-071,1097,Gan Kim Yong,"Third, we will provide onshore backups, including energy storage systems and combined-cycle gas turbines, in the event of a protracted disruption."
2022-02-14-T-071-S-01098,2022-02-14-T-071,1098,Gan Kim Yong,EMA has also been working with importers on small-scale electricity import trials which will allow EMA to refine the technical and regulatory frameworks to ensure the security and reliability of large-scale electricity imports into Singapore in future.
2022-02-14-T-072-S-01099,2022-02-14-T-072,1099,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the projected annual Government expenditure on subsidy for hosting the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix from this year to 2028.
2022-02-14-T-072-S-01100,2022-02-14-T-072,1100,Gan Kim Yong,"The Government decided to support the Formula One (F1) Singapore Grand Prix for another seven years, after thoroughly evaluating the costs and benefits that a term extension could bring to Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-072-S-01101,2022-02-14-T-072,1101,Gan Kim Yong,"The projected economic benefits to Singapore of the new term outweigh the costs to the Government. Similar to previous terms, the annual cost of organising the race for the next seven years is estimated to be between $135 million and $140 million. The Government will co-fund 60% of approved costs."
2022-02-14-T-072-S-01102,2022-02-14-T-072,1102,Gan Kim Yong,"The race is expected to bring significant economic benefits to Singapore. Since 2008, the Singapore Grand Prix generated around $130 million in annual incremental spending from tourists attending the race. In addition, the race acts as a strong focal point for global Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) events and business meetings. With more than 30 MICE events clustered around the race each year, the Singapore Grand Prix has attracted more than 550,000 international visitors thus far."
2022-02-14-T-072-S-01103,2022-02-14-T-072,1103,Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, the race brings global branding benefits to Singapore. The 2019 Singapore Grand Prix generated a media value of around $70 million to $75 million.1 The race also benefits the local business community by generating business revenue and jobs for Singaporeans."
2022-02-14-T-073-S-01104,2022-02-14-T-073,1104,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the Ministry's assessment of the resilience of startups in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic and how they are positioned to grow in 2022 onwards.
2022-02-14-T-073-S-01105,2022-02-14-T-073,1105,Gan Kim Yong,"On the whole, startups in Singapore remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first nine months of 2021, startups raised $11.2 billion, more than double the $5.5 billion raised in the whole of 2020, and up from $8.5 billion in 2019 before the pandemic."
2022-02-14-T-073-S-01106,2022-02-14-T-073,1106,Gan Kim Yong,"In 2021, there were eleven new Singapore-based tech unicorns, which are privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion, almost equal to the total number of unicorns produced in Singapore over the past seven years. This brings the total number of Singapore-based startups that reached unicorn status to 22."
2022-02-14-T-073-S-01107,2022-02-14-T-073,1107,Gan Kim Yong,"Despite current global challenges, the growth outlook for Singapore-based startups continues to be optimistic. Singapore is well-positioned as the leading startup and innovation node in Southeast Asia. The region offers growth opportunities, driven by favourable demographics and accelerated digitalisation."
2022-02-14-T-073-S-01108,2022-02-14-T-073,1108,Gan Kim Yong,"Today, startups in Singapore have access to over 200 global and local accelerators, up from about 120 accelerators five years ago. The number of early-stage venture capitalists (VCs) has also increased by about a third, from about 130 in 2016 to close to 180 today."
2022-02-14-T-073-S-01109,2022-02-14-T-073,1109,Gan Kim Yong,"The Government is committed to supporting research and innovation. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 masterplan, or RIE2025, the Government will invest $25 billion to anchor Singapore's positioning as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. Enabled by the strong innovation ecosystem, Singapore is starting to see more deep tech startups gain traction and secure venture capital interest. Investments into deep tech startups in Singapore for the first nine months of 2021 are 2.6 times that of the same period in 20201."
2022-02-14-T-074-S-01110,2022-02-14-T-074,1110,Foo Mee Har,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the number of Singaporeans and permanent residents currently working overseas in innovation and technology hubs in the US, Europe and Asia."
2022-02-14-T-074-S-01111,2022-02-14-T-074,1111,Gan Kim Yong,"In 2021, there were 179,500 Overseas Singaporeans"
2022-02-14-T-075-S-01112,2022-02-14-T-075,1112,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider allowing vehicles to be fitted with LED rear lamps, similar to the case now for LED head lamps."
2022-02-14-T-075-S-01113,2022-02-14-T-075,1113,S Iswaran,"Today, LTA already allows LED rear lamps which comply with international safety standards to be installed on a vehicle. To ensure safety, these lamps need to be certified and endorsed by the vehicle manufacturer and installed according to the vehicle manufacturer's recommendation. These requirements are the same as those for LED head lamps."
2022-02-14-T-076-S-01114,2022-02-14-T-076,1114,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how does the Ministry ensure that technicians performing maintenance and repair works in Singapore's vehicle workshops are qualified and certified; and (b) how often are enforcement checks on the qualifications carried out.
2022-02-14-T-076-S-01115,2022-02-14-T-076,1115,S Iswaran,"To ensure that vehicles are safe for use on our roads, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires them to be inspected at Authorised Inspection Centres (AICs). This is more efficient than regulating motor vehicle workshops or their technicians, which could entail greater compliance costs for business owners and consumers. Older vehicles, vehicles used for point-to-point passenger transport, as well as goods vehicles are subjected to more frequent inspections. Vehicles that do not pass these inspections cannot be used on the roads."
2022-02-14-T-076-S-01116,2022-02-14-T-076,1116,S Iswaran,"The AICs are, in turn, regulated by LTA. For example, the inspectors have to attain specific certification, such as a certificate from the National Institute of Technical Education in relevant fields, such as automotive technology, to be qualified. It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to hire someone without the requisite qualifications. So far, LTA's inspection regime has helped to ensure that the vehicles used locally are in good condition."
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01117,2022-02-14-T-077,1117,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Transport whether Changi Airport can deepen and widen its strength in cargo and air-freight handling.
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01118,2022-02-14-T-077,1118,S Iswaran,"The Singapore air cargo hub contributes to Singapore's economic success by helping our businesses access global markets and attracting foreign direct investments. We are also a well-connected transhipment hub facilitating global trade flows through Singapore. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing challenges, Changi Airport has remained a pre-eminent cargo hub."
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01119,2022-02-14-T-077,1119,S Iswaran,The Government is working closely with the Changi Airport Group (CAG) and other aviation partners to further strengthen our capabilities in air cargo and freight handling to entrench Changi Airport as an air cargo hub.
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01120,2022-02-14-T-077,1120,S Iswaran,"Changi Airport has maintained its extensive cargo network throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Air freight throughput has recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels, with total airfreight throughput for 2021 at 1.95 million tonnes, compared to 2.01 million tonnes in 2019."
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01121,2022-02-14-T-077,1121,S Iswaran,"To boost capacity, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and CAG had worked closely with airline partners to introduce passenger aircraft for cargo conveyance operations, expand their freighter operations, and introduce new freighter operators. Singapore Airlines (SIA) is also investing in its freighter fleet and has recently announced that seven A350 freighters will be delivered from 2025, with an option for five more. This new-generation aircraft offers better fuel economy, longer range and greater deployment flexibility to better serve cargo customers."
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01122,2022-02-14-T-077,1122,S Iswaran,"Changi Airport has also developed capabilities to handle cargo in high growth areas. For example, with dedicated temperature-controlled facilities, Changi Airport can provide cold chain solutions to maintain the integrity of pharmaceutical cargo and the freshness and quality of perishable products. This has enabled Singapore to play a key role as a vaccine distribution centre for the region. Companies across the air cargo value chain are upgrading themselves to obtain international certification, such as the Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for pharmaceuticals and perishables."
2022-02-14-T-077-S-01123,2022-02-14-T-077,1123,S Iswaran,"The aviation community, with funding support from CAAS, is also investing in proof-of-concept projects that aim to reduce reliance on manpower for cargo operations, such as the use of autonomous vehicles at the airside."
2022-02-14-T-078-S-01124,2022-02-14-T-078,1124,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Transport what is the progress of the travel bubble for Singapore and Bintan.
2022-02-14-T-078-S-01125,2022-02-14-T-078,1125,S Iswaran,"Singapore and Indonesia are working towards an arrangement to facilitate two-way quarantine-free travel for fully-vaccinated travellers between Singapore and Bintan, while managing the associated public health risks. Further updates will be provided when these discussions are completed."
2022-02-14-T-079-S-01126,2022-02-14-T-079,1126,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the benchmarks that will be used to determine when Changi Airport Terminal 2 will resume operations; and (b) what are the plans to ensure that there will be sufficient workers to support the resumption of operations for Terminal 2.
2022-02-14-T-079-S-01127,2022-02-14-T-079,1127,S Iswaran,Operations at Changi Airport Terminal 2 (T2) were suspended on 1 May 2020 to accelerate the T2 expansion works. The Changi Airport Group plans to progressively reopen T2 from 2022 as these works are completed. This will support the recovery in air travel.
2022-02-14-T-079-S-01128,2022-02-14-T-079,1128,S Iswaran,"To prepare for the anticipated increase in travel volume, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is working with the companies in the airport community to ramp up their manpower. They are progressively recalling aviation workers who had been redeployed earlier to other sectors as well as hiring new manpower to replace workers who had left. CAAS is also working with the companies to beef up their business continuity planning to ensure system resilience, given the evolving COVID-19 situation."
2022-02-14-T-080-S-01129,2022-02-14-T-080,1129,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are aviation safety concerns arising from Singapore's push for 5G technologies; and (b) if so, what are the mitigation measures that will be put in place to ensure aviation safety in Singapore's airspace."
2022-02-14-T-080-S-01130,2022-02-14-T-080,1130,S Iswaran,"The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has been working closely with the Infocomm Media Development Authority, local telecommunication companies and international aviation regulators to assess the potential impact of 5G technology on aircraft operations in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-080-S-01131,2022-02-14-T-080,1131,S Iswaran,"Airline pilots operating in Singapore have not reported any interference to aircraft operations. The 5G network in Singapore uses a frequency band of 3.45 to 3.65 GHz, which is far away from that used by aircraft radio altimeters at 4.2 to 4.4 GHz. The 5G base stations in Singapore also have low power emission levels. These factors significantly lower the risk of any potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters. In addition, CAAS has conducted live trials in Singapore and these trials have not flagged any significant interference to aircraft operations. CAAS will continue to monitor this issue closely."
2022-02-14-T-081-S-01132,2022-02-14-T-081,1132,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the implications to Singapore due to the realignment of the Flight Information Region (FIR) boundary between Singapore and Indonesia; and (b) whether this realigned FIR will bring long-term benefits to Singapore's competitiveness and air hub status.
2022-02-14-T-081-S-01133,2022-02-14-T-081,1133,S Iswaran,The implications of the realignment of the Flight Information Region (FIR) boundary between Singapore and Indonesia and whether the realigned FIR will bring long-term benefits to Singapore's competitiveness and air hub status have been addressed by the Minister for Transport in the Ministerial Statement – The Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta and the Singapore Flight Information Regions – at the Parliament Sitting on 14 February 2022.
2022-02-14-T-082-S-01134,2022-02-14-T-082,1134,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of used and unused COVID-19 self-test kits that are made available for distribution in Singapore; (b) if so, what is the data for the period from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to date; and (c) whether the Ministry and the Ministry of Health will consider environmentally sustainable options to mitigate the environmental impact of such self-test kits in Singapore."
2022-02-14-T-082-S-01135,2022-02-14-T-082,1135,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"About 113 million self-test kits have been distributed or sold in Singapore since the start of the pandemic. These include Antigen Rapid Test kits which the Government distributed to households and workplaces, to individuals who received Health Risk Warnings, as well as kits sold in retail outlets and pharmacies."
2022-02-14-T-082-S-01136,2022-02-14-T-082,1136,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"COVID-19 self-test is an important part of our public health strategy to manage the spread of the virus. The Government's priority has been to ensure that self-test kits are adequate, safe and effective. The disposal of used test kits is governed by guidelines that are driven by the need to minimise exposure to and cross contamination from these used kits. We will work with MOH to monitor the development of more environmentally-sustainable self-test kits and consider adopting them when they are available."
2022-02-14-T-083-S-01137,2022-02-14-T-083,1137,Shahira Abdullah,asked  the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider stricter and swifter contingency protocols to disperse crowds during these COVID-19 prevalent times in order to avoid spontaneous potential superspreader events.
2022-02-14-T-083-S-01138,2022-02-14-T-083,1138,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Agencies typically plan ahead and increase deployment of Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) during festive periods or major events. Agencies also step up enforcement checks around specific hotspots. While agencies proactively work with stakeholders to plan the necessary safe management arrangements, it is not possible to prevent crowds from forming spontaneously. When unforeseen crowding takes place and agencies are alerted, SDAs and EOs will respond to the site and act to disperse the crowds. Where circumstances require, the Police will be brought in."
2022-02-14-T-083-S-01139,2022-02-14-T-083,1139,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Everyone must continue to do their part to be socially responsible. Agencies will continue to take firm enforcement action, including prosecution, against individuals and groups who do not comply with safe management measures."
2022-02-14-T-084-S-01140,2022-02-14-T-084,1140,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Education (a) how many places are available in Special Education (SPED) schools for students with autism in (i) schools that serve children with other disabilities and (ii) schools that only serve children with autism; and (b) what is the average waiting time for enrolment in these schools.
2022-02-14-T-084-S-01141,2022-02-14-T-084,1141,Chan Chun Sing,"Nineteen of our 22 SPED schools have programmes to support students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with the exception of Canossian School, Lighthouse School and Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore School. Of these 19 SPED schools, six focus specifically on supporting students with ASD, while others take in students with ASD as well as those who have other Special Educational Needs (SEN). For instance, MINDS – Fernvale Gardens School supports students with intellectual disability but over half of its students also have ASD."
2022-02-14-T-084-S-01142,2022-02-14-T-084,1142,Chan Chun Sing,"There are sufficient places in our SPED schools for children with ASD. Most applicants have a confirmed place within three months of applying. However, the application processing time can extend to six months if more assessment is required. And some families do choose to be waitlisted at their preferred school."
2022-02-14-T-084-S-01143,2022-02-14-T-084,1143,Chan Chun Sing,"To help parents choose a suitable SPED school, MOE organises a Parent Forum together with KK Women's and Children's Hospital and National University Hospital once a year in October/November for parents of K1 students. SPED schools also conduct open houses. Parents are encouraged to indicate their top three choices on the SPED application form."
2022-02-14-T-084-S-01144,2022-02-14-T-084,1144,Chan Chun Sing,"MOE continually monitors the demand for SPED school places and plans ahead with the Social Service Agencies that run the schools to cater to different SEN profiles, including ASD."
2022-02-14-T-085-S-01145,2022-02-14-T-085,1145,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Finance for 2020 and 2021, how much of payments under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) are made to companies that are profitable."
2022-02-14-T-085-S-01146,2022-02-14-T-085,1146,Lawrence Wong,"The objective of JSS was to provide urgently needed cashflow to firms across the board at the most challenging period of the COVID-19 crisis, in particular, during the circuit breaker period. The JSS enabled firms to retain their local employees and to subsequently bounce back from the crisis as local and global demand recovered. Our timely fiscal support, through JSS and other relief schemes, conclusively helped to avert a deeper crisis for Singapore, and, in particular, helped firms survive the crisis."
2022-02-14-T-085-S-01147,2022-02-14-T-085,1147,Lawrence Wong,"This is why we had designed the JSS such that the eligibility for the scheme is not determined by profitability but by whether the firm employs local workers (evidenced by payment of CPF contributions). In that context, we should not focus on the profitability of the JSS recipients, but on the outcomes achieved through this scheme, which is aimed at preserving local employment."
2022-02-14-T-086-S-01148,2022-02-14-T-086,1148,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Finance what was the highest income tax rate for each year from 1991 to 2013.
2022-02-14-T-086-S-01149,2022-02-14-T-086,1149,Lawrence Wong,Mr Leong Mun Wai  had asked a similar question on 6 July 2021. MOF had furnished the information and it remains valid.
2022-02-14-T-086-S-01150,2022-02-14-T-086,1150,Lawrence Wong,"The information on the highest marginal personal income tax rate for tax-resident individuals and corporate income tax rate from 1991 to 2013 is reproduced in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively."
2022-02-14-T-086-S-01151,2022-02-14-T-086,1151,Lawrence Wong,
2022-02-14-T-086-S-01152,2022-02-14-T-086,1152,Lawrence Wong,
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01153,2022-02-14-T-087,1153,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Finance over the last five years, what are annual breakdown amounts of Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) that have been collected from (i) Singapore Citizens buying a second property and (ii) Singapore Citizens buying a third and subsequent residential properties, respectively."
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01154,2022-02-14-T-087,1154,Lawrence Wong,"From 2017 to 2021, the average annual amount of Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) collected from Singapore Citizens (SCs) buying a second residential property was around $244 million. The average annual amount of ABSD collected from SCs buying a third and subsequent residential property was around $106 million. The annual breakdowns are provided in Table 1 below."
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01155,2022-02-14-T-087,1155,Lawrence Wong,
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01156,2022-02-14-T-087,1156,Lawrence Wong,"In working out the above information, IRAS had identified errors in an earlier set of data, which was provided in response to Mr Louis Chua's written Parliamentary Question on the breakdown of Buyer's Stamp Duty (BSD) and ABSD collected from SCs, Permanent Residents (PRs), foreigners and entities (including housing developers), and published on 11 January 2022. [Please refer to ""Data on Residential Property Stamp Duties and Additional Buyer's Stamp Duties Collected in Last 10 Years"", 11 January 2022, Official Report, Vol 95, Issue No 45, Written Answers to Questions section.]"
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01157,2022-02-14-T-087,1157,Lawrence Wong,The figures should instead be as in Table 2 below. IRAS apologises for the mistake.
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01158,2022-02-14-T-087,1158,Lawrence Wong,
2022-02-14-T-087-S-01159,2022-02-14-T-087,1159,Lawrence Wong,"For purchases where the parties are of mixed citizenship status (for example, SC and PR joint purchasers), the transfer is categorised under the profile with the highest ABSD rate (that is, SC-PR joint purchasers are categorised under PR)."
2022-02-14-T-088-S-01160,2022-02-14-T-088,1160,Hany Soh,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for each year over the past three years, what is the number of maintenance enforcement applications filed in the Family Justice Courts; and (b) of these, how many are (i) incapacitated male applicants, (ii) female applicants, (iii) male applicants filed on behalf of minor children, (iv) female applicants filed on behalf of minor children, (v) filed during the course of marriage and (vi) cases that managed to reach an amicable resolution at the mediation stage, respectively."
2022-02-14-T-088-S-01161,2022-02-14-T-088,1161,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Maintenance enforcement applications are filed under section 71 of the Women's Charter. Section 71(1) empowers the Court to order any of the enforcement measures listed if any person fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order. Such a maintenance order may be granted to a wife, incapacitated husband or on behalf of a minor child."
2022-02-14-T-088-S-01162,2022-02-14-T-088,1162,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The number of maintenance enforcement applications filed for the last three years is shown in Table 1 below.
2022-02-14-T-088-S-01163,2022-02-14-T-088,1163,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,
2022-02-14-T-088-S-01164,2022-02-14-T-088,1164,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The statistics on the number of maintenance enforcement applications filed during the course of marriage and the number of cases that managed to reach an amicable resolution at the mediation stage are not available, so the Ministry is unable to provide such a breakdown for the past three years."
2022-02-14-T-089-S-01165,2022-02-14-T-089,1165,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in the past two years (a) how many Social Service Agencies (SSA) received more funding from the Ministry to cope with the additional work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic; and (b) what were the mean and median amounts of additional funding provided to each SSA per year.
2022-02-14-T-089-S-01166,2022-02-14-T-089,1166,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past two years, all employers, including Social Service Agencies (SSAs), received support from the Jobs Support Scheme to help keep their businesses running and retain their employees."
2022-02-14-T-089-S-01167,2022-02-14-T-089,1167,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, as the majority of MSF-funded programmes receive funding calibrated by caseload, additional work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic would have resulted in a commensurate increase in funding. However, even when caseloads were reduced (for example, where a programme could serve fewer clients due to safe management measures), MSF maintained funding at pre-COVID-19 levels. Beyond this, MSF provided additional funding to all programmes during FY2020 and FY2021 in the form of support for ancillary costs during COVID-19. For example, overall MSF funding to the Family Service Centres (FSCs) increased from $85.2 million to $90 million, or 5.6%, from FY2019 to FY2020, although actual changes in funding for each FSC would have varied, depending on their caseload and client profile."
2022-02-14-T-089-S-01168,2022-02-14-T-089,1168,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF also reviewed the adequacy of funding against the challenges brought about by the new normal, and adjusted funding models where necessary. For instance, funding to the residential homes rose by an estimated $2.4 million, or 2.9%, from FY2020 to FY2021, in view of additional costs to comply with Safe Management Measures and changes to the Environmental Public Health Act."
2022-02-14-T-089-S-01169,2022-02-14-T-089,1169,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SSAs also benefited from other broad-based support provided to the sector. In February 2020, the ComChest Emergency Fund made available $3,000 to each NCSS member to strengthen business continuity measures, purchase personal protective equipment and carry out cleaning and disinfection of premises. In April 2020, NCSS launched The Invictus Fund (TIF) and has since raised $10 million from the community to support SSAs providing critical services to vulnerable groups. The Government further contributed an additional $18.9 million to TIF, with a focus on helping SSAs invest in technology and transform their service delivery for the new normal. SSAs could also apply to TIF if they needed additional financial support to maintain service continuity and comply with safe management measures."
2022-02-14-T-089-S-01170,2022-02-14-T-089,1170,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MSF will continue to closely monitor and review its funding for programmes to ensure that they receive adequate funding as the COVID-19 situation evolves.
2022-02-14-T-090-S-01171,2022-02-14-T-090,1171,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how the Ministry is working with the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and food charities to prevent duplication of food distribution to reduce manpower wastage and to ensure consistency in distribution quantities.
2022-02-14-T-090-S-01172,2022-02-14-T-090,1172,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The charity food landscape is variegated. Besides food charities providing food support, there are also numerous ground-up initiatives by volunteer groups, grassroots organisations and corporates. Many initiatives, while well-intended, are uncoordinated and some are ad hoc rather than regular activities. Food wastage on the ground can occur when households receive duplicative food support, or food support that is unsuitable for their needs. For example, beneficiaries who are diabetic may receive white rice and bread which they are unable to consume."
2022-02-14-T-090-S-01173,2022-02-14-T-090,1173,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It was in this context that MSF convened the Charity Food Workgroup (CFWG) in 2019 to enable a more coordinated and data-driven approach to charity food support that would reduce duplication and wastage. The Workgroup comprises food support organisations (namely, The Food Bank, Food from the Heart, Free Food for All, Willing Hearts, Mummy Yummy, Singapore Buddhist Welfare Services), volunteers, corporates and Government agencies (MSF, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Health Promotion Board, Government Technology Agency, National Environment Agency and Singapore Food Agency)."
2022-02-14-T-090-S-01174,2022-02-14-T-090,1174,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A simple way to reduce food waste is to enable beneficiaries to choose the type and amount of food support they need. Our CFWG partners have rolled out innovative initiatives such as community shops, meal redemptions, vending machines and community fridges. These efforts not only preserve beneficiaries' dignity of choice, but also make food distribution more efficient and less wasteful."
2022-02-14-T-090-S-01175,2022-02-14-T-090,1175,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are also building capabilities to improve local level coordination and prevent duplication of food support. Local food coordinators (LFCs) have been appointed in three areas – Jalan Kukoh, Kampong Glam and Kembangan-Chai Chee – to coordinate and deconflict local charity food support efforts, particularly festive or corporate giving efforts. MSF is coordinating the development of a food directory and database. This will further support our LFCs and food support organisations, as they will be able to check on duplications and coordinate with other food support organisations to best support the households in need. The food directory will enable members of the public or social service agencies to search for food support based on location or dietary requirements. These would enable better matching, better coordination and reduced duplication."
2022-02-14-T-090-S-01176,2022-02-14-T-090,1176,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Members of the CFWG are also working with Member of Parliament Louis Ng towards the introduction of a Private Member's Bill to encourage food donations and reduce food wastage, while ensuring food safety."
2022-02-14-T-091-S-01177,2022-02-14-T-091,1177,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Health what are the steps taken by the Ministry to raise public awareness to get swift medical intervention and help within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms in order to prevent lifelong disability.
2022-02-14-T-091-S-01178,2022-02-14-T-091,1178,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing a stroke and bleeding risk calculator similar to that provided by the American College of Cardiology so that the public can be encouraged to assess their level of stroke risk and actively take steps to reduce such risk.
2022-02-14-T-091-S-01179,2022-02-14-T-091,1179,Ong Ye Kung,"Stroke is a time-sensitive condition and, for ischaemic stroke, the sooner blood flow is restored to the affected part of the brain, the better the clinical outcomes."
2022-02-14-T-091-S-01180,2022-02-14-T-091,1180,Ong Ye Kung,"Since 2016, MOH has been putting in place various measures to improve public awareness about stroke and to reduce the time taken for a suspected stroke patient to reach the hospital for assessment and treatment. Annual stroke awareness campaigns are conducted to raise public awareness on the early identification of acute stroke symptoms and response actions. Paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) are also trained in pre-hospital stroke protocols to enable swift identification and conveyance of suspected stroke cases to the appropriate hospital for treatment. Public hospitals monitor the access time to stroke treatment as well as the clinical outcomes of stroke patients closely."
2022-02-14-T-091-S-01181,2022-02-14-T-091,1181,Ong Ye Kung,"The Stroke and Bleeding Risk calculator is a tool developed by the American College of Cardiology under their patient engagement programme CardioSmart, to estimate the risk for stroke and bleeding only for patients with atrial fibrillation and not for the general public. There are other risk calculators developed by clinical experts to assess stroke risk in patients with cardiovascular disease by considering risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, smoking and drinking history. MOH will study these risk calculators with inputs from local stroke care experts and, where appropriate, will incorporate these as part of the overall stroke risk prevention framework. Persons at risk of stroke should adopt risk reduction steps, such as regular health screening, maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly, maintaining healthy weight and diet, and avoiding smoking and excessive drinking."
2022-02-14-T-092-S-01182,2022-02-14-T-092,1182,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider increasing the current annual withdrawal limit for outpatient Flexi-MediSave in view of rising outpatient healthcare costs.
2022-02-14-T-092-S-01183,2022-02-14-T-092,1183,Ong Ye Kung,The Ministry had recently increased the Flexi-MediSave limit from $200 to $300 on 1 June 2021 to better support elderly patients in seeking outpatient treatment. Around eight in 10 patients who tapped on Flexi-MediSave did not reach the $300 annual limit in 2021. We will continue to regularly review our MediSave withdrawal limits to strike a balance between improving affordability for ongoing treatment and ensuring sufficient savings for future healthcare needs.
2022-02-14-T-092-S-01184,2022-02-14-T-092,1184,Ong Ye Kung,Patients who cannot afford their treatments after subsidies and MediSave can approach the medical social workers in public healthcare institutions for MediFund and other assistance.
2022-02-14-T-093-S-01185,2022-02-14-T-093,1185,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider including atrial fibrillation as a chronic condition under the Chronic Disease Management Programme for MediSave to be utilised for drugs such as apixaban, for treating this condition."
2022-02-14-T-093-S-01186,2022-02-14-T-093,1186,Ong Ye Kung,"Patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation arising from a condition under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), such as hypertension, can use MediSave for their treatment, including medications such as apixaban. However, atrial fibrillation, as a stand-alone condition, is currently not under CDMP."
2022-02-14-T-093-S-01187,2022-02-14-T-093,1187,Ong Ye Kung,"CDMP conditions are regularly reviewed in consultation with the CDMP Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) and based on considerations, such as disease burden, effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications and availability of clear clinical treatment guidelines. We will take atrial fibrillation into account in our next review."
2022-02-14-T-094-S-01188,2022-02-14-T-094,1188,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Health whether there will be a review of the five-person dining-in limit to allow families with three or more children to dine with grandparents for meals at restaurants.
2022-02-14-T-094-S-01189,2022-02-14-T-094,1189,Ong Ye Kung,This question has been addressed in my reply to Question No 80 for Oral Answer on the Order Paper for 14 February 2022.
2022-02-14-T-095-S-01190,2022-02-14-T-095,1190,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) as of January 2022, what proportion of Omicron cases comprises the B2.A sub-variant; and (b) what is the Ministry's assessment of the threat from the B2.A sub-variant versus the B1.A sub-variant."
2022-02-14-T-095-S-01191,2022-02-14-T-095,1191,Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, about 15% of local Omicron cases sequenced were of the BA.2 sub-lineage."
2022-02-14-T-095-S-01192,2022-02-14-T-095,1192,Ong Ye Kung,"Preliminary studies overseas have found BA.2 to be more transmissible than BA.1. However, there is currently no indication that BA.2 causes more severe illness, compared to BA.1, or that vaccines will not work as well against the subvariant."
2022-02-14-T-095-S-01193,2022-02-14-T-095,1193,Ong Ye Kung,MOH will continue to monitor circulating COVID-19 strains as well as international and local data on the BA.2 sub-lineage.
2022-02-14-T-096-S-01194,2022-02-14-T-096,1194,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) to date, how many persons born before 1980 have voluntarily enrolled into the CareShield Life scheme; and (b) what is the premium payable by such persons to join the Scheme, segmented by gender and age groups."
2022-02-14-T-096-S-01195,2022-02-14-T-096,1195,Ong Ye Kung,"As at end January 2022, around 537,000 ElderShield 400 policyholders born in 1970 to 1979 have been automatically enrolled into CareShield Life. In addition, we have approved about 60,000 applications from persons born before 1980 to join CareShield Life. All auto-enrollees and approved applicants will have their CareShield Life covers fully activated after their first premium payment, starting from March 2022. However, in the event an individual becomes severely disabled before that, he or she will be allowed to claim."
2022-02-14-T-096-S-01196,2022-02-14-T-096,1196,Ong Ye Kung,"CareShield Life premiums vary widely across individuals depending on multiple factors, such as age, gender, whether they have an existing ElderShield policy and year of joining CareShield Life. For those who are upgrading from ElderShield 400 to CareShield Life in 2022, the annual premiums for 50-year-old males and females are about $470 and $600, while that for 65-year-old males and females are about $630 and $830. Premiums would be higher for those without an existing ElderShield policy or with ElderShield 300 policy, while premiums could be lower for those who are eligible for means-tested premium subsidies and participation incentives."
2022-02-14-T-096-S-01197,2022-02-14-T-096,1197,Ong Ye Kung,"To encourage those who are born before 1980 to apply for CareShield Life, the Government has been raising awareness of the scheme through the media and targeted outreach efforts in collaboration with the People's Association, the Silver Generation Office, Social Service Offices, unions and insurers. In addition, the Government provides participation incentives of up to $4,000 for those born before 1980 who join CareShield Life by 31 December 2023. These participation incentives would be used to offset the premiums over 10 years."
2022-02-14-T-097-S-01198,2022-02-14-T-097,1198,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Health what is the projected annual healthcare spending for the next decade.
2022-02-14-T-097-S-01199,2022-02-14-T-097,1199,Ong Ye Kung,"As stated in my address at MOH's work plan seminar on 25 May 2021, Singapore's National Health Expenditure could increase from $22 billion in 2018 to $59 billion in 2030 as our population ages."
2022-02-14-T-098-S-01200,2022-02-14-T-098,1200,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health with the recent surge in cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant and the resignation rates of healthcare workers going up last year, whether the Ministry will consider drawing healthcare resources from across the Public Service, including MINDEF and SCDF, to alleviate the healthcare manpower crunch."
2022-02-14-T-098-S-01201,2022-02-14-T-098,1201,Ong Ye Kung,"MOH has tapped on the SAF and Public Service, as well as private sector resources, in the national effort against the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, during the surge in COVID-19 cases at the end of last year, public healthcare workers from Woodlands Health, medical officers and medics from the SAF medical corps, and nurses and dental therapists from the Health Promotion Board (HPB) jointly ran a COVID-19 Treatment Facility (CTF). Private healthcare workers have also helped us on our vaccination drive, and management of cases at GPs and in the CTFs."
2022-02-14-T-098-S-01202,2022-02-14-T-098,1202,Ong Ye Kung,We thank all our partnering organisations for working closely with us.
2022-02-14-T-098-S-01203,2022-02-14-T-098,1203,Ong Ye Kung,Our healthcare officers have been under immense stress for the past two years. These contributions and staff expertise have been an invaluable help.
2022-02-14-T-099-S-01204,2022-02-14-T-099,1204,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the safeguards or checks to ensure that junior doctors are not pressured to under-report working hours; and (b) whether the Ministry studies or has estimates on the rate of under-reporting of working hours.
2022-02-14-T-099-S-01205,2022-02-14-T-099,1205,Ong Ye Kung,"Healthcare institutions (HCIs) use various methods, including electronic logging and surveys, to monitor the work hours and well-being of junior doctors. MOH Holdings also regularly checks proxy indicators, for example, late night transport claims which may indicate junior doctors working beyond logged hours."
2022-02-14-T-099-S-01206,2022-02-14-T-099,1206,Ong Ye Kung,"In addition, we have a whistle-blowing channel for all junior doctors to anonymously report incidences of wrongful workplace practices. MOH Holdings takes such feedback seriously and will investigate the reported incidents."
2022-02-14-T-099-S-01207,2022-02-14-T-099,1207,Ong Ye Kung,"Based on all the data and feedback collected, we have not detected any systemic under-reporting of working hours."
2022-02-14-T-100-S-01208,2022-02-14-T-100,1208,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, how many migrant workers in Singapore have been enrolled into COVID-19 clinical trials; and (b) what measures are implemented to ensure that appropriate informed consent took place without duress."
2022-02-14-T-100-S-01209,2022-02-14-T-100,1209,Ong Ye Kung,"A clinical trial is a research study of a health product to discover or verify its effects and ascertain its safety or efficacy in trial participants. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has approved one COVID-19 clinical trial on migrant workers. The trial recruited 4,257 migrant workers to assess whether existing treatments could reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
2022-02-14-T-100-S-01210,2022-02-14-T-100,1210,Ong Ye Kung,"Institutions who wish to conduct clinical trials are required to obtain regulatory approval from HSA under the Health Product (Clinical Trials) Regulations based on prevailing requirements. The principal investigator (PI) for the study is also required to seek ethical approval from the relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) and ensure that written informed consent is obtained from trial participants in accordance with the requirements under the Health Products (Clinical Trials) Regulations. It is an offence under the Regulations for any person to cause, compel or induce another person to give consent or to participate in a clinical trial by coercion, intimidation, deception or misrepresentation."
2022-02-14-T-100-S-01211,2022-02-14-T-100,1211,Ong Ye Kung,"As necessary, PIs should document informed consent by means of a written, signed and dated informed consent form. During consent-taking, PIs should also ensure that participants understand the contents of the form, provide ample opportunities for clarification, and inform participants that they may choose to withdraw from the trial at any time without penalty."
2022-02-14-T-101-S-01212,2022-02-14-T-101,1212,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Singaporeans have ongoing follow-up with a restructured hospital or national specialty centre outpatient clinic; and (b) what is the number broken down by travelling time by public transport from place of residence, including travelling times of (i) less than 30 minutes, (ii) 31 to 60 minutes, (iii) 61 to 90 minutes and (iv) more than 90 minutes."
2022-02-14-T-101-S-01213,2022-02-14-T-101,1213,Ong Ye Kung,"In 2020, about 1.05 million Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs) had ongoing follow-up Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC) appointments at the public hospitals or national specialty centres."
2022-02-14-T-101-S-01214,2022-02-14-T-101,1214,Ong Ye Kung,More than 90% of the patients have a travel time of less than an hour. The estimated travelling time of these patients by public transport from their place of residence to the public hospitals or national specialty centres is shown in the table below.
2022-02-14-T-101-S-01215,2022-02-14-T-101,1215,Ong Ye Kung,
2022-02-14-T-102-S-01216,2022-02-14-T-102,1216,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in each of the last five years, how many persons with caring responsibilities approached the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) for help; (b) how many of these carers required assistance for (i) between three and six months (ii) six and 12 months and (iii) more than a year; and (c) what is the breakdown of the types of help provided by AIC to these individuals."
2022-02-14-T-102-S-01217,2022-02-14-T-102,1217,Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past five years, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) received an average of 100,000 enquiries per year through their physical and virtual touchpoints. As multiple enquiries could be submitted through different channels, this figure is not reflective of the number of unique individuals. AIC does not track whether enquires were made by caregivers, seniors, or healthcare professionals, nor the duration of assistance provided."
2022-02-14-T-102-S-01218,2022-02-14-T-102,1218,Ong Ye Kung,"AIC supports caregivers through a variety of means. AIC places seniors with various eldercare services, such as day and home care, palliative and nursing home care, and respite care services, to meet their short-, medium- and long-term care needs. Over the last five years, AIC referred about 34,000 seniors per year to eldercare services."
2022-02-14-T-102-S-01219,2022-02-14-T-102,1219,Ong Ye Kung,"AIC also administers support schemes, such as the Caregivers' Training Grant (CTG), the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG), and the expanded Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF), to enable caregivers to receive training and financial support. In 2021 alone, around 34,400 and 19,500 beneficiaries received the HCG and SMF, respectively."
2022-02-14-T-103-S-01220,2022-02-14-T-103,1220,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health (a) over the past five years, what is the annual prevalence of obesity for children aged below 18 years, with a breakdown by their (i) housing type and (ii) race; (b) how has the childhood obesity rate been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; and (c) what is the assessed effectiveness of measures to prevent and address childhood obesity."
2022-02-14-T-103-S-01221,2022-02-14-T-103,1221,Ong Ye Kung,"From 2017 to 2021, the proportion of students who were overweight (BMI-for-age at or above the 90th percentile"
2022-02-14-T-103-S-01222,2022-02-14-T-103,1222,Ong Ye Kung,"We have undertaken various measures to prevent and address childhood obesity. We work with MOE, Early Childhood Development Agency and preschools to provide school health promotion for students, parents and staff. In schools and Institutes of Higher Learning, we provide healthier meals. HPB also supplements school-based efforts with community-based healthy eating and physical activity programmes. Secondary schools and the Institute of Technical Education also offer lifestyle coaching to severely overweight students. In 2021, 64% of the participants achieved BMI reduction of more than 0.5 points or reached their acceptable weight by the end of the six-month programme."
2022-02-14-T-104-S-01223,2022-02-14-T-104,1223,Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Health what are the anticipated respective budgets required for each of the next five years to accommodate the expansion of the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund and the Assistive Technology Fund as announced in January 2022.
2022-02-14-T-104-S-01224,2022-02-14-T-104,1224,Ong Ye Kung,"The estimated average additional annual budget required for the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) expansion is $49 million over the next five years, compared to the average annual utilisation of around $27 million over the previous five years. For the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF), the estimated annual budget over the next five years is $7 million, compared to the average annual utilisation of $4 million in the previous five years."
2022-02-14-T-105-S-01225,2022-02-14-T-105,1225,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Government has plans to support SPH Media Trust in its digital transformation; and (b) if so, in what specific areas."
2022-02-14-T-105-S-01226,2022-02-14-T-105,1226,Josephine Teo,"As MCI stated in Parliament on 10 May 2021, the Government is committed to support SPH Media Trust in its digital transformation, in areas like digital innovation and capability development."
2022-02-14-T-105-S-01227,2022-02-14-T-105,1227,Josephine Teo,MCI will provide a more detailed update to Parliament shortly.
2022-02-14-T-106-S-01228,2022-02-14-T-106,1228,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for National Development which public agencies and legislation govern the use of CCTVs installed on private residential properties, particularly to ensure that the privacy of neighbouring land occupants is safeguarded."
2022-02-14-T-106-S-01229,2022-02-14-T-106,1229,Desmond Lee,"No legislation or public agency explicitly and specifically targets the use of CCTV cameras installed on private residential properties. But other laws may apply, depending on the circumstances."
2022-02-14-T-106-S-01230,2022-02-14-T-106,1230,Desmond Lee,"For instance, private property residents may look to the Community Disputes Resolution Act (CDRA), which sets out the standards of conduct between neighbours. Under CDRA, a resident must not unreasonably interfere with his neighbour's enjoyment or use of the neighbour's place of residence. This includes interference through the surveillance of the neighbour or the neighbour's place of residence, where the surveillance is done at or in the vicinity of that place of residence. If both sides are unable to resolve the matter through direct discussions, his neighbour may attempt community mediation or, as a last resort, file a claim before the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals."
2022-02-14-T-107-S-01231,2022-02-14-T-107,1231,Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of divorcees who do not qualify for HDB rental flats because of their income and yet also unable to afford any HDB flat in the open market; and (b) if so, what is the current number."
2022-02-14-T-107-S-01232,2022-02-14-T-107,1232,Desmond Lee,"Public rental flats are intended to provide highly-subsidised rental housing to low-income and vulnerable citizen households who have no other housing options. HDB carefully assesses every request for a rental flat to understand each household's budget and circumstances, such as whether they can afford to buy a flat, rent from the open market, or stay with their family."
2022-02-14-T-107-S-01233,2022-02-14-T-107,1233,Desmond Lee,"HDB does not reject requests based on income alone and will assist households with a rental flat if they have no other housing options. Hence, we do not track the number of divorcees whose requests for public rental were rejected because of their income, and are unable to provide the number of those who cannot afford an HDB flat on the open market."
2022-02-14-T-108-S-01234,2022-02-14-T-108,1234,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the take-up rate of volunteer leave by public service employees; (b) whether the Ministry has any data on the number of private sector companies that offer volunteer leave to their staff and the take-up rate for such companies; and (c) if so, what are they respectively."
2022-02-14-T-108-S-01235,2022-02-14-T-108,1235,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As part of the national SG Cares movement, MCCY has been working closely with the Public Service Division (PSD) to champion staff volunteerism in all public sector agencies. Civil servants can utilise one day of volunteer leave to volunteer in any local charity with an Institution of Public Character status. This is an additional provision over and above their vacation leave. The yearly average take-up for volunteer leave by civil servants prior to COVID-19 was in the hundreds, although this figure has decreased during the COVID-19 period. However, the extent of volunteerism among officers goes beyond this as officers have been volunteering through activities organised by their agencies under the Public Service Cares initiative (PS Cares)."
2022-02-14-T-108-S-01236,2022-02-14-T-108,1236,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"PS Cares provides officers the platform to engage and serve the community without the need for them to take leave. For example, in 2020 and 2021, about 4,350 officers volunteered in COVID-19 operation roles, including going door-to-door to help seniors register for vaccinations and supporting the mobile vaccination teams."
2022-02-14-T-108-S-01237,2022-02-14-T-108,1237,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) promotes volunteerism in the corporate sector. As part of the Company of Good (COG) programme developed by NVPC, COG members are encouraged to put in place policies, such as paid volunteer leave, to promote corporate giving."
2022-02-14-T-108-S-01238,2022-02-14-T-108,1238,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"From the Corporate Giving Study 2021 conducted by NVPC, approximately 29% of the 1,014 companies surveyed had paid volunteer leave provisions for staff 1. For companies reported to have paid volunteer leave provisions, an average of 42% of the company's employees utilised volunteer leave. NVPC will be releasing the findings from the study in March 2022."
2022-02-14-T-109-S-01239,2022-02-14-T-109,1239,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there has been an increase in the percentage of self-employed persons in the resident workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (b) if so, what policies have been or will be put in place to better protect their job security."
2022-02-14-T-109-S-01240,2022-02-14-T-109,1240,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can provide an update on plans to provide greater structural support and CPF contributions for workers who are self-employed, especially those who operate in the gig economy."
2022-02-14-T-109-S-01241,2022-02-14-T-109,1241,Tan See Leng,The proportion of Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) in our resident workforce has remained stable at between 8% and 10% over the past five years.
2022-02-14-T-109-S-01242,2022-02-14-T-109,1242,Tan See Leng,"Over the years, the Government has put in place several measures to support SEPs. They are required to make CPF contributions to their MediSave account and we have piloted the Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE) scheme to make it more convenient for them to do so. Eligible lower-income SEPs will receive up to $2,667 of Workfare payouts per year. The Government has also worked with insurers to introduce prolonged medical leave insurance, which many SEP drivers and riders are now covered by. Like other Singaporeans, they are also covered by national healthcare schemes. The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) provides mediation services to SEPs to address disputes with their service buyers and SEPs can have their rights enforced at the Small Claims Tribunal. Additionally, those who wish to transit to regular employment can tap on our skills training and employment facilitation services, including career advisory counselling offered by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Employment and Employability Institute (e2i)."
2022-02-14-T-109-S-01243,2022-02-14-T-109,1243,Tan See Leng,"To strengthen protections for platform workers and ensure a more balanced relationship between platform companies and their workers, MOM convened an Advisory Committee last year. Since then, the Committee has received extensive feedback from various stakeholders, including over 1,300 responses to the public consultation paper published in November 2021. The Committee is continuing to engage stakeholders further on these matters."
2022-02-14-T-110-S-01244,2022-02-14-T-110,1244,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Manpower when is Singapore forecasted to start seeing a negative local workforce growth and whether there is a likelihood of it stagnating.
2022-02-14-T-110-S-01245,2022-02-14-T-110,1245,Tan See Leng,"Resident workforce growth has been slowing due to lower birth rates and an ageing population. From 2011 to 2015, the resident workforce grew by 55,200 per annum on average. From 2016 to 2020, resident workforce growth averaged 20,600 per annum. In the March 2017 Parliamentary Sitting, we said that we expect resident workforce growth to head for stagnation over the subsequent 10 years. However, we now expect our resident workforce to continue growing beyond 2027. This is, in part, due to rising resident employment rates in the 65 and over age group as well as for women, reflecting our efforts to raise the employability of senior workers and women. The point at which our resident workforce will stagnate will depend on a host of factors, including our continued efforts mentioned above."
2022-02-14-T-110-S-01246,2022-02-14-T-110,1246,Tan See Leng,"To better support senior workers who are able and wish to continue working for longer, we have been implementing the recommendations made by the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers in 2019. These include raising the retirement and re-employment ages, increasing the CPF contribution rates of senior workers, and working with tripartite partners to facilitate companies in conducting structured career planning and to offer more flexible employment options."
2022-02-14-T-110-S-01247,2022-02-14-T-110,1247,Tan See Leng,We will continue to work with tripartite partners to promote and support flexible work arrangements to support workers in managing both their work and personal commitments. This will help employers to better attract and retain workers.
2022-02-14-T-110-S-01248,2022-02-14-T-110,1248,Tan See Leng,"Notwithstanding these efforts, we will have to continue to raise productivity as our resident workforce growth slows. This is why we have been focusing on technology and innovation-driven growth in our economic transformation."
2022-02-14-T-111-S-01249,2022-02-14-T-111,1249,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower for 2021, what are the respective percentages of migrant workers living in dormitories who were infected with COVID-19 and who (i) had no or mild symptoms, (ii) required oxygen in the general ward, (iii) were in ICU and (iv) died, broken down by those vaccinated and unvaccinated."
2022-02-14-T-111-S-01250,2022-02-14-T-111,1250,Tan See Leng,About 98% of migrant workers living in dormitories are fully vaccinated. The vast majority of migrant workers living in dormitories that were infected with COVID-19 in 2021 were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.
2022-02-14-T-111-S-01251,2022-02-14-T-111,1251,Tan See Leng,"In 2021, 11 fully vaccinated migrant workers required oxygen or were admitted to intensive care. This represents 0.05% of vaccinated migrant workers who tested positive on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Another seven unvaccinated or partially vaccinated migrant workers needed oxygen supplementation or were admitted to intensive care, representing 0.32% of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated migrant workers who tested PCR-positive. This proportion is more than six times that of vaccinated migrant workers. There were no COVID-19-related deaths amongst migrant workers living in dormitories in 2021."
