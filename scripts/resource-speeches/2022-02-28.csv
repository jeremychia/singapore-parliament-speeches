2022-02-28-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Transport with the recent surge in COVID-19 infections among bus drivers reported on 15 February 2022 (a) what has been the impact on public bus transport; (b) whether this has resulted in longer waiting times for commuters; and (c) what are the mitigating measures to ensure public bus transport availability.,1,1,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00001
2022-02-28-T-001,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Omicron variant is more infectious, we have seen an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the community. Due to high vaccination and booster rates, as well as tight safe management measures, infected bus captains, or BCs, account for less than 5% of the total BC population.",1,2,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00002
2022-02-28-T-001,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Transport),"LTA and the bus operators are watching the situation closely. If we face a large increase in the number of infected BCs, the contingency plans will be activated to ensure that essential bus services continue to operate. That is the key. And this includes lengthening of bus service headways, starting with low demand bus services. Some of these plans have already been implemented, with about 90 bus services experiencing increased waiting times of not more than three minutes. Where possible, LTA and the bus operators will also deploy more double-deck buses for services with higher loading.",2,3,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00003
2022-02-28-T-001,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Transport),"Sir, I would like to thank our commuters for their continued understanding and support for the hard work and sacrifices of our public transport workers, as we ride this wave together.",3,4,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00004
2022-02-28-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Pereira.,1,5,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00005
2022-02-28-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Speaker and I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have a supplementary question. May I know if bus companies have a group of reserved drivers or maybe even recently retired drivers that they can turn to in times of need? If not, this would be something LTA might want to consider, moving forth.",1,6,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00006
2022-02-28-T-001,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Ms Pereira for her feedback, her suggestion. I think that is a good point. We do have a group of recently retired and also former BCs. We have been reaching out. As Ms Pereira is aware, we are trying to increase the number of local BCs by reaching out to more individuals to join us, to take on this important and meaningful role, to be part of the public transport workforce.",1,7,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00007
2022-02-28-T-001,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"At the same time, we know that it is not easy to train a BC, because it takes time. So, while we try to bring back the former BCs, retired BCs, we also need time to train new ones. This is an ongoing effort. We want to do both  we want to bring in new BCs to join us, to grow our workforce for public transport workers; and at the same time, if we can bring back some of the former BCs as well as those who are recently retired, that will also help.",2,8,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00008
2022-02-28-T-001,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"If I may also make a call to commuters that during this period, what is very important is to keep everybody safe on our public transport system. So, please cooperate with the safe management measures, including wearing your masks on MRTs, on trains, minimise talking. These are all simple but effective steps to keep everybody safe.",3,9,2022-02-28-T-001-S-00009
2022-02-28-T-002,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Health regarding the approximately 21,800 people aged 18 and above whose COVID-19 vaccination status had lapsed on 14 February 2022 (a) what is the general profile of these individuals; (b) whether the Ministry has information on why these people do not take their booster jabs; and (c) whether there are plans to reach out to these individuals to assist them to receive the booster jab.",1,10,2022-02-28-T-002-S-00010
2022-02-28-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, amongst the 21,800 individuals aged 18 and above, whose vaccination status had lapsed on 14 February 2022, 38% are work pass holders, 14% are Permanent Residents and the remaining are Singaporeans. MOH is unable to ascertain the reasons for them not getting their boosters, but indications are that many of them are overseas.",1,11,2022-02-28-T-002-S-00011
2022-02-28-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As for the Singaporeans who are not boosted, the majority are seniors aged 60 years and above. A common reason for not getting booster jabs is that they seldom go out, they feel adequately protected with their primary vaccination and they prefer to delay their booster vaccination.",2,12,2022-02-28-T-002-S-00012
2022-02-28-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"MOH will continue to encourage individuals to come forward and take their booster shots when they are eligible, using SMS reminders, making vaccination as convenient as possible and, also importantly, deploying Mobile Vaccination Teams to the heartlands to reach out especially to seniors.",3,13,2022-02-28-T-002-S-00013
2022-02-28-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what measures are being taken to reduce the negative impact on sensitive intertidal habitats like Changi Beach in view of increased visitorship; and (b) what is the Government's position on managing public access to sensitive intertidal habitats.,1,14,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00014
2022-02-28-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether visitation numbers to Changi Beach have increased in the past two years and, if so, by how much; (b) what is the impact of such an increase on marine life in the intertidal zone; (c) what are the measures implemented by NParks to curb the increase in human traffic and destructive human activity to marine wildlife; and (d) whether there are plans to extend the Parks and Trees Act to the intertidal areas of beaches in Singapore to deter destruction of marine life.",1,15,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00015
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Leon Perera have asked about the management of marine wildlife at intertidal areas, such as Changi Beach. Mr Leon Perera",1,16,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00016
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Over the last two years, we have observed a general increase in the number of visitors to our beaches, including Changi Beach. There has also been an increase in visitors to the intertidal zone, especially during low tides. Most of the visitors are families that come in small groups to explore the area, during public or school holidays.",2,17,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00017
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We are committed to protecting the biodiversity of our coastal and marine ecosystems, including our intertidal zones. To assess the health of these ecosystems, NParks conducts long-term habitat monitoring in collaboration with academics and volunteers. Recent data indicates that our marine biodiversity is generally in good condition, with little change in the composition of the marine ecosystem within key habitats since 2016.",3,18,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00018
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Our native wildlife species, including threatened marine species such as sea turtles and stony corals, are also protected under the Wildlife Act. For example, individuals who are found guilty of trapping or selling protected wildlife species without approval may be subject to a fine of up to $50,000, or to an imprisonment term of up to two years, or both. Over the past five years, there have been no cases prosecuted for the poaching of marine wildlife under the Wildlife Act or its predecessor, the Wild Animals and Birds Act. We will continue to review our measures to safeguard our marine species and will take enforcement action where necessary.",4,19,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00019
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Since 2021, with the increase in visitorship to these areas, we have also stepped up outreach efforts at various intertidal areas to raise public awareness on protecting marine wildlife. For example, NParks has deployed more officers and galvanised many volunteers to remind visitors to refrain from touching, trampling and collecting marine wildlife. Most visitors are cooperative and return the marine wildlife when advised to do so. In addition, we have put up more signs around the intertidal areas, to educate visitors on how to interact responsibly with marine wildlife. NParks will continue to step up these efforts.",5,20,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00020
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We are discussing with our partners, such as the marine conservation community, volunteers, businesses and the local community, on ways to manage the number of visitors at intertidal areas, in a way that supports nature conservation while keeping these spaces open for public recreation. For example, last weekend, we held a workshop with various partners to discuss how we can work together to educate visitors on Singapore's rich marine biodiversity and to better manage our intertidal sites. We are also assessing the possibility of strengthening protection for marine organisms under the Wildlife Act.",6,21,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00021
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"As we transform into a City in Nature, all of us have a part to play in protecting and caring for our rich biodiversity, so that our future generations can continue to enjoy our natural heritage.",7,22,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00022
2022-02-28-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.,1,23,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00023
2022-02-28-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his response. I have a few supplementary questions. Will the Ministry consider publicising where are these areas so that public are aware that these are eco-sensitive areas? And two, will the Ministry consider working with schools to better educate children on such eco-sensitive areas?",1,24,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00024
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Yes, we will consider both measures. On the former, publicising these areas, the media have been giving coverage to the sites that have been impacted. The low tide days and times are also well-known, publicly available information, and hence, you see the crowd converging on these sites when we reach those seasons.",1,25,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00025
2022-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For schools, we continue to work with our schools through our programmes to work with young people to better understand how to relate to wildlife, including in our marine habitats.",2,26,2022-02-28-T-003-S-00026
2022-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the proposed legislation on workplace discrimination which the Government is considering (a) whether the Government will consider including a prohibition against attendance bonus, which is a disincentive for employees taking medical leave when they are sick; and (b) if not, why not.",1,27,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00027
2022-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, I refer the Member to MOM's earlier reply to Dr Shahira Abdullah and Mr Leon Perera on 14 February, where we explained that the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) already require employers to appraise and remunerate employees in a fair and objective manner, taking into consideration the employees' performance and contributions. Attendance-related incentive schemes that consider sick leave utilisation are contrary to this principle. Companies should therefore review and make adjustments where necessary.",1,28,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00028
2022-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Manpower),"From next year onwards, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) will engage and advise employers who still continue with such schemes to stop doing so. If they continue with the practice, TAFEP will recommend to MOM to take enforcement action, which could include the suspension of work pass privileges.",2,29,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00029
2022-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Manpower),"The Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness is deliberating on the scope and design of legislation to enshrine the TGFEP in law. The key objective of this new legislation is to provide a strong statement against workplace discrimination and broaden the range of actions that can be taken when workplace discrimination on the basis of characteristics such as age, nationality or race occurs.",3,30,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00030
2022-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Together with tripartite partners, we adopt a range of approaches, such as guidelines and education, that are effective in addressing various workplace issues. It is not necessary to rely on legislation as a solution to every workplace issue.",4,31,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00031
2022-02-28-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.,1,32,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00032
2022-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I just worry that if we just leave it as guidelines, it does not show that we are placing enough importance on this issue. There are workers that are out there who are sick, who are going back to work, so that they can get these attendance-based incentives. And I think the Government has to step in here to show that we are putting a strong importance on this issue and to protect our workers, so that at least when they are sick, they can get enough rest.",1,33,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00033
2022-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I think we can do that through legislating this into the upcoming legislation on workplace discrimination.,2,34,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00034
2022-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, in my main reply, I already said that from next year onwards, the TGFEP will deem such actions as contrary to the principles of the TGFEP. So, TAFEP will engage employers and recommend that they stop doing so or we will take suspension of work pass privileges as an enforcement action on employers who continue to do this practice.",1,35,2022-02-28-T-004-S-00035
2022-02-28-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current number of foreign remote employees hired by companies based in Singapore; (b) what is the number of foreign remote employees broken down by industry; and (c) what measures is the Ministry taking to discourage excessive offshoring of quality jobs.,1,36,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00036
2022-02-28-T-005,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),MOM does not track the number of foreign remote employees hired by Singapore-based companies.,1,37,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00037
2022-02-28-T-005,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"COVID-19 has led to remote working becoming more commonplace. This may prompt many companies to consider offshoring activities to lower cost locations, particularly for lower value-added work. This is not a new phenomenon. We have seen in the past, activities such as garment manufacturing and call centre operations being offshored to lower cost locations. At the same time, our economy transformed and shifted towards higher value-added activities such as Advanced Manufacturing and Fintech. This transformation created high value-added jobs in Singapore.",2,38,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00038
2022-02-28-T-005,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"As an open economy that taps into the world market, we must continue to ensure that Singapore remains the preferred location for trade and investment, and we need to continue to move up the value chain. The anchoring of global companies will help to preserve and also spur the creation of good jobs. Together with our tripartite partners, we will continue to help our local workforce to reskill and upskill for future jobs and skills.",3,39,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00039
2022-02-28-T-005,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"However, our success cannot be taken for granted. It is critical that Singapore remains open to global trade and be welcoming to foreign manpower that complements our local workforce. This is why MOM regularly updates our foreign workforce policies to ensure a high-quality and diverse foreign workforce together with a strong Singaporean Core. If we do not strike the right balance, firms will not only offshore the lower value-added work, but may also have to bring the higher value-added work elsewhere where they can form the best team. This will mean fewer opportunities for future generations of Singaporeans and is certainly something that we would want to avoid.",4,40,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00040
2022-02-28-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.,1,41,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00041
2022-02-28-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply. My supplementary question is as such  are such workers, foreign remote employees subject to foreign workforce levers such as levies and quotas, as well as CPF payments? Will there be plans for them to subject to such levers and CPF payments in the future?",1,42,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00042
2022-02-28-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, the answer to both the questions is no. I have covered in an earlier Parliamentary Question reply with regard to the types of employees who would require CPF contributions. However, if these companies should change the context of the contracts and the agreements that would attract levies and CPF contributions out of Singapore, we will review this. But, at this point in time, to both his questions, the answer is no.",1,43,2022-02-28-T-005-S-00043
2022-02-28-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether JTC's mandatory solar deployment scheme can be expanded to all tenants, with JTC offering (i) incentives for tenants with short remaining leases to make up for the inconvenience and (ii) to own solar installations and lease these to tenants with the shortest remaining leases.",1,44,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00044
2022-02-28-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether there are any plans to develop a set of landlord-to-tenant solar energy purchasing guidelines and to promote such arrangements, given the mutual benefits of lower-cost rooftop solar energy.",1,45,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00045
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 7 and 8 together, please?",1,46,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00046

2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. For commercial and industrial buildings which deploy solar power on a solar leasing model, the solar developers typically sell the solar energy captured to building owners who would use it to offset the electricity consumption in common areas. For instances where the solar installation is owned by building owners, the solar energy is typically used for common areas by the owners.",1,48,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00048
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Electricity charges and savings are negotiated between the landlords and tenants as part of their overall tenancy agreements. With this in view, it is not appropriate for us to provide guidelines on solar savings alone.",2,49,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00049
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Nevertheless, landlords can consider taking reference from practices established by JTC Corporation (JTC) aimed to encourage solar adoption. JTC adopts a two-pronged approach to encourage solar adoption amongst their lessees. First, JTC runs the SolarRoof programme. This was initially started to solarise JTC's own buildings. SolarRoof was expanded in 2020 to other buildings to make solar adoption more accessible for lessees, including those with shorter leases. Today, JTC's lessees can choose between two solar deployment models, both of which do not require any upfront capital outlay if JTC's appointed solar vendor for the SolarRoof programme is used.",3,50,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00050
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The first model available is through rooftop licensing, where lessees can lease their space to any solar vendor for solar panel installations in return for a rental fee. The second model is solar leasing, where lessees allow vendors to install solar panels on their rooftops and they pay a discounted rate on the electricity generated which offsets their electricity consumption.",4,51,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00051
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"JTC implemented the mandatory solar deployment scheme in 2020, as highlighted by the Member. This scheme requires lessees with a new or renewed land lease with JTC of more than 15 years, and with at least 800 square metres of contiguous rooftop area, to carry out solar deployment. Lessees can adopt the two deployment schemes under the SolarRoof programme if they do not wish to own the solar panels themselves.",5,52,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00052
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The Member will be glad to know that JTC is currently studying even more options to push solar adoption further, especially for lessees and tenants with short remaining tenures.",6,53,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00053
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The Government will continue to review ways to incentivise and promote more solar adoption, including co-creating solutions with private developers and industry players, as well as work with stakeholders to maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore.",7,54,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00054

2022-02-28-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister of State for her answer. Just one supplementary question which is in relation to creating incentives to retrofit, for those that are not covered by the mandatory rule where there is a new tender or new construction, for existing facilities where there is no mandatory rule. I think in some cases, there is an issue where the landlord is not incentivised to really do a solar deployment, which may be able to benefit the tenant. I am wondering whether this is something that the Government can look at in terms of specifying guidelines whereby the benefits can be shared by the landlord and the tenant  and there may be electricity generated that goes beyond what is needed for common areas.",1,56,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00056
2022-02-28-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Such guidelines may be able to incentivise both the landlord and the tenant to do a solar deployment in cases where it is not mandatory. So, is that something that we can look at?",2,57,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00057
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Leon Perera for his supplementary question. Please allow me to share that solar energy is currently the most viable renewable energy in Singapore and the Government is committed to continue to accelerate our efforts to promote solar adoption. We are on track to achieving the solar panel deployment target of two gigawatt peak (GWp) by year 2030, which is equivalent powering 350,000 households annually. In fact, since 2015, our solar installed capacity has increased by nine times to over 560 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the third quarter of the year 2021.",1,58,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00058
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Earlier, I cited JTC's mandatory solar deployment scheme. I would like to share that currently a total of 224 MWp has been deployed across JTC's industrial estate – 224 MWp, compared to the 560 MWp I mentioned earlier. So, it is about 40%. This includes JTC's vacant industrial land and buildings owned by JTC and its lessees.",2,59,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00059
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to assure Mr Leon Perera that JTC's mandatory solar deployment scheme ensures that the lessees, which means the owner of the building, solarise their rooftops in line with the national efforts to increase our solar energy adoption.",3,60,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00060
2022-02-28-T-006,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The prerequisite for the mandatory solar deployment scheme is established by JTC in consultation with the solar vendors. For example, as per current market practice, the typical contracting period for solar installation is between 15 years and 20 years, and a minimum of solar installation area of at least 800 square metres is required for the solar deployment for this to be viable.

And in fact, JTC is also engaging existing tenants in land-based facilities to explore the possibility of a license fee sharing model. And in addition, as part of the SolarRoof programme Phase Three tender, which was just launched in November 2021 three months ago, both rooftop licensing and solar leasing rates for shorter contract period options of less than 10 years will be made available.",6,63,2022-02-28-T-006-S-00063

To detect COVID-19 infections early and to minimise its spread, the SAF has also instituted regular testing and SMMs, such as smaller group sizes and mask-on policy where possible. Service personnel, including NSFs, who booked out of camps are reminded to adhere strictly to SMMs even when they are outside and to monitor their health closely. Those who fall ill, who are sick, are only allowed to return to camp when they have recovered. Those who test positive for COVID-19 are to adhere to the national protocols.",2,66,2022-02-28-T-007-S-00066

It has a long history, with complex relations with Russia and other states in the region.",1,86,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00086
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Ukraine became independent in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"In return, Russia, the US and the UK, via the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, ""reaffirmed their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (UN)"" – words which perhaps ring quite hollow today.",3,88,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00088
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Since then, the Ukraine has faced considerable domestic political turmoil, exacerbated by the separatist movements and tensions with Russia. Twenty years after the Budapest Memorandum, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 whilst the world watched.

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),The events in Ukraine go to the heart of the fundamental norms of international law and the UN Charter that prohibit the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of the international norms and a completely unacceptable precedent.,8,93,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00093
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"This is an existential issue for us.

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"That is why we are a staunch supporter of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.

Singapore must take any violation of these core principles seriously, whenever and wherever they occur.

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"First, whilst international law and diplomatic principles are essential, they are not sufficient. The Budapest Memorandum was supposed to guarantee Ukraine's security by three nuclear powers – Russia, the US and the UK. But agreements are only meaningful if the parties respect them and if they can be enforced. The invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how quickly a vulnerable country can be overrun, especially when confronting a larger and more powerful opponent. This is the acute reality for all small countries and Singapore is no exception.",16,101,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00101
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are stark reminders of this. You cannot depend on others to protect your country. Thus, we must never lose the ability to defend and look after ourselves. And this is why Singapore has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong SAF and to maintain National Service as a fundamental element of our nationhood. The capability of the SAF must be undergirded by Singaporeans' resolve – the iron determination of our people to fight and die, if need be, to defend what is ours and our way of life. Without such capability and resolve, no amount of diplomacy can save a country.",17,102,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00102
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Second, it is all too easy for a small country to be caught up in the geopolitical games of big powers. Small countries must avoid becoming sacrificial pawns, vassal states or ""cat's paws"" to be used by one side against the other. In a speech delivered in 1973, former Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew had shared his agreement with Julius Nyerere, the then-President of Tanzania, who had said, ""When elephants fight, the grass suffers"".",18,103,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00103

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Dividing and weakening an opponent internally, overtly and covertly, has become a standard complement to conventional warfare. Therefore, our domestic politics must stop at our shores. And I thank all Members of Parliament for adhering to this precept.

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Fourth, safeguarding one's sovereignty and national interests often requires some sacrifice and pain. The Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price for freedom with their lives and livelihoods. The rest of the international community that is taking a stand against naked aggression through sanctions will also have to bear some pain and pay a price. Singaporeans too must understand that standing up for our national interests may come with some cost. We must be prepared to deal with the consequences, to bear the pain, to help one another and to stand up together.",23,108,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00108

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"We also participate actively at the United Nations. Three days ago, a draft resolution was presented at the UN Security Council (UNSC) to condemn Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Singapore was one of 82 co-sponsors of this Security Council resolution. As expected, Russia, as a Permanent Member of the Security Council, vetoed that resolution. So, the resolution was not passed even though 11 of the 15 Security Council members voted in support and the remaining three members – China, India and the UAE – abstained. The UN General Assembly (UNGA) will be debating a similar resolution later today. General Assembly resolutions are not subject to a veto, but neither are they binding. However, as a responsible member of the international community, Singapore will comply with the spirit and the letter of the UN General Assembly's decision.",25,110,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00110
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Singapore has always complied fully with sanctions and decisions of the UNSC, but we have rarely acted to impose sanctions on other countries in the absence of binding Security Council decisions or directions. However, given the unprecedented gravity of the Russian attack on Ukraine and the unsurprising veto by Russia of a draft UNSC resolution, Singapore intends to act in concert with many other like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia. In particular, we will impose export controls on items that can be used directly as weapons in Ukraine to inflict harm or to subjugate the Ukrainians. We will also block certain Russian banks and financial transactions connected to Russia. The specific measures are being worked out and will be announced shortly.",26,111,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00111
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"We must expect that our measures will come at some cost and implications on our businesses, citizens and indeed to Singapore.

We are still in touch with eight Singaporeans currently in Ukraine who are spread across several cities. We are aware of at least one other person whom we are still trying to contact. Singaporeans' safety remains our priority concern. MFA has been in contact with them, and we will assist them wherever and however possible. We are also exploring options for them to leave the country if the situation permits. In the meantime, Singaporeans who are in Ukraine are advised to seek shelter in place, be vigilant and to heed the advice from the authorities.

2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"And I can tell you now, from experience, from the past six to seven years with the privilege of representing Singapore on stage, is that big powers and our neighbours and middle powers have also gotten used to the fact that it is not personal, it is professional, it is principled.

But it has not stopped us from being able to sit at the table, look at each other's eyes, shake hands, explain where we defer, why we defer and at the same time, to pursue areas of cooperation where our interests align and where our principles are shared. So, this is not new, this is not a new posture. This in fact, is a posture that we have adopted for every single year since we have been independent. And I am maintaining that tradition.",4,123,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00123
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,The second question  are the events in far away Ukraine possibly a model and inspiration or an invitation for similar incursions elsewhere? I will not speculate where other clashes will erupt around the world except to tell you – and I am sure you are also aware as a former diplomat yourself – that we are not short of hotspots in the world.,5,124,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00124
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Again, I will bring us back to this fundamental point that we talked about – deterrence. For deterrence to work, first, we ourselves must have the capability to defend ourselves. Nobody else will shed blood on our account. Secondly, having the capability – the arms, the ORBAT and all the funding that this Parliament provides to MINDEF – capability without resolve, without, as I said earlier, that iron determination to fight and die, to defend and protect what is ours and our way of life, without both capability and resolve, it would not deter anyone.",6,125,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00125
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,And there is one additional dimension  that your partner or your protagonist on the other side must also have arrived at that same conclusion – that you have both the capability and resolve to defend. That is how you secure peace in a dangerous world.,7,126,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00126
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"In the larger point I am making, is that, yes, we are standing on principle, and yes, we may even have to pay a price, but this is a price worth paying for the future existence, independence and prosperity of Singapore.",8,127,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00127

2022-02-28-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I would like to thank the Minister for taking a very clear, principled position and explaining how Singapore stands on this. I have two clarifications. The first is the United Nations has always been an important institution, at least for setting the benchmark against aggression. But would this send a message that it will be difficult to restrain big powers from engaging in acts of aggression and is there more the world community can do in this respect? I know Singapore is just a small voice in that, but is there more that the world community can do in this engagement?",1,129,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00129
2022-02-28-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second is, in relation to specific measures that Singapore may take, this will be elaborated on later, but I think it will be important for whatever we do in this message to send the clear signal that we stand against these acts of aggression and the UN Charter must be upheld.",2,130,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00130
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I thank Mr Nair for his questions. It is always difficult to restrain big powers or emerging big powers, who will always give precedence to their national interests defined on their terms. So, let us have no illusions about this. For what it is worth, having international law, having avenues of peaceful resolution on disputes, having the United Nations with its Charter, having instruments like the Security Council and the General Assembly, capable of establishing norms, capable, sometimes – assuming there is no veto – of arriving at Security Council resolutions, is valuable. As I have said, that is why we are such staunch supporters of international law and the United Nations. We have to be, because the alternative is ""might is right"" or the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.",1,131,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00131
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"But, my point is that you cannot rely on that alone. Every country, big or small, has to have the capability and the resolve to defend itself, then to make common cause on the basis of principle with other like-minded countries. And for what it is worth, try to establish norms of state behaviour. But human history is replete with conflicts, conflicts which when you look back in hindsight make no sense, brought far more harm than any objective that was sought at the beginning, or simply miscalculations.",2,132,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00132
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, again, I am making the point that for what it is worth, we uphold principles, we do not take sides. And that is the formula to preserve our future security and prosperity.",3,133,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00133

2022-02-28-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister for the elaboration and detailed explanation. I am thankful for the answers to my Parliamentary Question as well, wherein I asked about assistance to fellow Singaporeans who are embroiled in that conflict.",1,135,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00135
2022-02-28-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I have two clarifications. First is, I think both the virus and violence are taking a toll on the people in the Ukrainian region. So, it is going to be a great humanitarian crisis and the refugee situation in Eastern Europe will also be unprecedented. What can ASEAN and Singapore do to alleviate the situation over there, particularly, given that COVID-19 is still raging amongst us and there would be some need to render assistance in that regard?",2,136,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00136
2022-02-28-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, I am told that for small countries, we do hold true to the principle of international law and we denounce the notion of ""might is right"". But at the same time, we still need to know the lay of the land and navigate our way through. So, what are the implications in terms of international order, particularly for Singapore and smaller states, given this particular crisis that is unravelling before us?",3,137,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00137
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I thank Mr Zhulkarnain for both questions. He is right; the virus and violence are a perfect recipe of humanitarian disaster, which is occurring right now. I explained earlier in my statement that the Singapore Red Cross has contributed US$100,000. The Singapore Government will also contribute to that and I am sure members of the public will also be generous. And we will work through the Ukrainian Red Cross, the International Society of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.",1,138,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00138
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"At the ASEAN level, ASEAN has taken a stand that there needs to be mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. I hope there will be a humanitarian impulse from ASEAN as well. Specifically, for the citizens of ASEAN who may be stranded. I just want to share one little anecdote which also illustrates the point. I said that three Singaporeans managed to cross the border in a perilous time. I can say that at least one did so in a convoy together with Malaysian citizens who were crossing the border into Poland. And I thank my counterpart in Malaysia for that.",2,139,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00139
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Similarly, on the ground, I am sure we will continue to work with each other, look out for citizens of ASEAN and where possible, ""tumpang"", ""gotong royong"" and help one another. I think these are teachable moments, good opportunities for ASEAN to demonstrate value and solidarity with each other where it matters.",3,140,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00140
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The second question on what are the implications of this crisis? Well, as I said, there are multiple. First off, we already feel the economic impact and Minister Gan will be dealing with this later today.",4,141,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00141
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The abrogation of international law and norms is a clear and present danger especially for small states like us and that is why we have had to take such a principled stand. As I said, standing up for principle is not cost-free. So, we also have to be prepared for that. But, if the world continues to watch with folded arms, we are headed into a much more dangerous world.",5,142,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00142
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"After the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the establishment of the European Union, I think many people thought war on the European Continent was unthinkable. Clearly, that rosy view is wrong, and you are watching, again, war on European soil in an advanced beautiful capital today. The point is if norms are not complied with and if borders can be trifled with, on the basis of all kinds of justifications and sometimes even pretext, then it will be a much more dangerous world, and especially for us. So, bear in mind that, actually, we are taking a stand not just for this particular crisis, but we are taking a stand for our long-term survival, prosperity and peace.",6,143,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00143

2022-02-28-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two clarifications. One is on Ukrainians who are currently in Singapore. I would like to know how are we providing assistance to them if their Social Pass or work pass expires. Are we going to help them to extend, while their country is currently in crisis now? Does the Minister have the numbers as to how many Ukrainians are currently in Singapore, for whatever reasons?",1,145,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00145
2022-02-28-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Number two, what is the proper channel for us to channel resources to help now? The Minister mentioned about Red Cross is one resource. Will the Government have a concerted effort to have fundraising efforts from the public to help the Ukrainian, rather to have multiple websites and we do not know which is the one that is approved and authorised?",2,146,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00146
2022-02-28-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Also, currently, the Ukrainian President is calling for the foreign legion to help the country, for fighters to come in. If any Singaporeans were to volunteer to become a fighter to go to Ukraine, will the Government object or will the Government stop them? What is the stand on these things?",3,147,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00147
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"That is actually three questions. I do not have the figures on Ukrainians who are currently in Singapore and the passes that they are on. This is something which ICA and MHA would look at and I am not in a position to give any blanket assurances on that. I think I will also have to reiterate our long-held position that we cannot take refugees because we are one of the most dense cities or states in the world. Nevertheless, we will look at it case-by-case, depending on the merits of the particular situation.",1,148,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00148
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"On channels, my advice would be to support the Singapore Red Cross. I think that is clear, reputable and safe. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies were created precisely to have a role in such conflict situations. So, I would encourage people who are minded to provide humanitarian assistance to work through the Red Cross.",2,149,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00149
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"On the third question about the foreign legion, again, I will have to come back to principle. Singapore does not take sides. Singapore does not allow the import of foreign politics into Singapore's domestic environment. Similarly, Singapore cannot support the promotion or organisation of armed groups, whatever their justification, into other countries. Our long-standing rules and regulatory system must continue to apply. Singapore Citizens, your duty is to Singapore, to fight and die if need be, to defend our national interests and to take a long-term view of what our national interests are. So, I will leave it at that.",3,150,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00150

Will the Government be exploring the initiation of a common position on this very grave issue with the other ASEAN member states? Is that something that is being considered? Is that something that will be looked at, in spite of the challenges in doing so, which obviously do exist and that is very clear?",1,152,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00152
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Thank you. The short answer to that is yes, all the foreign ministers and our officials have been in intensive contact over the last few days.

May I ask the Minister, considering China's stand in the United Nations on the invasion of Ukraine, how would this affect our relationship with China?",1,156,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00156
2022-02-28-T-011,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Second clarification is that, would the Minister be able to clarify or explain what MFA thinks about Russia's statement that they will be ""putting nuclear forces on high alert"". What does that mean? Would Singaporeans who are staying in NATO countries be considered safe or would there be advice that they were to evacuate from those countries as well?",2,157,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00157
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, I am the Foreign Minister of Singapore and I would hesitate to speculate as to what China's full position and actions will be. But I can make the following observations. China abstained at the vote on the resolution that was presented to the United Nations Security Council.",1,158,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00158
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The second point is that China has expressed some solidarity, at least more so in recent times, and some sympathy for Russian concerns. My third observation is that I believe China does hold firmly to the principle of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beyond that, I do not wish to speculate but I do want to assure the Member that we have been, as always, in constant contact with my Chinese counterpart. In fact, President Halimah and I were in Beijing, I think just three weeks ago. I am not even sure that the Olympic truce has expired yet and I will not be able to reveal details. But we, certainly, had an opportunity to listen to the leadership of China's views on unfolding events. But that was three weeks ago, before the hot conflict emerged.",2,159,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00159
2022-02-28-T-011,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I do not want to speculate into the Member's second question about the impact of elevation of the nuclear alert. There are nuclear powers in the world. And every time a nuclear power gets into a hot war, we need to be very, very concerned. Beyond that, I do not wish to speculate except, again, to express our hope that there is so much more to lose from letting the situation get out of control. So, our hope is that restraint will apply, there will be an immediate cessation of hostilities and violence. I believe there had been some arrangements for negotiations to occur between Ukraine and Russia at the border with Belarus, perhaps today or maybe even as we speak. I hope those negotiations will bear some fruit.",3,160,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00160

Beyond declaring our principles, I would like to ask if the Government would review the ongoing initiatives and projects, whether economic, defence or cultural, with the Russian government and any of the government-linked organisations, especially for those based in Singapore, and decide after the review, what action it will take that will support the principles that the Minister had just articulated?",1,163,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00163

So, I do not want to run ahead and I do not want to engage in speculation but to just make the point that we have no quarrel with the Russian people. I think the Member was indirectly alluding to the project that we have on the Russian Orthodox Church building and I would imagine that this is a project which, in my own view, should continue because this goes beyond the politics and the conflict which is going on right now.",1,164,2022-02-28-T-011-S-00164

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, what caught my attention about the Budget speech was the Minister for Finance's characterisation of the Budget as a first step to renew and strengthen Singapore's social compact towards a fairer, more sustainable and more inclusive society. The Workers' Party agrees with this important direction in pathfinding the way forward for our little red dot. Workers' Party Chair and Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC, Ms Sylvia Lim, will speak further on this, with inputs on inclusivity and innovation in her Budget debate speech tomorrow.",1,170,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00170
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, there are aspects of the Budget that are of concern to us. We disagree with the decision to raise the Goods and Services Tax, especially at this time, and the Workers' Party Members of Parliament who speak after me will put forward alternative ideas for revenue generation.",2,171,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00171

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, the GST increase. While the GST hike was anticipated, it comes at a difficult time for our people. Inflation is on the upswing and prices are high. Supply chain disruptions are having an outsized impact on people's purses. There is real concern on the ground that the announcement to raise the GST will lead to price rises across the board. In fact, some price rises have already occurred, with speculation that these were in anticipation of a GST hike.",4,173,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00173
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party's position is that the Government need not raise the GST. There are other options for raising revenue. A Straits Times column last month discussed the urgency of rebuilding public finances in the face of Budget deficits and the drawdown of reserves. The GST was held up as being one of the largest and most stable revenue sources, difficult to replace with any other kind of tax. The impression created by the article and similar arguments was that raising the GST is the only viable option for financing offset packages for the needy and healthcare, and to balance the Budget. We disagree that there are no other options.",5,174,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00174
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party has previously raised several proposals in this House, both on taxes, as well as adjustments to the reserves framework. These options do not constitute a raiding of the reserves, as the PAP enthusiastically and inaccurately portrays. We have supported the call for fiscal prudence as a principle of governance. But we also believe that the judicious use of progressive tax measures can achieve wider societal goals in Singapore.",6,175,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00175

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government, for its part, has not rejected further wealth taxes outright but spoke of the difficulties of implementing some of these tax measures. These will have to be proactively explored, particularly in view of the limited impact of some measures announced in the Budget, which had been characterised as a tax on wealth.",8,177,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00177
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For example, on the additional registration fee, or ARF tier, for luxury cars announced by the Minister for Finance, a senior manager of a large car dealership which includes luxury vehicles in its stable, was asked if the higher ARF would curb spending on high-end cars.

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As the Government continues to explore wealth taxes, the Workers' Party's view is that a distinction needs to be made between different types of wealth taxes. We should recognise the legitimate accumulation of wealth through effort and tangible business activity, especially that which creates jobs for Singaporeans. Even as there remains scope for wealth taxes, the values of entrepreneurship and equitable reward for hard work can, nonetheless, be recognised and even promoted through tax rebates or relief for such individuals. However, wealth accumulated through capital appreciation should be dealt with differently and taxed accordingly in the name of a fairer and more inclusive society.",10,179,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00179
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The Workers' Party has also previously asked if we can tweak the reserves framework and the way reserves contribute to our Budget. We have proposed including a portion of land sales into recurrent revenue and also an adjustment of the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) allowed for recurrent spending to be raised to 60% from the current 50%. The Government has disagreed with these reasonable suggestions.,11,180,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00180
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In 2001, then-Prime Minister Goh referred to the reserves as a golden goose. The Workers' Party remains of the mind that we can continue to grow the golden goose, but at a slower rate. The impending population bulge for our seniors portends stress lines for our healthcare needs and our welfare system. The Minister projected that, starting from current levels of healthcare spending and assuming increases at a similar rate in the next 10 years, the Government could be spending $27 billion on healthcare yearly by 2030, compared to $11.3 billion in 2019.",12,181,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00181

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For the very Singaporeans whose energies contributed to the reserves and who have played their part to fatten the golden goose, spending for them in their golden years and at their time of need should not even be a question. Moderating the growth of the reserves also improves intergenerational equity and accounts for the changing needs of Singapore and its people.",14,183,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00183
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It must be noted that the Government has shown, over time, that they are of a similar mind. At the 2001 National Day Rally, then-Prime Minister Goh said that the reserves must be protected and fattened. However, changes to the reserves scheme have been implemented by subsequent PAP Governments. The 2008 change of the Net Investment Income to Net Investment Returns (NIR) with the immediate conclusion of up to 50% of NIR contributions from MAS and GIC and the inclusion of Temasek in the NIRC formula in 2015 were all deliberate moves. These changes have made the NIRC component the largest source of revenue for the yearly Budget from around $2 billion in 2006 to close to $22 billion for the upcoming financial year.",15,184,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00184
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This number will only continue rising. This is despite the fact that the Government's adjustments have slowed the rate at which the reserves grow. Here, I ask that the Government not rule out changes to our Budget framework. Just as we should not kill the golden goose, we should also not fatten the golden goose at the expense of the people's well-being.",16,185,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00185
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On the necessity of a GST hike, the Workers' Party has also made the point that the Government should lay out its revenue and expenditure projections for the rest of the decade. This is so that the necessity of a GST hike can be considered properly and with greater introspection. We note that the Government has resisted the publication of such revenue and expenditure projections, but the publication of such information is not unusual in other jurisdictions.",17,186,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00186
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Just last week, on 23 February, the Hong Kong government issued its budget statement.

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Can the Minister tell us why MOF does not make such medium-term forecasting a part of our public-facing budgetary process? And, more specifically, does MOF have such projections at least up to five years in the future? And what is the hesitation in publishing these projections? Doing so would allow the public to have an in-depth insight as to the need to raise GST and the sustainability of public finances in the years to come.",19,188,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00188
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The question of projections with respect to public finances must also be considered in the context of the absolute necessity of raising the GST at this point in time. For example, a Business Times article today advanced the view held by market watchers that Singapore could potentially make a net gain in terms of revenue from the global move to introduce a standardised minimum corporate tax rate.",20,189,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00189
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Even so, it is of little doubt that the GST has been put to good use by the Government to finance spending. But after more than two decades, its drawbacks remain. The GST is a regressive tax that hits lower-income earners harder. And this fact has been recognised since the GST was introduced in the early 1990s. My colleague, Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Ms He Ting Ru, will speak more about the GST.",21,190,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00190
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Like now, the concerns back in the 1990s were about the average Singaporean worker who was vulnerable to increases in the prices of necessities. Today, with offset packages targeting low- and middle-income Singaporeans, it is the middle-class that is particularly anxious. In spite of the headline-grabbing GST offset package announced at this Budget, there is an anxiety as to how much prices will rise in future over the period the offset package would cover.",22,191,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00191
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In addition to the concerns about spikes for specific Consumer Price Index (CPI) items, there are also concerns about minor price hikes across the board that will hurt cumulatively, not too different from the analogy of the frog in a pot of gradually boiling water. Should the aggregate of price rises be significant, the impact of the additional offsets may not be as optimistic as highlighted in Annex F–2 of the Budget Statement for 3-room and 4-room HDB households where the enhanced Assurance Package is estimated to offset the GST hike of 11.8 and 7.9 years respectively.",23,192,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00192

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"At this Budget debate, the Workers' Party will raise additional alternative proposals to raise revenue so as to stave off the GST hike. In particular, Sengkang GRC Members of Parliament, Louis Chua and Jamus Lim, would explore other levers for revenue generation. Apart from the reserves' framework, the alternatives proposed are not inconsistent with the principle that recurrent expenditures should be backed by recurrent revenues.",25,194,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00194

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Cost increases in electricity, gas and transport were thrust upon Singaporeans last year and over the last few months. Energy prices continue to rise. The enthusiasm with which the Government spoke of the electricity retail market in 2018 as a means to manage the cost of living has become decidedly more muted with the exit of multiple retail players. In December, the electricity tariff for households was raised by 0.6% and there was a recent revision of household refuse collection fees which took effect last month after a previous hike in 2017.",27,196,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00196

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There is also a pattern of increasing public transport fares over the last three years, as shown in information from the Public Transport Council. While adult card fares were alternatingly increased and reduced between 2014 and 2017, they were raised by six cents in 2018, a further nine cents in 2019 and then another three to four cents in 2020. While measured in cents, these increases are by no means small to many who have to incur these costs every day – not as a luxury or as discretionary spending, but as an unavoidable expense simply to get to work and back.",31,200,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00200

Just last Friday, all the other taxi companies announced that they would follow suit.

I would like to raise a few issues relating to the Committee.",33,202,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00202
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, in order for this Committee to be effective, the public should be clearly informed as to what evidence they would need to file a complaint with the Committee.

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, at a time when inflation due to the supply chain crunch is a real concern, some businesses may have good reason to raise prices, or a legitimate reason to raise prices. For example, because of the rising price of raw materials and not under the pretext of the GST hike. This may cause misunderstanding amongst the public about resorting to the Committee to investigate the price hikes. But if rising business costs are due to supply chain woes, then prices should correct in time and even fall as the supply chain crunch eases. If they do not, then it would be legitimate for the Committee to inquire why this is the case.",35,204,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00204
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Third, the Committee should look into the businesses that move to raise prices before the GST hike is introduced. It should not rule out looking into complaints of such pre-emptive price rises that try to bypass the Committee's terms of reference. SMEs, hawkers and sole proprietors should be allowed to respond to the Committee if they have been falsely or unfairly accused of raising prices.",36,205,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00205
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, the Committee should closely track price rises at heartland shops where many Singaporeans purchase food and essentials.

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party is of the view that the Budget is broad-based in providing assistance to individuals and businesses to address both immediate as well as short to medium term concerns. Specifically, it provides a useful transitional support such as the Small Business Recovery Grant to businesses in eligible sectors that have been hit hard by COVID-19. One input we have is to ask the Government to actively consider appeals from businesses that fall outside the eligibility criteria on a more flexible and case-by-case basis as far as possible.",39,208,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00208
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),We also support CPF transition offsets to help phase in the raising of employer and employee CPF contribution rates for senior workers.

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"What was not fleshed out in significant detail was the Minister's commitment that the Government intends to refine how Employment Pass (EP) applications are assessed to increase certainty and transparency for businesses. Even while it is a given that Singapore will always be open to foreign talent, we must always prioritise Singaporean talent who represent the Singapore Core. If a Singaporean can do the job or be trained to do the job, the Government should not inadvertently make it easier or more convenient to resort to hiring foreigners. I hope Minister will share more details of the Government's thinking on the new EP framework in his wrap-up speech.",41,210,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00210

2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In this regard, I hope the Minister for Finance can consider moving more decisively to ensure that Singaporean workers who take home less than $1,300 can rely on the PWM Credit Scheme to raise their wages immediately. With the PWM Credit Scheme as announced by this Budget, I would argue that this can be achieved forthwith instead of waiting for all PWM sectors to be rolled out incrementally before the low-wage situation for these workers is addressed. Let me explain.",43,212,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00212
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Assuming that we want to provide immediate relief to the 32,000 full-time Singaporean workers who earn less than $1,300 with a generous $400 a month wage hike for 13 months each financial year, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that it would require about $167 million year to significantly uplift the well-being of these lower-income workers. This sum would constitute 8% of the $2 billion set aside under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) Credit Scheme and only 9.2% of the $1.8 billion that the Government has committed each year over the next five years for this scheme. I hope the Government is persuaded to move quickly on this even as discussions on PWM sectors are ongoing. As they already earn very low salaries, these 32,000 workers can and should be supported with higher wages immediately.",44,213,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00213
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),A second intervention I would suggest for low-income workers amongst us concerns the changes to the Workfare Income Supplement.,45,214,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00214
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The Finance Minister has introduced a new minimum income criterion of $500 a month. There was no such criterion in the past. The Minister has said that the policy intent of this is to encourage part-timers and casual workers to take up regular full-time work.,46,215,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00215
2022-02-28-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, this new criterion will penalise part-timers and casual workers significantly. There are legitimate reasons why Singaporeans take up part time or casual work. Some may be caregivers who do not have the flexibility to take up the full-time work. Others may not be able to stand for eight hours a day, for example, in a food and beverage setting for various reasons, including their advanced years. For some individuals, full-time work can be gruelling; for others, retraining is easier said than done. Yet some others simply cannot find full-time work in the limited areas they are qualified for and take what part-time or casual work they can find.",47,216,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00216

Singapore's net carbon emission goal, as part of our green transition, recognises the important shifts that are taking place across the globe. The Budget announcement of a carbon tax of $50 to $80 per tonne of emissions by 2030 is consistent with a commitment to mitigate the climate emergency.

Going by the Government's own calculations taken in a linear way, it would follow that a carbon tax of about $ 75 per tonne could potentially increase utility bills by $2 a month. However, unlike the new tiers for personal income tax, the upper end property taxes and ARF hikes for luxury cars announced at the Budget, the Minister did not reveal the absolute quantum of revenue the carbon tax is projected to bring in up to 2030.",54,223,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00223

But it has also proven to be a priceless opportunity to reflect on the robustness of our social compact and the live reality of Singaporeans, particularly at the lower- and lower to middle-income levels. It is also an opportunity to reflect on our values as a people. How much do we value the efforts and contributions of those around us, regardless of social economic class or nationality? How does the Singapore system recognise the effort and labour of those who work with their hands like our conservancy and landscape workers, or those who invest their lives in looking after the needs of others or nurturing future generations of Singaporeans, such as our teachers and our nurses? What about our artists and sporting talents? And what about the foreign workers in our midst?

I echo the statement by the Foreign Affairs Minister that we are shocked and appalled by the blatant aggression and are saddened by the loss of lives and destruction there. It once again reminded us of the importance of our own ability and our will to defend our sovereignty and our independence. We must expect no one else but ourselves to defend what is ours.",1,239,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00239
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, the conflict may be half the world away from us, but its implications and ramifications will impact us in many ways, amongst others, its' effect on the global economic recovery as well as the elevated oil and gas prices. Can I ask the Finance Minister for an update, notwithstanding the Foreign Affairs Minister's Statement, as to whether the Ukraine situation will have a bearing on the Budget that he delivered on 18 February; and also, what other implication or impact will there be for our economy?",2,240,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00240

2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Social compact is not a new concept to us. It has always been the underpinning core values of the Government, manifested in many of our policy formulations. It is a vision that galvanises us as a nation and unites us in our commitment to care for each other. Yet, after listening to the Finance Minister's Budget Statement speech, the meaning of social compact took on a refreshed and more tangible feel and operationalised versions of sorts or more realisable.",4,242,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00242
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Over the last decade, countries and democracies around the world including Singapore, have been grappling with three deep-seated issues. Firstly, the widening income and wealth inequality brought about by globalisation and the proliferation of knowledge-based economy. Secondly, the stagnation of very slow wage growth for our lower-wage workers. Thirdly, climate change crisis. How do we manage the pace and the trade-off to pivot to a low or net-zero carbon society?",5,243,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00243
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Budget 2022 will stand out for how we have made decisive and bold moves to tackle these issues head-on and to build a fair, inclusive and sustainable society.",6,244,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00244
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),Let me start with the tax changes announced.,7,245,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00245
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In the Budget, we saw significant increases in the income tax rate as well as the wealth taxes  property tax, luxuries car taxes in the ARF. These increases will bring in an additional revenue of $600 million for the Government, not quite a needle-moving number that can pay for the projected rise in expenditure due to its narrow base. But it helps to steepen the overall progressivity of our tax structure and towards a fairer system.",8,246,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00246
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Corporate tax changes are also expected to come next. The two-percentage point increase in GST will happen in 2023 and 2024, by one-percentage point step each. Coupled with this increase will be the massive upsized $6.6 billion Assurance Package to cushion the impact of the GST increase.",9,247,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00247
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The GST increase and the upsized Assurance Package put together, actually further enhance the overall progressivity of our tax structure. This is because the Assurance Package will have more than adequate payouts and rebates to cover at least five years of additional GST expenses for the majority of Singaporean households and about 10 years for the lower-income households. The existing permanent GST Voucher scheme will also be enhanced to provide continuing offsets for the GST expenses of the lower- to middle-income household and the retirees' household.",10,248,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00248
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"On the other hand, the higher income and the wealthier will pay more GST, especially with the two-percentage point increase, as they tend to be higher spenders, bigger consumers and hence, will contribute more to GST.",11,249,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00249
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, over the last decade, we have been adding more social support features into our social security structure, which has helped improve the progressivity of the overall system, such as Workfare for the low-wage workers which, in essence is a negative tax; Silver Support Scheme, which targets Singaporeans in the lower 20% in terms of lifelong income; higher permanent GST offsets targeted at lower-incomes, seniors and smaller housing types; means-tested subsidies in public housing, healthcare, education, tilted in favour of lower-income and that majority of Singaporeans do not not pay income taxes.",12,250,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00250
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Taken together, it attested to the system of social compact that we have always wanted where the better-off contribute more and those with less contribute less and will receive more benefits and support to help them cope with life.",13,251,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00251
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In recent years, as income and wealth disparities continue to widen, the view that the better-off should contribute more in taxes has gained traction and it is heartening that in Singapore, we are also hearing calls from the high-income earners and those who are wealthy themselves. This reflects our values and mutual responsibility amongst ourselves as a society and as a nation.",14,252,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00252
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Of course, there is often this argument that rising income or wealth taxes may diminish our competitiveness, or that wealth is mobile and can be easily moved to a jurisdiction with no or low taxes. Yes, we have to be watchful of this possibility but we should also not underprice ourselves.",15,253,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00253

And this is the Singapore premium.",16,254,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00254
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),We cannot just count on low taxes or lower costs as a way to attract investments and talent. It is not sustainable. The significant moves on tax structure in Budget 2022 demonstrates our confidence and also our self-assuredness as to what Singapore can offer. We have to keep working on strengthening each of these fundamental propositions and not only safeguard but also keep growing the value of this premium.,17,255,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00255
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, the other major move in this year's Budget is in the uplifting of income for the lower-wage workers and to tackle inequality. In a globally connected and knowledge-driven world, those equipped with in-demand skills and know-how tend to be duly compensated for their expertise. Salaries of the top earners have seen their income rise at much faster pace. We are not averse to that. On the other hand, the incomes of our lower-wage workers continue to stay stagnant or not keeping up with the rise in cost to live a better life. We are concerned with this widening income inequality and that is why we have Workfare and other skills upgrading programmes, amongst others, to intervene and uplift the wages of low-income Singaporeans.",18,256,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00256
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In this Budget, we saw significant expansions to the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). It will be extended to more sectors with an aim to cover 94% of our full-time lower-wage workers and through an accelerated pace of implementation. The Government will co-fund the wage increase of low-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS). Businesses with workers earning up to $2,500 per month will be assisted with co-funding of 50% in the first two years and 30% in the next two years. Those earning between $2,500 and $3,000 will also receive support, but at a lower co-funding ratio.",19,257,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00257
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In a related move, companies who employ foreign workers will now be required to pay all their local employees at least the local qualifying salary of $1,400 per month. And to complement the Progressive Wages move, the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) will also be significantly enhanced. The qualifying income gap will be increased to $2,500 and also extending to younger workers, aged 30, as well as increased payouts amongst the various WIS enhancements. These various measures amounted to a very substantial package to uplift the wages of the lower-income workers about $1.8 billion per year over the next five years or totalling $9 billion for both PWCS and enhanced Workfare.",20,258,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00258
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Of course, fiscal interventions alone cannot be the only way to uplift wages. Businesses and consumers will also have to contribute their share to help raise the income of our lower-wage workers. And we should continue to encourage and support our lower-wage workers to upskill, so that they can also move up the wage ladder. Sir, this is a realisable step to strengthen our social compact and to tackle inequality.",21,259,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00259
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"On decarbonising Singapore, I applaud the bold moves by the Government. The announced carbon tax increases are steep, increasing five-folds, from $5 to $25 per tonne in 2024 and thereafter, by ten-folds and more by around 2030. It is thick enough to bite or hurt and can nudge and change behaviours and business practices. The sharp carbon tax increases demonstrates the Government's resolve to achieve net-zero emission by around mid-century.",22,260,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00260
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Since our founding, we have always kept long-term environmental sustainability in mind and, in fact, have been ahead of the curve. In the 1970s, we have already scaled up the greening of our island by sustained tree-planting programmes and safeguarding our nature reserves. We mounted ambitious efforts to clean up our rivers, build comprehensive sewage, waste infrastructure, amongst others.",23,261,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00261
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"But this coming series of carbon tax increases will be our most ambitious move. It will have significant cost implications to businesses and households. Hence, without transitory support, some businesses may not be able to cope and some may exit. So, I welcome the clarification by the Finance Minister that the Government does not expect to derive additional revenue from the carbon tax levy. The carbon tax raise will be used to cushion the impact to households and businesses, as well as make decisive investments in new, low-carbon, more energy-efficient solutions.",24,262,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00262
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, although Singapore accounts for around 0.11% of the global carbon emissions, we strongly believe in contributing to the global efforts and see it as our moral obligations as citizens of the world. We should leverage on this major decarbonisation effort to catalyse the development of the green economy and to entrench ourselves in this global green transition and to create jobs, create opportunities.",25,263,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00263
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on the current waves of cost increases. I have raised this concern in earlier Parliament Sittings, including whether we can delay the increase of GST, given the cost pressures at the moment. I thank the Finance Minister for listening to the feedback from Singaporeans and on the ground, firstly to delay the GST to start from 2023 and in two staggered one percentage point steps; and secondly, to introduce the $560 million Household Support Package to help Singaporeans to cope with their daily expenses arising from the current cost pressures.",26,264,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00264

2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Mr Speaker, I am also glad that the Finance Minister has responded positively to Singaporeans' concerns about the impact of raising GST this year.

2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Many Singaporeans feel that while GST increase is inevitable, it is better later than early. It is better to raise it in two tranches than two-percentage points in one go.",35,273,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00273
2022-02-28-T-012,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Most importantly, we will have a $6.6 billion enhanced Assurance Package to help most Singaporeans offset the impact of higher GST.

In other words, the subsidy that this family will receive is more than 10 times the additional GST they need to pay. Retirees living in 4-room flats will receive subsidies that can fully offset the extra GST they have to pay. For utilities, 1-room and 2-room households will receive rebates of up to eight to 10 months, 3-room and 4-room households will receive rebates of up to four to six months, and 5-room households will receive rebates of three months.",39,277,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00277

2022-02-28-T-012,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mr Speaker, Budget 2022 will be remembered for the significant tax changes announced. One of the main Budget announcements was that the GST rate hike will be delayed and spread out over two steps – one-percentage point per step on 1 January 2023 and another one on 1 January 2024. This move by the Finance Minister brought some relief to concerns amidst rising prices. We all know that it would have been more expedient for the Government to effect the total increase in one go and the earlier the better for the Government. But we appreciate the sensitivity shown to delay it and do it in two separate steps. So, this is appreciated.",1,287,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00287
2022-02-28-T-012,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, Budget 2022 takes decisive steps towards strengthening our social compact. It unveiled a slew of taxes that impacts the wealthy – ranging from personal income tax, property tax as well as luxury car tax. These taxes are expected to raise $600 million of additional tax revenue per year when implemented. Taken by itself, this amount may not appear large. However, property-related taxes such as Additional Buyer Stamp Duty (ABSD) have in fact contributed significantly to our revenue base over the years.",2,288,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00288
2022-02-28-T-012,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Let me share. In 2021, Stamp Duty collection increased to $6.45 billion, that means a $2.55 billion increase in one year as compared to 2020, and that is 66% increase in one year. ABSD was further increased just a few months ago in December across all categories except for first-time local home buyers. The ABSD rate for foreign buyers now sits at 30%.",3,289,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00289
2022-02-28-T-012,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"As ABSD targets mainly property investors, this has effectively become a form of wealth tax, apart from acting as a policy measure to cool the property market. Whilst I know the Government may not consider this as a stable form of revenue base for the Government, I think investors should not hold out much hope for the ABSD to be lifted, as it is now a significant part of Government revenue. In fact, we should expect more to come on the property front, including the low hanging fruit of injecting further progressivity to the basic buyer's stamp duty from the current 4% for properties valued at $1 million and above, for higher tiers to apply to more luxury homes.",4,290,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00290

It was only recently in 2017, when the top tier personal income tax bracket was increased to 22%. Yet, this Budget proposes to increase it again, further to 24% from 2024.

In this Budget, the Assurance Package – designed to cushion GST impact for middle- and low-income households, was boosted to $6.6 billion. Another $9.5 billion over five years is being set aside to support the Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplement scheme, benefiting 94% of full-time low-income workers.

The next story starts off well with how the Government's Temporary Bridging Loans (TBLs) and Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS) were going to help our local companies tide over the difficult COVID-19 times. Unfortunately, the relief was short-lived as the companies found their commercial credit lines with their banks terminated and transferred to the Temporary Bridging Loans (TBLs) and Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS) offered by the Government. I am sure these are sound credit risk decisions made by the bankers. But for the SMEs, they are in a tight spot. Perhaps there are misunderstandings in the implementation of TBL and EFS that needs both sides to dialogue and move forward. It would be interesting to see how many of such cases did happen.

In January, inflation clocked in at 4% compared to prices a year ago and the highest prices in almost a decade. Higher prices have been exacerbated by an overall increase in the cost of living in the city, which has already been rated as one of the most expensive in the world.

While the direction of inflation in the future is anybody's guess – and economists have a particularly dismal track record of predicting price dynamics, one that would make a weather forecaster blush – it would not be surprising if inflation remains elevated through till year end. Supply chain constraints have not resolved as quickly as previously anticipated; energy prices are high and could rise more in response to geopolitical tensions and the likelihood of global sanctions; labour markets are tightening, spurred by the global great resignation and lying flat movements.

There is a risk that inflation expectations have become unmoored from the traditional 2% health by advanced economies worldwide and is now permanently higher by up to half a percentage point, compared to prior the pandemic.

On its face, GST fulfills many of the criteria economists traditionally look for, in optimal public finance. It is efficient because taxing all of consumption usually does not distort spending behaviour compared to taxing income or other taxes specific to certain goods and services. It is broad-based, meaning that it can raise significant revenue across a large population and it is simple. Unlike income, we do not need to futz around with appropriate measurements and exemptions. You just pay a fixed fraction of what you buy, period.",17,376,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00376
2022-02-28-T-012,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While this is precisely why we do not rely on GST alone to raise income, there are also some problems. It is generally sound to diversify the Government's revenue stream as opposed to relying on narrow forms of taxation, more recent research has questioned whether consumption taxes are truly more efficient, especially if we relax some of the standard assumptions. But perhaps, most importantly, most people believe that it is actually easier to ensure that income taxes are progressive, that is, those who are better able to afford a higher tax burden, pay more. The GST is a flat tax rate applied to all purchases of goods and services, which hits lower-income households disproportionately more. In and of itself, it is, therefore, regressive.",18,377,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00377
2022-02-28-T-012,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The Government's solution to addressing regressivity has been to pair GST with a voucher system, where cash rebates of a certain amount albeit not matched directly to actual spending, are issued to lower-income households. This transfer can indeed be progressive and it may be the case that the overall tax system, even after raising GST, will remain progressive. But an increase in GST will, in and of itself, reduce progressivity, which means we end up less progressive than compared to the status quo.",19,378,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00378

This means that those earning more than around $2,800 a month – a decent but hardly comfortable salary – will face the full force of the GST increase once the transition period concludes.

We assume a reasonable loss of corporate and personal income taxes arising from the agreement of 20% and 10% respectively and full compliance of the corporate tax rate to the new global minimum for multinational corporations, which amounts to about the two-thirds increase in the effective rate from current levels. However, we allow small and medium enterprises to retain their current 3% effective rate. This could generate $3.45 billion.",30,389,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00389
2022-02-28-T-012,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Another lever which we call ""the wealth tax lever"" puts asset taxation at the front and centre of revenue generation. We adopt the Government's current threshold of 10 years required for land leases to be classified as permanent, above which land sales receipt must be fully channelled into reserves and extract just the first nine years for recurrent expenditure, while redirecting the remainder into reserves. We also incorporate the Government's proposed property tax changes expected to generate an additional $380 million. And finally, we follow the net wealth tiers that had been previously proposed in this House to derive revenue from this channel under very modest recovery assumptions and this could generate $3.7 billion.",31,390,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00390

To reiterate, we can reduce the share of reserves interest income that we send straight back to reserves currently held at 50%, to a lower but absolutely still respectable 40%. Importantly, this does not constitute a draw on the reserves stock. The level of reserves will not go down, but merely represents a reduction in the rate of accumulation of reserves and this alone could generate $4.31 billion.",32,391,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00391

We limit the increases in each of these channels to no more than 28%, which is what the GST increase will entail.

Deputy Prime Minister Heng had taken himself out of the running citing several reasons. Do not get me wrong. I respect the Deputy Prime Minister for that. It was an act of selflessness in the face of a force majeure, being the pandemic. In short, the Deputy Prime Minister said the next Prime Minister should have a longer runway to the premiership and a long run in the premiership. That he, meaning the Deputy Prime Minister, was not getting any younger and the pandemic was still getting longer. So, Singapore was at the heart of Deputy Prime Minister's decision.

Dr Jayakumar is not one to mince his words. He had to be as accurate in his analysis as he could be because many of the people that he wrote about are still alive.

First, the contemporary historian writes about people who are very much with us. You will see in the book that interviews form a very important source for the book and, of course, interviewees have their own views and they can read what you said about them, they can answer back. They might even be in the room when you launch the book. They might even be invited to launch the book for you.

I quote  ""There are many themes and ideas in this book and I do not have time to enumerate on all of them, but I did briefly want to highlight two points. The first is renewal – this is felt to be an urgent imperative. From the very beginning, Party files showed that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was thinking about the issue at an extraordinarily early point, from the early 1960s in fact. I really find this amazing. In this area of renewal, things that would see fruition much later, time and again, would be thought of by Mr Lee and others within the Party from a very early stage.""",10,413,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00413

In that election, many of the PAP old guards either retired from politics or stepped down from leadership roles. In the new Cabinet, from the founding generation – only Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr S Rajaratnam and Mr EW Barker remained.

Year after year, Singapore continued to sustain its strong growth and rapid transformation. We carried out two leadership transitions smoothly – from the 1G to the 2G, and then from the 2G to the 3G.

2022-02-28-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"My colleagues have and will continue to touch on these issues. But while this concept may appear to be remote in Singapore at the moment, I would also note that as we restructure our economy and society, we should be wary of allowing a situation to develop where political outcomes and opinions are, or are seen to be divided strongly along intergenerational lines.",15,454,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00454

Individuals, households and businesses have approached us for assistance with juggling the impact of relentless price increases.

They have also noted that there have already been price increases prior to the tax hike taking effect.",17,456,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00456

Furthermore, global brands such as Nestle have also sounded the alarm and announced that they will increase prices of their products – and these increments will not be captured by any GST Voucher scheme. I fear that the cascading and knock-on effect that such cost increases will be devastating on households already on a knife edge.",18,457,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00457

2022-02-28-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Already, crude oil has hit multi-year highs of over $100 a barrel and stock markets have reacted with volatility. Food prices will not be spared, as Russia and the Ukraine are major exporters of agricultural products, and Russia is one of the largest exporters of fertiliser globally – any drop in supply would lead to an increase in costs, which means farmers will pay more and have to pass it down to the end consumer. Russia is also a major supplier of natural gas, which has implications for us in Singapore, as around 95% of our energy needs are still powered by natural gas. This will only add to the woes currently experienced by our households and the businesses already grappling with huge increases in their energy bills. Notably, politicians in Germany are already advocating a natural gas reserve to shelter consumers from price shocks in the wake of the conflict. All this further underscores the need for our green transformation to take place urgently.",20,459,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00459

It is why the Workers' Party cannot agree to a GST hike – whether delayed or staggered – especially as we believe not all other alternatives have been exhausted. Yet we also acknowledge that there are long-term pressures on our public purse strings, as we search for a shift towards long-term sustainability on all fronts, be it environmental, demographic or economic. After all, the world cannot keep growing endlessly, a fact illustrated by figures released in November last year which have shown that India's fertility rate has dropped to below replacement rate for the first time ever.",21,460,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00460

The list of items should be kept to essentials such as food supplies, healthcare and care services, including childcare.",22,461,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00461

Exempting items such as healthcare, infant care and childcare will also help to ease current and future cost pressures in industries that struggle to fill their manpower requirements with local workers. And I note there are stark implications for those industries with the foreign worker policies which are being tightened by the measures just announced in this Budget.",23,462,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00462

I need hardly add that raising our TFR is an existential problem for us that we have been unsuccessfully trying to solve for decades.",24,463,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00463
2022-02-28-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Consumption taxes are regressive by nature. While it is true that exempting essential items from GST is regressive, the alternative of keeping our existing system of no exemptions is likely to be even more regressive. This is because those who are on a lower income spend a far larger proportion of their income on consumption, which is always taxed in our case. Therefore, exempting key essential items from being taxed will significantly reduce the impact on lower-income groups. Additionally, while it is true that higher-income earners also benefit from such exemptions, these items, being essential in nature, should result in any derived benefits being self-limiting – after all, how much more rice can a rich person eat?",25,464,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00464
2022-02-28-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Another argument is that it is too expensive to implement these exemptions and that this will increase compliance costs for businesses. However, with the advent of AI and advances in technology, these costs should be much lower compared with when GST was first introduced and any upgrades to accounting or associated software should be a one-time cost for both Government and businesses. Additionally, compliance costs will likely be of far greater concern to smaller enterprises, and I note too that small businesses with turnovers of less than $1,000,000 are not required to register for GST.",26,465,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00465

In particular, healthy GDP figures in 2021 and 2022, especially compared against the depressed bases in 2020, leave out the entire story of our country. There is a growing acknowledgement that beyond economic growth and survival, we should also thrive as a society and be mindful of the impact that we have on our planet. GDP measurements alone fail to address these shifting values in our current world. GDP alone also does not capture the full picture of how we care for our people.",30,469,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00469

A uniquely Singapore dashboard should, therefore, be developed and published together with GDP results.

These persons could be elderly parents or siblings who live with relatives as they need care or cannot afford housing. In some of these cases, they do not have means but because of their residential address, they do not qualify for any support. An example is the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG).

When viewed from a glass half-full perspective, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to tackling wealth inequality and strengthening our social fabric – albeit a small step.

This is significantly below what some academics have put forth as possibilities in our conservative estimates of what the net wealth tax could bring at about $1.2 billion annually. For example, in a November 2021 CNA article, Assoc Prof Walter Theseira from SUSS noted that a wealth tax might conceivably pull in a similar amount to raising the GST by a few percentage points, while a Bloomberg article on 16 February quoted Mr Christopher Gee, Senior Research Fellow at the IPS, as sharing that a similar wealth tax rate in Singapore, as that of Switzerland presumably, would generate $2.7 billion in Government revenues.",10,541,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00541
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Consider the case of property taxes which, as the Minister said, is currently Singapore's principal means of taxing wealth. As what Business Times' correspondent Ben Paul shared in his article, ""As an owner/occupier of a modest apartment in the core central region, property tax is not a particularly big expense for me. In fact, it is nothing, compared to the maintenance fees and costs of general upkeep for my unit.""",11,542,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00542
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While the increase in the headline marginal property tax rates appear high, the actual impact on the households involved are unlikely to be material. As noted in Annex C-2 of the Budget Statement, an owner-occupied condominium in a central location is only expected to see an increase of $200 a year while a very large, landed property is expected to see a $15,400 increase. The corresponding numbers for non-owner-occupied properties are $1,004 and $19,200 respectively. Based on my analysis, a centrally located condominium in Cairnhill that is being leased out as an investment property, only raised rents by 2% to offset the higher property tax rates while that of a luxury development located on Nassim Road commanding monthly rentals of almost $20,000 a month need only raise rents by 7% to offset the higher property taxes. To put into context, rents in 2021 for a private residential property already rose by 10%.",12,543,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00543
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The other tax change is that of introducing a new ARF tier for cars. For a Bentley Flying Spur, which retails for almost $900,000 without COE, the new ARF tier is expected to increase ARF by about $59,000, a fairly large number in itself but represents just about 6%-7% of the cost of the car. For someone who is prepared to pay almost $1 million for an asset that depreciates rapidly over 10 years, is it even meaningful in the grand scheme of things for this person?",13,544,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00544
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thirdly, higher personal income tax rates are not wealth taxes per se. But I do agree with the principle that those who earn more should contribute more and it is a fine example of what progressive taxes look like. However, the increase appears to be very modest once again, once you work through the mathematics. For example, someone making $1 million in chargeable income would pay a grand total of $5,000 more in personal income taxes, or 0.5% of chargeable income, while someone making $1.5 million would only pay $15,000 more, or about 1% of chargeable income.",14,545,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00545

Also bearing in mind that from 2015 to 2019, that is, the latest available year on SingStat, the number of individuals with assessed income of more than $300,000 has increased by 22% within this timespan as well.",15,546,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00546

And I sincerely hope that more meaningful efforts to change our tax system and raise wealth taxes can be made sooner than later. Yes, I agree that taxing wealth has its challenges. But consider a hypothetical case of a multi-billionaire tech founder who made a windfall after his start-up's IPO and has retired from the firm. From time to time, he collects dividends as his income while continuing to hold shares in the listed company, which accounts for the vast majority of his wealth.",16,547,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00547

A similar argument can be made for countries that do not levy taxes on inheritances. Singapore will fit into both of these cases as a country with no capital gains tax, no tax on dividends, no inheritance tax, no estate duties and still has one of the lowest effective personal income tax rates globally. We must guard against only going through the motions when we move towards addressing wealth inequality, while still leaving the least fortunate among us still pleading, ""Please, Sir, I want some more"".",18,549,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00549

2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I thank MOF and IRAS for patiently addressing my various Parliamentary Questions over the past year on this issue and, I believe, the various public officers involved have done plenty of detailed analysis and scenario planning on this issue by now. With less than a year to go before the implementation of the two-pillar solution and with OECD already having published in December last year the model rules for domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax, my question is, what is the Government's current estimates or range of estimates of the net impact of pillar one and pillar two to our CIT revenues?",24,555,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00555
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While Minister Lawrence Wong noted that pillar one will result in a negative revenue impact to Singapore, this is, firstly, limited in scope, as it is expected to apply only to global MNEs with a global turnover of more than €20 billion, with just around 100 of such companies globally. Secondly, it is only 25% of the profits in excess of 10% of revenues that will be allocated away. And, thirdly, I do not believe that profits are being artificially inflated here in Singapore, given rigorous transfer pricing rules.",25,556,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00556
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"On the other hand, for pillar two – this applies to a much larger group of MNEs. Any company with over €750 of annual revenue would now be subject to a global minimum corporate tax. In Singapore alone, the Government shared that there are over 1,800 such multinational enterprise (MNE) groups operating here that are unlikely to be affected. As I have shared in this House last year, I hope that the Government will view the global minimum tax reforms as an opportunity rather than a threat, given Singapore's strong non-tax advantages and attractiveness to MNEs, bearing in mind the current average effective corporate tax rate is closer to 3% in YA2019.",26,557,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00557
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"If we look at the subset of non-SMEs or those with revenues exceeding $100 million and making an accounting profit, then in YA2019, the average effective corporate tax rate is even lower, at 2%. Profitable non-SMEs contributed $10.4 billion or 64% of total CIT paid by all companies. If we assume a 15% tax rate instead, this could hypothetically balloon seven times to $71.5 billion. Of course, this is purely hypothetical, since obviously, not all companies will be scoped into the rules and there could be some slippage from both pillar one and pillar two rules and the actual impact will be much lower. But the point remains that, technically, even a small shift towards the proposed global minimum rate of 15% could result in significantly higher corporate tax receipts for the Government.",27,558,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00558
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Beyond the dollars and cents, the more important conceptual point to me is this  if a global MNE is already operating in Singapore, what incentive would it have to incur additional relocation costs, when the minimum corporate tax rate of 15% would be normalised globally? And with tax considerations out of the way, why would not a global MNE keen to tap on the attractive growth prospects in Asia, base their headquarters here in Singapore? The World Bank has consistently placed Singapore as among the best places in the world to do business and I am confident that our competitive strengths and strong non-tax advantages will continue to provide a competitive edge to companies seeking a place of business.",28,559,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00559
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Lastly, let me touch on the other elephants in the room, the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) and our reserves. It is comforting to note that instead of a $54 billion draw on the reserves, as announced in Budget 2021, the actual amount we utilised across three years was $43 billion, savings of about $11 billion. It was previously said that we have drawn on our reserves equivalent to over 20 years of past Budget surpluses. We have used a generation's worth of savings to combat a crisis of a generation.",29,560,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00560
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I asked Deputy Prime Minister Heng during last year's Budget debate, after accounting from the draw, where would our reserves be, compared to five years ago and 10 years ago, though I do not think there was a direct answer to the question. Hence, I would like to ask Minister Lawrence Wong, after considering the $43 million drawn on our past reserves, are our reserves today higher or lower, compared to five years ago?",30,561,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00561
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I ask this because it is important to put into context the growth in our reserves as we debate the source of funding for our future expenditures, even if the Government continues to be guarded over disclosing the absolute size of the reserves itself. It is not that I disagree with the need to be prudent and I agree we should not take our reserves for granted. But just looking at the MAS Official Foreign Reserves (OFR), they stand at around $566 billion as of January 2022, an increase of $185 billion or close to 50%, compared to two years ago. Temasek's net portfolio value as of March 2021 stands at $381 billion, up to $75 billion or 25%, compared to a year ago. And I believe GIC would have grown its portfolio as well, given generally supportive market conditions in the last two years.",31,562,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00562
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Yes, I understand that the design of the NIRC framework is to provide a stable, sustainable source of income to our Budget, smoothed out over market cycles. But it is also helpful to remind Members of this House that our financial reserves grow not just from the balance 50% of NIRC not utilised, but also from inflows directly into the reserves, such as from land sales which averaged around $13 billion a year in the past 10 years and from MAS interventions in the foreign exchange market to dampen appreciation pressures, given Singapore's excess of domestic savings, over investments and persistent capital inflow.",32,563,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00563
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"If the goal of this Budget is to ensure a fairer revenue structured, that means everyone chips in and contributes to a vibrant economy and strengthen the social compact, but those with great means contribute a larger share. If so, should we not revisit the contribution of our investment returns as opposed to the individual Singaporean who is grappling with the rising cost of living? Over the past five years, the NIRC provided an average revenue stream of around $17 billion, or 3.5% of our GDP. If the assumption is that Government spending is at 18% of GDP today, but expected to go to more than 20% of GDP by 2030, could we not raise the contributions from the NIRC to the Budget and raise its share of GDP too?",33,564,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00564
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I hope that Minister Wong will agree with me that raising the NIRC contribution rate will not result in a drawdown of the reserves and will, in fact, still allow us to continue building our reserves.",34,565,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00565
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"So, to belabour with the point, this will not mean that we will not get a steady stream of income from the reserves to benefit today's generation of Singaporeans and our children and our grandchildren. On the contrary, as Minister Wong has said, it is about being able to invest even more in our people and social infrastructure. It is to me about ensuring that we invest not only in financial assets overseas but in our people, Singaporeans, who to me are the most important resource of this country. It is simply about sustaining the value of our financial reserves and sustaining the lives and livelihoods of our fellow Singaporeans. Mr Speaker, allow me to conclude in Mandarin.",35,566,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00566
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] We are still in the amidst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While economic growth seems to have started to pick up again, there are also some underlying concerns. Hence, we are very concerned about the risk of raising GST when the pandemic is still ongoing and there are many uncertainties with the economic recovery. Instead of raising GST, Workers' Party Members of Parliament suggest that alternative sources of government revenue be considered.",36,567,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00567

2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Singapore has strong non-tax advantages and appeals to MNCs. Therefore, the Government should view the tax reform on global minimum tax rate as an opportunity, not a threat.",40,571,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00571
2022-02-28-T-012,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Finally, I suggest that we consider increasing the NIRC component to our Budget.

2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, giving his Budget Statement the title ""Charting Our New Way Forward Together"", the Minister for Finance devoted much space in his Budget speech to talk about the need for revenue to bring all the plans that he had laid out to fruition. That prompts the question  ""why raise taxes?"" This is a fundamental question in political economy. I think that we can offer three answers.",1,578,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00578
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"First, we raise taxes to create the fiscal capacity to support a well-functioning society. Second, we raise taxes to achieve economic inclusion. Third, and particularly relevant in the Singapore context, we raise taxes to pay for recurrent spending so that we can prioritise the use of our national reserves to manage external shocks as we remain integrated with the global economy.",2,579,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00579
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"First, building fiscal capacity. We can take a cross-country perspective and an intertemporal perspective. When a country's income per capita is low, the need to raise taxes is great so that the country has the resources to provide public goods like national defence, law and order as well as relief for the poor. Yet, the viable tax base is small because the tax administration and enforcement ability is low at this stage of economic development.",3,580,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00580
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Historically, countries that are starting on the path of development turn to trade taxes in order to generate government revenue to pay for their expenditure. Trade taxes have tended to make up a larger share of total revenue at the early stages of economic development because it is relatively easy to keep track of the flow of goods at major shipping ports. These countries then shifted to greater reliance on direct taxation of income which happened late in the 19th century and broad-based consumption taxes which happened from the middle of the 20th century.",4,581,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00581

It steadily declined through the decades and now make up less than 5% of tax revenue. Consumption taxes were introduced in Singapore only later in 1994.",5,582,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00582
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"There is a sense in which the way the tax revenues are spent, notably on education which has been a priority in the very early Budgets.

2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"As the human capital base is expanded, the size of the economic pie grows so the tax base correspondingly increases. At this stage of our development, boosting innovative activities will play a bigger role in growing the economy and thus, the tax base in the post-COVID-19 world. The support given in Budget 2022 to further strengthen the collaboration in engaging in R&D projects between SMEs and our Polytechnics and ITEs ultimately expands our fiscal capacity.",7,584,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00584
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"The initiative dubbed ""Singapore Global Enterprises"" provides fiscal support for our large local enterprises (LLEs) to break into overseas markets. As our LLEs expand into overseas markets and become bigger and more productive, they become more profitable and can afford to pay their workers more. It is a statistical and practical fact that larger firms doing the same business, tend to pay their workers more, because they are more productive and they tend to break into overseas markets. The tax base is accordingly expanded.",8,585,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00585
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"However, there are there are also factors acting to contract our fiscal capacity. One is the demographic transition and increased life expectancy. With a bigger share of the population becoming economically inactive, the tax base becomes relatively smaller. That is a fact well recognised by many.",9,586,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00586
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Another factor that can reduce our fiscal capacity comes from the harm that is caused by climate change, a point that many Members have alluded to. The proposed schedule of increases in carbon taxes introduced in Budget 2022 can be justified on the basis of helping businesses internalise the negative externalities caused by emission of greenhouse gases.",10,587,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00587
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Unlike a tax on labour income, as an example, which reduces economic efficiency because people respond by working fewer hours when their take-home pay is reduced. A carbon tax, nevertheless, increases efficiency because it reduces activities that society wants to reduce. Roughly speaking, an efficient outcome is for the carbon tax on firms to be set equal to the amount of external damage caused by the greenhouse gas emission.",11,588,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00588
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),Another point is that a carbon tax also has the effect of giving incentives for upstream firms to develop green technology by discouraging downstream firms from using devices that embody environmentally unfriendly technology.,12,589,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00589

2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Budget 2022 raises the marginal tax rate of the highest income earners, among other measures. While this narrows the income gap, there are microeconomic distortions caused by such tax increases, also called excess burden. It is a standard concept in public finance. The idea is that the quantity of an economic activity, such as labour supply decreases when there is an increase in income tax rate. In designing an optimal tax policy, the Government has to take into account the fact that raising the tax rate has consequences for the tax base because if the income tax on income earners goes up, as an example, they work less, the tax base shrinks, so there is an efficiency loss.",14,591,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00591
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Nevertheless, despite the loss in efficiency, every society has still got to choose a point on the equity efficiency frontier, sacrificing some efficiency in order to attain a desired level of equity. Since the excess burden of a given tax rate increase rises more than proportionately, it is optimal to broaden the tax mix from this perspective, such as relying also on other tax instruments, like raising consumption taxes and wealth taxes to pay for higher social spending. That argument calls for some diversification of tax instruments rather than a dependence on a very narrow particular tax.",15,592,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00592
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Budget 2022 seeks to avoid the regressive nature of the increase in consumption tax rate with the Assurance Package and by boosting the permanent GST Vouchers (GSTV). Since the beginning of the 20th century and especially in the post-war period, in international cross-sections of countries there has not been a clear negative relationship between the level or growth of tax-based social spending and GDP per capita. In other words, looking historically – particularly over the last century and across countries as a whole, broadly, the message is that the social cost of financing higher social spending through taxes does not appear to be especially high, although obviously, to achieve a certain point on the equity efficiency frontier, there is an efficiency loss and society has to make its own calculation.",16,593,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00593

Remaining integrated with a global economy presents Singapore with the opportunity to grow. It is undeniable that much of our catchup from third world to first world was facilitated by international integration, but the earliest stage was very much about technology transfer. In the next stage, we will have to generate innovative activities. But in order to have a steady contribution to growth of the economy, our firms will have to be integrated into the global economy, selling not only domestically but into the region and into the world as well.",20,597,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00597
2022-02-28-T-012,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"But remaining integrated with the global economy will come at a cost of sometimes sharp recessionary shocks. Responding to the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 and currently in the last two years, the COVID-19 health shock, if we were to respond to these negative shocks by raising taxes to finance the national efforts to save jobs, that would be tantamount to incurring huge excess burden on taxpayers – recall that the excess burden rises more than proportionately by every unit increase in the tax rate.",21,598,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00598

Much of real life is not well represented by the story of Robinson Crusoe, a story that we tend to use in teaching international trade in the classroom. He was, of course, a castaway who lived alone on a deserted island for many years. As entertaining as the novel by Daniel Defoe is, Budget 2022 is built on the premise that we can build a dynamic economy, although more mature now, we have transited from third world to first world, the challenges are bigger and we need now to generate our own indigenous innovation to propel the productivity growth that we will continue to need in order to grow the economy, in order that our citizens will flourish.",26,603,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00603

The additional personal income tax raised is only $170 million per year, which many Singaporeans cynically pointed out, was not enough to pay for the $180 million per year funding for SPH Media Trust. The Additional Registration Fee increases for luxury cars is not really a burden to the rich, because the fee is transferable to future owners.",2,607,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00607
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Not enough has been done on foreign manpower policy too. The increase in the minimum qualifying salary for Employment Pass (EP) holders is too little to be effective. I am also surprised that S Pass holders are needed in the finance industry where many Singaporeans are hoping to work. The more effective way to manage the quality of our EP holders is to ensure fair competition between the EPs and Singaporeans through imposing a standard wage levy on all EPs who do not make CPF contributions. If we impose a monthly $1,200 EP levy, as I had recommended in the Budget debate last year, and then again in the Foreign Talent and Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) debate, the levy will raise almost $3 billion and make the GST hike unnecessary.",3,608,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00608
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"As global inflation is on an upcycle, we will have to do more to help Singaporeans to cope with the rising cost of living and asset inflation. This is the best timing to share with Singaporeans a small part of the huge windfall profits chalked up by GIC, MAS and Temasek last year. However, not only did the Government not do that, it also increased the tax burden on Singaporeans. This is incomprehensible to me.",4,609,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00609
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The Government used healthcare costs as the main rationale for raising taxes. However, Singaporeans have paid and are still paying dearly for healthcare. Is it fair to ask them to pay more taxes for healthcare again, especially in these challenging times?",5,610,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00610
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Look at the facts  $100 billion of the Singaporeans' CPF funds are locked up in MediSave accounts, and Singaporeans contribute $10 billion to MediSave every year; $10 billion of reserves have been accumulated in MediShield and CareShield, while Singaporeans continue to pay $3 billion of CareShield premiums every year and the premiums are likely to rise every five years. Singaporeans also pay billions of dollars in private healthcare insurance.",6,611,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00611
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Singapore is actually in a very strong financial position. We have the resources to pay for even the large healthcare cost increases forecasted by the Government. Look at the facts again. The Government reported $1.4 trillion of financial assets as of 31 March 2021. This is an indication of the size of our national reserves. Our nation's financial assets are currently closer to $1.6 trillion, due to an increase of $200 billion of reserves over the last two years, despite and after the COVID-19 drawdowns.",7,612,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00612
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Net investment income from these assets is now more than $40 billion a year. Half of the net investment return, or $20 billion, is recycled back into the reserves. Another $10 billion of annual land sales proceeds is put into the reserves directly and not used for the current year spending. Thus, even without touching the growing reserves, we have a total of $30 billion of unutilised revenue annually, which can be deployed for the current year spending in the future. We can actually provide for our current generation while continuing to save for future generations at the same time.",8,613,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00613
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Hence, the Government's argument for the future generation does not hold water.

2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Of course, we cannot rest on our laurels and rely on our reserves and unused revenues all the time.

2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"While the Government has been running Budget surpluses these years, public spending cuts have not been discussed openly. Our Budget has increased by about 7% per year over the last two decades to about $100 billion for FY2022. There is, thus, ample room for us to cut down on existing spending.",11,616,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00616
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The Finance Minister has disclosed he is imposing a 3% cut on existing expenditure from next year. If he can achieve that every year, we will have a saving of $3 billion per year. Again, there is no need for the GST hike. We can probably do more cuts than 3%.",12,617,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00617
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"We advocate setting clear socio-economic targets for each expenditure. That is the reason we supported the SINGA scheme, which will bring big infrastructural projects under stricter financial discipline. For example, many Singaporeans are asking, what are the socio-economic targets for SPH Media Trust, to which the Government is committing $900 million over the next five years? How about the billions of dollars of taxpayer money spent on local Universities that have relied heavily on foreign talent, but do not seem to be producing sufficient local skills and talent needed for our economy? When public funds are used to support or rescue a commercial organisation, are there plans to claw back the funds when the commercial organisation starts to make money?",13,618,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00618
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"For the COVID-19 spending, many Singaporeans have questioned why the $30 billion Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) is used to support profitable companies without a claw back feature. The clawed back funds could have been used to help many more Singaporeans who needed help. So, as the amount of resources at the disposal of the Government grow larger, we need to check on the expenditures more closely.",14,619,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00619
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"We are also against the goody bag approach that is adopted by the Government to convince Singaporeans to accept the GST hike. Handing out short-term ad hoc goodies to Singaporeans instead of using permanent schemes, will not produce resilient Singaporeans but dependent Singaporeans. Let me give you a specific example. I have been recommending a minimum living wage of $1,800 per month in take-home pay for all Singaporean workers. This works out to about $2,250 in gross wage per month. This may appear high, but if you add Workfare Supplement, GST Voucher (GSTV), U-Save rebate, CDC Voucher, and now, Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS), you could easily reach the $2,250 gross wage per month.",15,620,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00620
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Hence, instead of handing out drips and drabs to Singaporeans, the Government could have provided a lump sum to top up the average worker's gross wage to $2,250 per month. A permanent monthly wage of $2,250 will give workers more clarity in making personal financial plans for himself and for his family. That is how we make Singaporeans more resilient.",16,621,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00621
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, in conclusion  one, the PSP does not support this Budget because there is no need for the GST hike; two, our country is in a very strong financial position, but Singaporeans need all the help they can get to overcome their current financial challenges; three, with this Budget, the Government is asking Singaporean to tighten their belts again while it sits on massive reserve and unutilised revenues; four, as Singaporeans are already burdened with high healthcare cost, the Government should first control the escalating cost of healthcare by changing the way our healthcare system works; and finally, PSP thinks that Singapore can have a new financial compact which is better than this Budget. Speaker, Chinese, please.",17,622,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00622

At a time when Singaporeans are still facing various difficulties, we should try to come up with better fiscal solutions to help them.

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Leong Mun Wai mentioned that the GST hike will result in $1.2 billion in tax burden on middle-class Singaporeans in the long run. Can he share with us how he got that $1.2 billion figure as I do not seem to be able to find it in published material?,1,632,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00632
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I thank the Member Mr Saktiandi for the question. Speaker, I got the data by calculating from the ratio given by the Minister for Finance in terms of the share of the GST paid by the top 20% and the bottom 80%. It was in the ratio of 60% 40%. So, 40% to the bottom 80% and 60% to the top 20%. If the total amount of GST revenue to be raised from a two-percentage point increase in GST, will be about $3 billion, so, 40% of $3 billion, I got my $1.2 billion. Yes, that is how I got my $1.2 billion.",1,633,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00633
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Sir, I have a second additional clarification, please. Can I ask Mr Leong whether he can confirm that his calculations do not take into account the amounts that middle-income residents of Singapore will receive under the Assurance Package and the permanent GSTV scheme? I just want to confirm that his calculations do not include those.",1,634,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00634
2022-02-28-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker, yes, the calculations do not take that into consideration. But I presume that the GST Vouchers and all the compensation payments will only apply to the lower-income Singaporeans. There are some applying to the middle-income, but the permanent GST Vouchers belong to only to the lower-income. So, at the end of the day, when the Government argues that this is not regressive, it is not true, because apart from the top 20%, who are the people who are there, the remaining 40% of the GST increase? It must be the middle class Singaporeans. I hope that answers Mr Saktiandi Supaat's question.",1,635,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00635
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I thank Mr Leong for his answer. The reason why I asked is that I just want to have an understanding. The way I interpret the Budget booklet and the Statement that Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted is that the Assurance Package and the permanent GSTV in some ways neutralise the impact on the majority, including the middle-income as well. Mr Speaker, let me proceed with my speech.",1,636,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00636

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"In my speech, I will start by addressing the concerns of Singaporeans namely the middle-income segment amid rising costs of living – including the GST increase, and one of the reasons why I sought clarifications from Mr Leong is because the middle-income segment is something that will be a theme in my speech, Mr Speaker – and the need to focus on real wage growth to combat rising costs. I will then turn to the brave decisions we are taking to build a fair, inclusive and sustainable society. Thereafter, I will round up with some thoughts on maintaining Singapore's hub status.",3,638,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00638
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"First, on the rising costs of living. As the economy recovers from COVID-19 both domestically and globally, we can expect inflationary pressures to drive prices up. MAS is projecting a 2% to 3% increase in prices this year, led in part by rising energy prices due to geopolitical tensions, continuing supply bottlenecks and a recovery in global demand.",4,639,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00639
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Against this backdrop of rising costs of living, the GST increase has generated great public attention. The GST was last raised to 7% in 2007, some 15 years ago. While the increase to 9% – announced as early as 2018 in light of our ageing population and increased healthcare and social spending – will still be lower than the GST or VAT in many other countries such as Australia and the UK, but it is still a very visible price increase for the average Singaporean and Singaporeans are understandably concerned.",5,640,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00640
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"In this regard, I would like to thank the Minister for Finance for pushing back the start date and also staggering the GST increase across 2023 and 2024, as well as topping up the $6 billion Assurance Package that was announced in 2020, where the distribution of cash, rebates and vouchers will help households to offset five to 10 years of additional GST expenses.",6,641,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00641
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"But we cannot just stop there. To help Singaporeans cope with rising costs of living in a sustained manner, we must focus on growing their wages. Based on MOM's data, the real growth in our full-time employed resident's median gross monthly income has slowed down in the last five years. This looks at the income of a typical worker in the middle, after all workers are ranked by their income. After adjusting for inflation, the median gross monthly income has only increased 2.1% year-on-year between 2016 and 2021, down from 3.1% in the 2011 to 2016 period.",7,642,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00642
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, so, middle-income households also require more help, not just the low-income. The last two years have not been easy for everyone. While I am happy to hear that we will uplift lower-wage workers by extending the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to security officers, drivers and workers in the retail and food services sector, what are we doing to boost the wages of our middle-income workers?",8,643,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00643
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"On that note, I have a few suggestions to make.",9,644,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00644
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"One, as a start, and probably to nudge the public and private sectors, we could raise the salaries of our frontline workers, regardless of whether they are lower-wage workers. I am mindful that it needs to be paid from somewhere. This includes our wider range of healthcare workers and Adult Educators (AEs) who are private-sector individuals working across the Early Childhood, Student Care, Universities, Private Education Institutions and International Schools and who are represented by the NTUC-affiliated Education Services Union (ESU). The nature of their occupation meant that these AEs, who are largely aged 35 and above, were one of the first to return to their workplaces as this pandemic dragged on. Increased remuneration would recognise their invaluable societal contributions in this pandemic and extend our appreciation to them like how we did for our nurses last year.",10,645,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00645
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Second, I also welcome the raising of the minimum qualifying salary for foreigners to work in Singapore on Employment Passes (EP) or S Passes. Theoretically, this means that jobs which previously paid between the old and new salary thresholds – which could have gone to a foreign employee previously – will now have to filled by a local.",11,646,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00646
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"However, will the Government consider further differentiation of sectors beyond just carving out the financial services sector? Different sectors pay vastly different salary scales and the point at which they require foreign labour or expertise may vary significantly. Having a single uniform qualifying salary may also penalise sectors where Singaporeans are less interested in those jobs, while those employers cannot get pass holders to do the jobs.",12,647,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00647
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Third, another way to raise wages is to ensure that our workers can quickly and smoothly transition from their existing industry – which may be a sunset industry with stagnating wages – to emerging growth areas. In facilitating our current and future workers' transition and upskilling, why is there no further focus on the Professional Conversion Programme or the Capability Transfer Programme in this year's Budget? Over the years, I see value in these programmes, especially as we face the risk of structural unemployment and an economy in transition and faced with global disruptions. How are these programmes going to sit alongside the new SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme announced by the Minister for Finance?",13,648,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00648
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Fourth, given the context of an economy in transition, individuals may experience volatility in income levels or in employment altogether. It may be useful to relook at the option of assessing personal income tax on a current-year, pay-as-you-earn basis. And I have mentioned this in many of my Budget debate speeches. It is like a broken record; I have been raising this point. This is as opposed to a preceding-year basis, this system can help taxpayers – a significant proportion being middle- and upper-middle income Singaporeans – so that they can better manage their cash flow by matching tax payments with contemporaneous income.",14,649,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00649
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Finally, we cannot forget our freelancers. Before the pandemic, the number of freelancers was already on the rise, reaching 8% of Singapore's working residents. Through the pandemic, I have heard from residents that they or their family members have turned to delivery and private hire driving ""gigs"". The launch of apps to connect gig workers and clients have only accelerated the growth of freelancing.",15,650,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00650
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"As an advisor to the NTUC-affiliated Education Services Union (ESU), one of the first groups of people that come to my mind are the private-sector individuals working across the Early Childhood, Student Care, Universities, Private Education Institutions and International Schools – otherwise known as AEs. The nature of the sector lends itself to freelancing as training providers and institutions are increasingly reluctant to hire these individuals as employees. Some AEs may even be compelled to start their own sole proprietor company and enter a business-to-business transaction just to get the job.",16,651,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00651

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Unlike employees who have some protections under employment law, freelancers often fall back on contractual terms that they agree with their clients.

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"For AEs in particular, I understand that the ESU is currently working with SkillsFuture Singapore to formulate Tripartite Standards for freelance AEs.

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Besides being a fair and inclusive society, we also want to be a sustainable community. Just last month, many Members, including myself, spoke on the Motion for an ""inclusive transition"" to a low-carbon society. I am grateful that the Government has taken on board the suggestion to announce our carbon tax plans in advance, in order to give businesses the runway to plan ahead.",23,658,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00658
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"While the contemplated measures to help businesses – such as emissions allowances and support for green investments – are welcome, are we also looking at adjustment measures to prevent carbon leakage to other countries with ""looser"" requirements? For example, Indonesia's carbon tax is going to be set at US$2.10 per tonne, come April 2022. If businesses simply ""offshore"" their operations away from Singapore, not only do we lose jobs associated with such operations, we may also fall short of our goal to manage climate change. In addition, further details would be useful to assuage concerns that exemptions to companies using LNG, diesel and petrol may undermine our efforts in this space.",24,659,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00659

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I had previously mentioned in the House that the global carbon credit market could be worth more than US$50 billion come 2030. In our efforts to build a carbon trading ecosystem in Singapore, as we are in such early stages, I would suggest organising a dedicated inter-agency taskforce now to coordinate these efforts. The creation of a vibrant marketplace with many active participants depends on a range of issues that we will need our different agencies to work out. I will be filing a cut on this during the Committee of Supply debate to address this in greater detail.",27,662,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00662

What are the Government's plans to preserve Singapore's attractiveness as an investment destination in view of this erosion of our corporate tax competitiveness? Is it possible to repackage some of these tax incentives, so that agencies like the Economic Development Board (EDB) can still continue to have these ""carrots"" in the bag as they pitch to foreign investors? What will happen to the investment tax credits with the changes?",28,663,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00663
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"The fairness of the global tax reform under BEPS 2.0, and the achievement of its stated aims, will depend on exactly how individual countries choose to implement the two pillars. As we consider our own implementation steps, I hope we can adopt a ""wait and see"" approach – to consider how other countries are implementing BEPS 2.0 before tailoring our implementation steps in tandem, rather than pioneer an implementation model ahead of the rest of the world. Operationally, supposedly 1,800 companies are going to be affected, but no indication which sectors and type of companies they are and how hard they will be hit.",29,664,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00664

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Sir, given the statements and information previously provided by MOF, I think that statement is neither a fair nor an accurate assessment. As you can see – and I have mentioned it earlier at the start of my speech and previous Budget speeches mentioned by Minister Lawrence and other Ministers for Finance, I have requested for more help to be given to the middle-income. I recalled in her response speech to an Adjournment Motion on ""Taxation for a Dynamic and fair 21st Century Economy"" just three months ago, Second Minister for Finance, Ms Indranee Rajah, clarified that over 60% of the net GST from households and individuals is estimated to be collected from the top 20% of resident households, foreigners residing in Singapore and tourists. That was not the first time this information has been given to the House. The Deputy Prime Minister Heng also highlighted this two years ago in his 2020 Budget debate response speech.",31,666,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00666
2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Also, all the Finance Ministers have explained that the Assurance Package will cover the majority of Singaporeans for five years' worth of GST increase and the lower-income for at least 10 years' worth. This, effectively, neutralises the GST increase for these groups for those durations and, in some cases, for even longer; and not to mention the permanent GSTV scheme which will add on to that Assurance Package as well.",32,667,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00667

2022-02-28-T-012,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I am also heartened that, under the Assurance Package, the majority of households will get five years' worth of offsets and the lower-income will get at least 10 years' worth of offsets. For example, let us take a Singaporean couple with two young children, who live in a 4-room HDB flat and earn the combined household income of $8,000 per month. Even though they would have to pay $806 in additional GST per year with the GST increase, they could receive payments and rebates of $3,850 over five years under the enhanced $6.6 billion Assurance Package.",36,671,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00671

2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Mr Speaker, Sir, we currently are at the height of the Omicron wave. I know many residents who contracted Omicron or know someone who has. But Omicron too, will pass.",1,725,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00725
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"If the experience of US and Europe is applicable, Singapore will be in better shape within weeks or months. And once we get pass Omicron, experts globally have forecast a period of relative stability for this year, compared to the challenging last two years.",2,726,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00726
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Therefore, it is time for us to start considering how to best encourage Singaporeans involved in COVID-19 management to go back to their industries.",3,727,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00727
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"When COVID-19 first struck around Budget 2020's period of time, I asked the Government to hire many displaced Singaporeans, especially mid-careers Singaporeans. There are others who made the same suggestion. Our Government wisely hired many Singaporeans to implement SMMs, to supplement our healthcare and social services, and to help our migrant workers cope.",4,728,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00728
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"With Omicron, the situation is now quite different. A large part of our SMMs may no longer be as preventing the hyper-contagious Omicron and we have to learn to coexist with COVID-19. And today, most of our industries are in a much better shape compared to 2020 and 2021. In fact, some industries are experiencing a shortage of staff. This contributes to rising business cost. This leads to higher domestic inflation.",5,729,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00729
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Of course, a large part of this inflation we see is largely due to global supply bottlenecks, as well as surging energy costs.",6,730,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00730
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"But getting a number of Singaporeans currently involved in COVID-19 management back to the industries will certainly help our companies better manage manpower cost, thereby mitigating the rising cost of living.",7,731,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00731
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Also, MOF's spending has done an exceptional job in preventing economic scarring in the lives of our people. I believe it is also equally important that these Singaporeans I mention do not stay away from their respective industries for too long, which diminishes their skills in the long run. And this is all the more important, because I believe our local labour supply will stop growing within a few years, even after the planned increase in retirement and re-employment ages.",8,732,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00732
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"To be clear, I am not suggesting transiting everybody transiting back to their private sector from this group of people involved in COVID-19 management.",9,733,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00733
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"A core team can remain. The rest can transit back in phases, based on whether their previous industries are ready for them and whether they need to be reskilled before going to a different one. We can also supplement this core team with non-Singaporeans from neighbouring countries, much like how non-Singaporeans serve as Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) in some situations to supplement our Singapore Police Force (SPF) officers. And the non-Singaporeans involved in COVID-19 management can be brought in using additional work pass or S Pass, but with clear sunset clauses that their permits are tied to whether or not there is a continued need for COVID-19 management.",10,734,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00734
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"That brings me to my next point about reducing the cost and complexity for businesses through a decisive streamlining of safe management measures (SMMs), so as to fight rising inflation. Our Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) chairs have done an excellent job simplifying our SMMs and healthcare protocols as the virus evolves.",11,735,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00735
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Recently, our Minister for Finance and other MTF Ministers have indicated that they will do a thorough review of SMMs after the Omicron wave subsides. I am in full agreement. Let us go decisive on this. I hope our MTF can come up with a carefully considered list of ""no-go"" activities and settings, but allow everything else to proceed. Such clarity will help our civil servants achieve a quick, decisive but effective relaxation of SMMs when the time is right.",12,736,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00736
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"My final point is about our SG Green Plan and our participations in climate change negotiations. Over the past few months, I have met a number of Singaporeans and international climate change groups and organisations, and recently many of them told me they were absolutely delighted to hear about our new net-zero pledge.",13,737,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00737
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Given that I have spoken on a number of occasions about the importance of carbon offsets and carbon trading, I am also heartened to hear that our Government was involved in the negotiation of Article 6 of COP26, because it unlocks the possibility for Singapore to fight climate change internationally, while having this contribution potentially recognised under our National Determined Contributions (NDCs).",14,738,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00738
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Article 6, as it stands today, mentions bilateral negotiation, but based on my understanding, without mentioning a large number of details, if bilateral negotiations determine how two countries, the one that contributes to projects and the other where the project is based, splits contributions to their respective NDCs, then I hope our Government can start bilateral negotiation with a sizeable number of countries, some from our immediate region and some from beyond. Doing so will ensure that our overseas climate contributions are not all in one single basket, so to speak and will not be disadvantaged in negotiations with any one country in the future.",15,739,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00739
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Mr Speaker, let me now conclude with a few general remarks on our Budget.",16,740,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00740
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Many people I spoke to were relieved to hear that the GST increase will be staggered and only starting in 2023, especially given where inflation is today. Tax increases are never popular. But many Singaporeans acknowledge our pressing and fast-growing needs. Just to name a few – it is not just increasing healthcare costs, it is not just paying for ageing infrastructure, it is not just investing for future capabilities. But, let us not also forget that there will be less Singaporeans working in the future to support more people. Less Singaporean taxpayers supporting more people.",17,741,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00741
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"By now, many Singaporeans are aware that our uniquely Singaporean GST model is progressive. It is, in fact, a tiered GST system where the well-to-do pays more. Some careful observers are also heartened to see that the Government took a number of other steps first before implementing the GST which affects many Singaporeans. These steps include  one, financing long-term lumpy infrastructure projects through bonds; two, transferring a sizeable amount of MAS foreign reserves to GIC, so that we can generate more future income through our reserves; three, implementing wealth tax in a measured and practical way; and four, getting the very successful to contribute their fair share of income tax.",18,742,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00742
2022-02-28-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"All these show that our Government has listened carefully to people from all walks of life, balanced our country's needs with the complex global situation and come up with practical ways to make Singapore better. With that, I offer my strong support for this Budget.",19,743,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00743

2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak at the Budget debate. I rise in support of the Budget. Please allow me to speak on the impact the conflict in Ukraine has on Singapore's economy. I will also respond to Members' comments on what we can do to help businesses and Singaporeans to cope with the rising inflation and the challenges ahead.",1,745,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00745
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Let me start with the situation in Ukraine. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, had earlier delivered a Ministerial Statement on the matter. I will focus on its potential impact on Singapore's economy.",2,746,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00746
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"We are closely monitoring the rapidly unfolding situation. Our initial assessment is that the immediate and direct impact on our economy and firms has been manageable for now. Singapore companies have a limited presence in Ukraine, and we do not import many essential supplies from Ukraine and the region. We have adopted a multi-prong strategy to manage supply chain risks, especially for essential goods which we had enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes diversifying our imports, stockpiling and producing locally where viable, and working with major importers and retailers to ramp up supply from alternative sources if necessary.",3,747,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00747
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Having said that, the conflict is still evolving and the situation could change very quickly. Make no mistake. While Ukraine may seem very far away from Singapore, the conflict there will have real and significant impact on all of us.",4,748,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00748
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"With the sanctions being imposed on Russia by various countries and the disruption to supplies, global prices of energy and other products are set to rise in the coming weeks. Earlier today, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan announced that we will act in concert with like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions on Russia. These measures will certainly come at a cost to us too. But I hope Singaporeans will understand why we need to make a clear stand, even if there is a price to pay, as Minister Balakrishnan has explained.",5,749,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00749
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"One key area we will be significantly impacted by the conflict in Ukraine is energy cost, as we import most of our energy needs. We have already seen in recent months a spike in the global prices of oil and natural gas, which Russia is a major exporter of. For example, liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices have doubled from about $17 dollars per one million British Thermal Units (MMBTU), around half a year ago to about $35 currently. The Brent Crude benchmark also surged past US$100 per barrel just a few days ago, compared to US$71 average we saw last year.",6,750,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00750
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),Motorists must therefore expect pump prices for petrol and diesel here to rise in time. Electricity rates for both businesses and households will also increase in tandem with escalating global energy costs. These will undoubtedly impact Singaporeans and further raise the cost of living here.,7,751,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00751
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The crisis will also further strain global supply chains as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities such as wheat and metals like nickel and palladium. Supply disruptions for these commodities will raise the prices of goods that use these commodities as intermediate input. For example, a global disruption in the supply of nickel could affect the production of stainless steel used in manufacturing and construction sectors. Disruptions to palladium supply will affect the semiconductor industry and consequently, the wider technology goods market. We are working with our key companies to review their business continuity plans to minimise disruptions to their business operations.",8,752,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00752
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),We must also be prepared for the follow-on impact on trade and investment flows. A protracted conflict will affect business confidence and weigh on global economies and impact their recovery from the pandemic.,9,753,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00753
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"So, what does this mean for Singapore's economy? We earlier projected our GDP would grow by 3% to 5% this year with CPI all items inflation ranging between 2.4% and 3.5% and the MAS core inflation between 2% and 3%.",10,754,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00754
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The Ukraine crisis has clouded our economic outlook. The actual impact on Singapore's GDP growth and inflation is difficult to estimate at this stage, given significant uncertainties. A lot will depend on how the conflict unfolds, the global response to the situation, and the longer-term impact on the global economy. However, what is clear is that inflationary pressures are likely to rise further in the near-term, especially through an increase in the prices of oil-related items in the first instance. The downside risks to our economy have also increased significantly.",11,755,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00755
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Some may ask, can we shield Singapore from the impact of these external factors? As an open economy, we will not be able to totally insulate Singapore from the impact of higher global costs. Some ask whether we can help businesses and households. The Small Business Recovery Grant (SBRG) and the Household Support Package (HSP) we announced at the Budget will help our businesses and households, and I will talk about them shortly. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if necessary, introduce additional measures to help them cope with the challenges.",12,756,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00756
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Businesses are understandably concerned. After two years of the pandemic, many have been looking forward to ride the wave of a strong recovery in the global economy this year. The conflict has added considerable volatility and stress on what is an already challenging business environment arising from supply chain disruptions, higher electricity and fuel prices, and a tight labour market. Households have been similarly affected by these inflationary pressures.",13,757,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00757
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The Government understands the strains that businesses and households are under and we will do our best to help them. We have put in place a multi-prong strategy to do so. First, we will work with industries and firms to keep Singapore's economy competitive so that it can continue to sustain real wage growth for Singaporeans.",14,758,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00758
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Despite inflation having gone up, the real median income of full-time employed residents for 2021 grew by close to 1% in a COVID-19 year. The growth was significantly higher at 4.4% for lower-income residents at the lowest 20th percentile.",15,759,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00759
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Second, MAS on 25 January this year, raised the rate of appreciation of the trade-weighted Singapore dollar. A stronger Singapore dollar will help moderate impact of external cost pressures.",16,760,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00760
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Third, the Government works with a wide range of stakeholders to carefully manage the various cost drivers. In January this year, Minister of State Low Yen Ling shared with Members in detail, our measures to address inflationary pressures. These include carefully managing the supply of industrial and commercial space to help manage rental costs, working closely with industry partners to ensure that the prices of daily necessities are competitive and affordable, including diversifying food import sources to reduce our vulnerability to global price fluctuations and working with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) to promote price transparency and help consumers make informed decisions.",17,761,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00761
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Some Members expressed concerns about electricity prices. As Second Minister Tan See Leng explained to the House last year and recently in February this year, MTI and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) have put in place several measures to enhance our energy security and resilience and moderate the volatility in electricity prices. These include ensuring that the electricity gencos have sufficient fuel reserves, establishing a standby fuel facility which gencos can tap on to produce electricity and introducing the Temporary Retail Electricity Contracting Support, or TRECS Scheme. We have already extended TRECS from March to May and will extend it further if necessary. We are also working with gencos and electricity retailers to offer more supplies under such contracts.",18,762,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00762

2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Members also spoke about the challenges that businesses faced in labour shortage and rising manpower costs. I am heartened that Members appreciate the difficult balance we need to achieve between ensuring sufficient manpower for our enterprises and uplifting the capabilities and employment outcomes of our domestic workforce, especially our lower-income workers. Singapore will continue to build a conducive environment for enterprises to grow, our economy to remain open and competitive, and for our workers to benefit from the growth. Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng will share more on what the Government is doing to help firms, especially the SMEs, manage the impact of our manpower policy changes.",20,764,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00764
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The Minister for Finance had also announced a suite of measures in his Budget speech to support businesses, especially SMEs to cope with higher costs. The Small Business Recovery Grant (SBRG) of $1,000 per local employee up to a cap of $10,000 per firm will help eligible firms in sectors most badly affected by COVID-19. The extension of enhanced Enterprise Loan Schemes will facilitate SMEs continued access to financing and ease their cashflow. The enhanced SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit, or SFEC, will now be available to more small and microenterprises and the enhancement of the Productivity Solutions Grant will provide support for a broader range of solutions. Together, more firms will be able to tap on Government support to improve their efficiency and reduce their reliance on manpower. To encourage take-up, the Government will intensify our outreach to SMEs by proactively reaching out to them through the trade associations and chambers, as well as through Enterprise Singapore.",21,765,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00765
2022-02-28-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Households have also been affected by the rise in inflation, especially from higher utilities and grocery bills. The Government will continue to lean forward and help them manage the higher cost of living.

To achieve that, I would like to highlight two areas which we will need to focus on  one, supporting and accelerating our SMEs in their recovery and growth in the new economy; and two, redoubling our efforts to tackle escalating crime trends, specifically to safeguard our citizens against digital crimes such as scams as well as to protect our youths from the perils of drug abuse.",4,781,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00781
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I will first speak on supporting our SMEs which are the backbone of our economy. Although Singapore's economy is projected to grow 3% to 5% in 2022, businesses are cautiously optimistic as the world opens up. Headwinds remain. SMEs expect higher business costs for macro-economic risks, such as rising energy and commodity prices, worsening geopolitical conflicts and supply chains disruptions.",5,782,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00782
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Locally, the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) and tighter foreign labour policies instituted will help uplift lower-wage workers and boost the hiring of residents respectively, but they translate to even greater expenses for our SMEs.",6,783,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00783
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I, therefore, welcome the $500 million Jobs and Business Support Package. This provides payouts to SMEs most affected by COVID-19 restrictions on top of the extension of other financing schemes.",7,784,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00784
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Budget 2022 is clear in its push for SMEs to strengthen its capabilities  $200 million for digitisation schemes, $600 million to expand the Productivity Solutions Grant and $100 million to company skills training.",8,785,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00785
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"All in, support for SMEs to transform and thrive in the new economy is sizeable. Nevertheless, what may weigh on the minds of SME owners are the certainty of cost increases against the uncertain benefits of transformation. Therefore, beyond funding, what is key to realise our plans for a new economy is good execution. The Government can consider more active role to engage and transform our SMEs quicker.",9,786,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00786
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Mr Jimmy Goh, owner of an SME500 awardee, Sim Chwee Mini-mart, recently told me how grateful he was for the support provided by the Productivity Solutions Grant and advice from an SME Centre. This helped him to take the bold step to successfully digitised his father's traditional seafood trading business of over 30 years. While the digitalisation journey was rewarding, he shared the uncertainties that could deter SMEs, such as the heavy reliance on outsourced solution providers and, therefore, the worry of the loss of control of key business data and IT systems.",10,787,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00787
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Another feedback provided to me by the Association of Trade and Commerce noted that SMEs amidst the journey are unclear of the road map to digitalise, such as the need for online marketing after developing a sales website. SMEs found themselves underestimating the cost and time required to build new digital channels.",11,788,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00788
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"As we speak about a greener future, what has hogged the media and public conversations has been above the line carbon tax increases. Looking forward, the focus for SMEs should really be about how to remain competitive and in fact capture more opportunities that are ahead. Increasingly, MNCs and governments will require SMEs to be ESG-compliant to continue to be on their panel of tenders. These standards are not easy to implement and sometimes confusing so it is no wonder that many SMEs do not quite know where to start and how to measure and report compliance.",12,789,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00789
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"While there are different resources available to help businesses in our pursuit of a digital and green economy, SMEs still see transformation as a cost rather than a strategic investment or advantage. This is where the challenge is not about funding alone, but it is about how our Government can play a bigger role in actively engaging our SMEs. More can be done to spark a mindset shift in SMEs, to marshal them towards the right resources, shape role models in different industries and to sustain partnerships in their transformation journey.",13,790,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00790
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"One angle is for the Government to rope in trade associations and chambers of commerce, or TACs, to contribute more as an effective bridge between our agencies and SMEs. So, I am glad Minister Gan just raised this point earlier and I hope to hear more details on this at the coming Committee of Supply debate. If we do this right, SMEs can really benefit and be ahead of the curve against regional competitors in the new economy.",14,791,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00791
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Sir, as important as the Budget is focused on economic progress, is the strengthening of our social resilience. This includes keeping our country safe and secure. I note that Budget 2022 has provided for modest 1.8% increase in MHA's plan expenditure. I hope that it has catered for the expending resources and capabilities to deal with evolving crime trends. At last year's Budget debate, I called for more action and resources to curb the rise of scams.",15,792,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00792

While physical crimes have plunged, scams quadrupled from 2017 and victims lost over $633 billion last year. This is more than the $500 million jobs in the Business Support Package or the $560 million Households Support Package (HSP) to help our young and old. As we battle scams, it is not difficult to worry that more sophisticated cybercrimes that have emerged in other countries, such as ransomware where perpetuators steal monies and our data can also impact us.",16,793,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00793
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Given the above, we need to dedicate more resources, both skilled staff and capabilities, to Singapore Police Force (SPF) to build on the initial success of the Anti-Scam Centre and leverage its partnerships with other stakeholders in the digital ecosystem. We need more public engagement with both individuals, as well as businesses. Everyone has a role to play in this multi-layered strategy.",17,794,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00794
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"An equally worrying trend is that of drug abuse by youths. We owe much thanks to CNB's effectiveness in seizing illicit drugs and apprehending offenders, particularly traffickers, to keep our community safe. Notwithstanding this, youths aged 30 continue to form about 60% of new abusers in recent years. This could be due to the more liberal attitudes they have towards drugs and the advent of new psychoactive substances could make this trend worse.",18,795,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00795
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"We know that along with drug addiction come many social ills. We cannot allow the lives of youths, who are our future, to be marred by drugs. Therefore, more could be done in a concerted effort to engage youths and teachers at schools, as well as parents at home to deal with at-risk youths for timely intervention. There is no silver bullet to solve these challenges. We have to act swiftly and resolutely to protect our citizens.",19,796,2022-02-28-T-012-S-00796
2022-02-28-T-012,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In conclusion, Sir, I am optimistic that the Budget is poised to pivot Singapore as we move towards a post-pandemic world.

Employers understand their critical role in strengthening our social compact and the need for them to build business resilience through fair and progressive employment practices. The transitional wage support, along with support grants and schemes to upskill workers and raise firm level productivity will enable employers to sustain these wage increases. Speaking with other employers, these support measures give us confidence that the Government is with us as we uplift our workforce wages.",2,868,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00868

As observed from Budget 2022, the Government aims to instil labour market resilience through two broad strategies. Firstly, to ensure that Singaporeans who are willing and able to do the jobs, will get good jobs with higher wages and better work prospects. By calibrating the minimum qualifying salary for Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass applicants, employers are strongly encouraged to further consider the quality of foreign workers that they want to bring in and how these workers also strengthen the larger workforce with our Singaporean Core.",5,871,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00871

Job recruitment advertisements for Singaporeans yield low responses. In a recent meeting with a fintech startup, the entrepreneur shared of his difficulty in hiring software engineers. At the same meeting, a business owner in the manufacturing sector lamented that he was unable to hire sufficient staff to fulfil customers' orders. Anecdotes like these are repeated by employers from other industries even when all of them show eagerness to hire Singaporeans.",8,874,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00874

2022-02-28-T-014,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Beyond complementing our local workforce, we need to look at supplementing our workforce. This is especially so for essential services and what I would term also as ""enabling"" services. For example, services such as childcare and infant care enables young parents to dedicate themselves to their jobs, thereby enabling them to be economically active. As we recognise and emphasise the importance of our mental health, there will be a growing need for counsellors in our schools, workplaces and in our communities.

We need to address these concerns as such perceptions have grave consequences for Singapore. As shared, our workforce is ageing, our labour force growth is declining and we would not have enough workers. For Singapore to stay relevant in this fast-changing world, we need access to the best talent and have them be part of our team. Domestically, we need essential and enabling workers to support Singaporeans' aspirations and care for our seniors and children.",15,881,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00881
2022-02-28-T-014,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),This need for Singapore to remain open has to be felt both economically and socially to build labour resilience. Singapore has always been a talent capital and being welcoming to different nationalities and races to call Singapore their new home is essential for our continuous development. Marriage data shows that we have also more Singaporeans marrying foreigners and this trend is likely to continue. All of this makes social integration and acceptance absolutely important. This acceptance of differences is occurring at all levels of our society – from preschools where I have seen children who are not yet attuned to our local languages to workplaces where respect for religious beliefs in food and practices require more sophisticated HR practices.,16,882,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00882

During this transitional period, businesses face a shortage of ""plug and play"" labour to meet their business needs, compounded by labour shortages and the scarcity of tech talent in Singapore. As a result, even if companies are open to adopting new technologies, there is still apprehension and resistance to operationalising such solutions because of the inability to seize revenue opportunities in the short run.",19,885,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00885
2022-02-28-T-014,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Inevitably, businesses will eventually reach a tipping point for technology adoption. The COVID-19 crisis was such one crucial tipping point of historical magnitude. However, the purpose of cultivating labour market resilience is to ensure that businesses can ride on the waves of digitisation instead of being submerged under them. At present, operational and structural challenges are impeding businesses from actualising a resilient labour force. I acknowledge that a radical mindset shift on the part of businesses is needed to respond to larger global trends. However, I would like to ask the Government, what else can be done to address the short-term challenges that businesses face in building a resilient labour force? And what other measures can be put in place to guide businesses as they re-envision their business transformation roadmaps? With a clear labour shortage on our shores, what is the bigger strategy for our workforce composition that will enable us to remain competitive?",20,886,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00886

The floods that resulted from torrential rain in many states of Malaysia last December exposed the reality of extreme weather patterns caused by climate change. Hence, there is a need to strengthen our climate resilience through infrastructural interventions.

In relation to these new sources of funding, I would like to ask the Government to provide more details on the infrastructural projects that have been earmarked for development and specifically the opportunities for our local businesses to be involved in these developments so that they can build necessary capabilities.

2022-02-28-T-014,Cheng Hsing Yao,Mr Cheng Hsing Yao (Nominated Member),"Firstly, the growth and demand for talents will be extremely uneven across business sectors and companies. Even as some experience huge labour shortage, there will still be a significant number of people who are unemployed or under-employed. As businesses are being disrupted at a faster pace, so will the rate of displacement of jobs and skills. I expect the pace at which people will find their skills and knowledge getting outdated to increase going forward. For traditional sectors that we want to transform to raise productivity, the more successful we are with the transformation, the more people will be displaced by new machines and talents. When crafting our policies, we should separate the needs for growth, from the need to care for the displaced workforce, so that we do not unnecessarily limit our growth potential.",9,901,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00901

The ability to use international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of taxable emissions will support the development of a regulated carbon market in Singapore and the region. I would also like to suggest that Singapore incorporate and consider regulating the use of International Renewable Energy Certificates, also known as IRECs, as an alternative means to carbon credits for corporate compliance in taxable emissions.

2022-02-28-T-014,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"Sixth, we must strengthen Singapore's skills and competencies by maintaining a strong supply of skilled workers, provide continued training and skills acquisition throughout their careers, build up alternate entry pathways for those who are doing mid-career switches and recognise the transferability of skills. This will provide the required opportunities for Singaporeans to remain agile and productive longer. It must also be recognised that present and future challenges are complex and multidisciplinary, which would require a team with diverse skills and expertise. We must stretch the potential Singaporeans to enable them over their lifetime on their own time to achieve the highest education and skills potential. It can be a diploma, it can be a degree, Masters or PhD or any other professional certifications, working experience that builds upon skillsets.",28,958,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00958

We must also be mindful not to be overly concerned with degrees and diplomas as we are all reminded by the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sean Parker and Mark Darcy. None of them had University degrees, but a good combination of connective, interpersonal, self leadership and digital skills that set them apart from the rest. This opens possibilities across education, experience, skill archetypes, everyone that has a role to play. Most importantly, as we embark on this journey, we leave no one behind.

With core inflation having risen to 2.1% in December 2021, and with the impending hike of the GST, it is only natural that the cost of living continues to bear on the minds of our people. While I am thankful that the Government uses tax rebates, cash payouts and other forms of aid to cushion the impact of the GST hike for a large majority of Singaporeans, particularly the low-income group, I would like to raise the following for consideration towards a multi-prong approach to address the rising cost of living on the longer-term horizon.",4,969,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00969

Due credit is to be given to Enterprise Singapore for its efforts in helping local enterprises internationalise and assisting the startups.

The ""30 by 30"" plan today outlined the focus on the supply of 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030, but it does not include how we are looking at the food volume supply. In expanding the food supplies, we need to look beyond just basic procurement of supplies. Instead, help local enterprises to scale with partnership models in Southeast Asia or countries where there are swathes of land for agriculture, but they require technology to increase the yield.

However, beyond that, what can be done to provide supplemental pathways to enable our workers to have additional income streams beyond their day job? In picking up freelance roles, it will also allow flexibility in learning new skills, augment their savings and buffer the slack in the workforce. For this, I do not mean those in the gig economy that are doing some of the freelance work about deliveries and those where we think more in the blue collar, but really more those in the professional sense, because age will not become a barrier for these individuals and professionals who choose to continue working in the gig economy after the official retirement age.",15,980,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00980

While it is not uncommon for senior executives to take on advisory roles during retirement, could this practice be expanded to a greater portion of the workforce? From the expat returnees guiding local enterprises that are looking for internationalisation opportunities or for them to mentor companies by domain expertise or their area of interest, their wealth of experience and network will benefit the ecosystem. This would involve a whole-of-society approach and a change in mindset as to how they perceive their golden years to be.

The way to more holistically manage this issue sustainably, in my opinion, is for us to adopt a whole-of-Government and perhaps even a whole-of-society approach.

I shared my residents' sentiments that the GST hike should only be implemented after the job market stabilises. I am heartened that the Government has listened to ground feedback. It has not only delayed the GST implementation, but has staggered it over two years. This gives more time for the job market and economy to adapt and prepare. I have also previously asked whether additional assistance would be provided on top of the Assurance Package and the GST Voucher (GSTV) scheme. I am pleased that the Government will continue to absorb GST on essentials like healthcare and education. Permanent schemes like the Workfare Income Supplement and the GSTV schemes are also enhanced.

Instead, we should challenge ourselves and think hard about what we should spend less on. This is quite a contrarian view, as the Budget is a time when we discuss how Government will increase spending in various areas. The hard truth is that while it is good to have everything, our resources are finite. We should reduce non-essential, duplicative and non-strategic initiatives.",6,995,2022-02-28-T-014-S-00995

The common mentality is that having surpluses would imply that the department did not work hard enough and need to find new areas to work on. We need to stop linking expenditure with KPIs. Ministries should not feel guilty about having excess money to return to the coffers. In fact, the Government should throw a grand challenge – create an award and recognise Ministries that best reduce their expenditure, streamline their operations and cut out non-essential projects.

From my conversations with my residents, care navigation in Singapore has room for improvement. Today, Government agencies like MOH and MSF often focus on policy and administrative matters and devolve the actual provision of care to various social service agencies, or SSAs. Yet, some of these organisations have limited resources.

We need a simple platform that integrates all available resources and service providers, for caregivers to seek out all the available options and do their own cost-benefit analysis. Ultimately, we need an integrated care system that works on the ground. This means better sharing of information, care plans, resources, networks and financial support schemes.

He did not feel safe leaving his parents in the care of a foreign domestic worker, who may neither have the professional experience nor temperament to care for the elderly with special needs. He does not regret the decision, but it is no doubt a setback for his career. Most of us would agree that caregivers like Mr K should be applauded for prioritising family over career.

2022-02-28-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"We must push for higher standards of palliative care. Only four in 10 of healthcare professionals received training in palliative care, according to a 2021 survey. Consequently, most healthcare professionals did not feel prepared to give palliative care. The Singapore Hospice Council is doing good work and they are developing a training framework on palliative care. Will the Government provide more resources and funding to support this effort? How will the Government take the lead to improve the quality of palliative care and to generate more awareness in Singapore?",18,1007,2022-02-28-T-014-S-01007

2022-02-28-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"To be prudent, we should reflect on what we can spend less on – cut waste, reduce redundancies and for the Government to coordinate better.

2022-02-28-T-017,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Education in light of reports by health experts which find that physical development markers such as the Body Mass Index (BMI) can have a negative impact on a child's mental well-being (a) whether BMI data can be sent to school health services for follow-up instead of being listed in the student's report book; and (b) what is being done in schools to assist students with weight and body image issues.,1,1020,2022-02-28-T-017-S-01020
2022-02-28-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Schools measure the height and weight of students twice a year to monitor their physical development, using Body Mass Index (BMI)-for-Age norms set out by the Health Promotion Board (HPB). Following the measurements, students outside the healthy range for physical growth are supported by the school to focus on healthier behaviours using strategies such as journaling, goal setting and action planning in physical activities and nutrition to bring about gradual improvement in BMI. Severely overweight and severely underweight students are referred to the HPB's Student Health Centre (SHC) for medical assessment and counselling.",1,1021,2022-02-28-T-017-S-01021
2022-02-28-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Schools recognise the importance of working with parents to enhance their child's holistic development and well-being. Hence, schools may reflect many indicators, not just academic indicators, but also conduct, attendance, CCA records, physical fitness test results and BMI weight indicator in the Holistic Development Profile report to inform students, update and seek their parents' support in reinforcing the holistic development of their children at home.",2,1022,2022-02-28-T-017-S-01022
2022-02-28-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our schools adopt a holistic health promotion approach to improve the overall well-being of students, and to encourage them to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Through physical education lessons, students are taught good health habits such as healthy eating, and regular participation in sports and exercise to lead an active lifestyle.",3,1023,2022-02-28-T-017-S-01023
2022-02-28-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum equips students with age-appropriate knowledge and skills to help them build positive body image and healthy self-esteem. Students learn to appreciate their strengths and understand the developmental changes that they experience as they grow. They also learn that their sense of worth does not need to depend on external affirmation, but can be anchored on their understanding of themselves and their intrinsic qualities.",4,1024,2022-02-28-T-017-S-01024
2022-02-28-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) where do migrant workers who are living in dormitories recover when they are infected with COVID-19; (b) what is the current capacity of such facilities or arrangements; and (c) whether there are plans to increase the capacity of such facilities or arrangements.,1,1025,2022-02-28-T-018-S-01025
2022-02-28-T-018,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,MOM has put in place a Dormitory Recovery Programme that mirrors the COVID-19 recovery in the community. Fully vaccinated COVID-19 positive workers who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms recover in dedicated recovery facilities. Migrant workers who are at a higher risk of severe disease are conveyed to appropriate healthcare facilities such as the hospitals for medical care.,1,1026,2022-02-28-T-018-S-01026
2022-02-28-T-018,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We had set up recovery facilities and specifically re-purposed them from dedicated blocks in certain dormitories and segregated from workers who are not infected. COVID-19 positive workers in these recovery facilities monitor their vitals thrice daily and have access to medical services at regional medical centres or 24/7 telemedicine consultations. Mobile clinical teams may also be deployed to further augment medical care, when required.",2,1027,2022-02-28-T-018-S-01027
2022-02-28-T-018,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,We have stood up sufficient recovery beds to accommodate COVID-19 positive migrant workers. We are monitoring the situation closely and are able to add to the capacity of recovery facilities as needed.,3,1028,2022-02-28-T-018-S-01028
2022-02-28-T-019,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee,asked the Prime Minister whether MAS has plans to introduce grants that support banks in developing green and sustainability-linked liabilities frameworks so as to take in green deposits to fund banks' green and sustainability related loans.,1,1029,2022-02-28-T-019-S-01029
2022-02-28-T-019,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Businesses accessing green and sustainability-linked financing generally face higher costs compared to conventional financing. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) therefore provides grants to the businesses to help them defray the additional expenses associated with obtaining an external review on the eligibility of the project being financed, or the monitoring, measurement and reporting of the borrower's progress in meeting the sustainability metrics.",1,1030,2022-02-28-T-019-S-01030
2022-02-28-T-019,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"On the other hand, there is comparatively less friction for banks to offer green deposits or similar products. Indeed, some local financial institutions have introduced green and sustainability-linked deposit products given healthy interest from both corporate and retail segments. These include HSBC Singapore's Green Deposit Account launched in January 2020 for corporate clients to finance green initiatives, and OCBC's sustainability-linked structured deposit for retail investors launched in September 2021. There is currently no market failure or gap that requires MAS to support green deposits with grants, as it currently does for other sustainable and sustainability-linked solutions which face additional costs or other constraints.",2,1031,2022-02-28-T-019-S-01031
2022-02-28-T-020,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether service commitments to feedback from residents can be standardised across the various Government agencies and Statutory Boards for matters requiring a simple response; and (b) where matters are complex or delays expected, whether responses can be designed to provide more transparency and opportunity for direct follow-up so that residents know when they can expect an update.",1,1032,2022-02-28-T-020-S-01032
2022-02-28-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),The Public Service places great importance on public feedback and has a set of whole-of-Government service standards in place to ensure agencies uphold a consistent and satisfactory level of service. Every Ministry and Statutory Board is required to appoint a Quality Service Manager (QSM) of a senior level to ensure that the QSM can provide the necessary leadership and ensure that feedback is adequately and properly reviewed within the agency.,1,1033,2022-02-28-T-020-S-01033
2022-02-28-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"The response time depends on the nature and complexity of the enquiry or the feedback received. For straightforward enquiries and feedback, both Ministries and Statutory Boards are given guidance to resolve and respond within three working days. For complex issues that require further assessment and fact-finding such as making site inspections or coordinating with more than one agency, agencies are given guidance to provide a reply within three weeks. If a solution cannot be provided, agencies should explain why the issue requires further study and be transparent with the plan of action. Agencies are also required to send interim replies if they are unable to respond within the time communicated.",2,1034,2022-02-28-T-020-S-01034
2022-02-28-T-021,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Prime Minister with regard to the reverse mortgage tie up between CPF and DBS to help seniors unlock equity from their private homes while they continue to live in them (a) whether the Government has data on the take-up rates since it was offered; and (b) whether the Government will implement measures to promote reverse mortgages and increase awareness among these seniors who are asset-rich but cash-strapped.,1,1035,2022-02-28-T-021-S-01035
2022-02-28-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),The DBS Home Equity Income Loan is a reverse mortgage product that allows homeowners to borrow against their fully paid private residential properties. The loan proceeds will be used to top up their CPF Retirement Sums which will be used for the CPF LIFE,1,1036,2022-02-28-T-021-S-01036
2022-02-28-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Since its launch in August 2021, we understand DBS has approved most of the reverse mortgage applications it has received from eligible private property owners. We are unable to share specific data on the take-up of the product as the information is commercially sensitive.",2,1037,2022-02-28-T-021-S-01037
2022-02-28-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The Government offers a range of housing monetisation options. All homeowners can consider renting out the property or a room for rental income, or right-sizing. HDB owners who right-size may enjoy a cash bonus through the Silver Housing Bonus scheme. Eligible HDB flat owners can also unlock the value of their properties by selling back part of their lease to HDB under the Lease Buyback Scheme. Homeowners can access information on these housing monetisation options on HDB's website.",3,1038,2022-02-28-T-021-S-01038
2022-02-28-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The Government will continue to review our policies to ensure Singaporeans have suitable housing monetisation options, especially to meet their retirement needs.",4,1039,2022-02-28-T-021-S-01039
2022-02-28-T-022,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Transport in light of the incident where a bus driver was assaulted by intoxicated passengers after being advised by the operations control room to stop the bus and lock its doors (a) whether due consideration was given to the safety of the driver and passengers when the advice was given; (b) whether the Ministry will be looking into enhancing public safety under such scenarios; and (c) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the installation of protective barriers in buses.,1,1040,2022-02-28-T-022-S-01040
2022-02-28-T-022,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Public transport operators (PTOs) have standard operating procedures or SOPs in place to manage incidents that bus captains may face in the course of their duties, including physical or verbal abuse by commuters. The SOPs include de-escalation procedures to be adopted by bus captains. Incidents of physical or verbal abuse are also reported to the respective Bus Operations Control Centres (BOCCs) who will activate the Police where necessary.",1,1041,2022-02-28-T-022-S-01041
2022-02-28-T-022,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Where commuters remain aggressive even after attempts to de-escalate, bus captains will be advised to stop the bus at the next bus stop and wait for the Police's arrival. These procedures were followed for the incident in question, where a Go-Ahead Singapore (GAS) bus captain was assaulted by two intoxicated commuters on 2 November 2021.",2,1042,2022-02-28-T-022-S-01042
2022-02-28-T-022,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Where a commuter could put the safety of the bus captain or other commuters at risk, the BOCC will advise the bus captain to open the bus doors so that the bus captain and commuters can leave the bus if necessary. In the incident cited by the Member, the bus captain was assaulted when he returned to the driver cabin after reminding the two commuters to put on their masks. As the attacks happened suddenly, the BOCC did not have an opportunity to provide further guidance to the bus captain.",3,1043,2022-02-28-T-022-S-01043
2022-02-28-T-022,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The installation of protective barriers in buses was trialled in 2018 and 2020. However, these were discontinued as bus captains had provided feedback that the glare from the barriers posed a safety risk when driving.",4,1044,2022-02-28-T-022-S-01044
2022-02-28-T-022,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"LTA, the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) and the PTOs stand united in adopting a zero-tolerance approach to abuses against public transport workers. Both assailants involved in this incident have been charged in Court. One of them was sentenced to 10 months' jail while Court proceedings for the second assailant are pending. After the conclusion of Court proceedings, we will also assist the bus captain if he wishes to pursue civil legal actions against the assailants. Strong enforcement and tough penalties are necessary to send a clear signal and deter abuses against our frontline workers.",5,1045,2022-02-28-T-022-S-01045
2022-02-28-T-023,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the estimated utilisation rates of unsheltered bicycle parking racks at or near transport facilities; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider building shelters for existing bicycle parking facilities to increase usage by commuters.,1,1046,2022-02-28-T-023-S-01046
2022-02-28-T-023,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The average utilisation rate of the approximately 27,000 bicycle parking lots at key transport nodes was around 60% last year. For unsheltered lots, the utilisation rate is around 55%. These bicycle parking lots can be found at MRT and LRT stations, bus interchanges and Integrated Transport Hubs. They are provided free-of-charge to support active mobility and first-mile, last-mile connectivity.",1,1047,2022-02-28-T-023-S-01047

Safeguards have been put in place to mitigate the risk of transmission including vaccination, a regime of frequent testing, donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) and safe management measures (SMMs). Aviation companies, including Changi Airport Group (CAG) and SATS, have developed business continuity plans (BCPs) in the event of staff absenteeism due to COVID-19.",1,1050,2022-02-28-T-024-S-01050
2022-02-28-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"SATS has clarified that one of the reasons for the recent disruption at its facility at the Changi Airfreight Centre was a sudden spike in COVID-19 infections among its cargo coordinators who are specialists responsible for checking and breaking down cargo pallets at the Import Terminal. This occurred amidst a surge in cargo volume in the lead up to Chinese New Year, which was about 20% higher compared to last year. This resulted in a backlog of unprocessed cargo and delays in shipments for collection by the cargo agents and disrupted the smooth flow of goods in and out of Singapore.",2,1051,2022-02-28-T-024-S-01051
2022-02-28-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"According to SATS almost all the cargo received between 26 January and 3 February has either been collected by the cargo agents or is ready for collection.

A number of families we surveyed mentioned that they had to care for family members, including young children. For these families, caregiving support could enable them to find work or take up full-time jobs. However, the number of families who need caregiving support varies across ComLink towns and it is also not clear that night-time childcare is the preferred model across the board.",1,1055,2022-02-28-T-025-S-01055

NParks has a licensing framework in place to safeguard the health and welfare of animals at pet breeders and pet shops. In October 2021, NParks announced tightened licensing conditions for pet breeders to raise industry standards and improve the health and welfare of animals. To ensure traceability and compliance with licensing conditions, NParks conducts regular inspections on licensed pet breeders and pet shops. NParks also investigates reports of unlicensed pet breeding and sales, and also takes enforcement action against the offenders.",2,1062,2022-02-28-T-027-S-01062
