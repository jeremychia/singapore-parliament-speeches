2022-03-02-T-001,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether there are plans to complement commercial supply of antigen rapid test (ART) kits from overseas suppliers with the increase in manufacturing capacity of locally produced ART kits.,1,1,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00001
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, MOH has received applications from six ART companies which are in various stages of evaluation by MOH and Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The applicants indicated that the kits will be manufactured or assembled locally. Once approved, the companies will be able to apply for existing grant and loan schemes that MTI and its Statutory Boards provide to support companies with their plans for local manufacturing.",1,2,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00002
2022-03-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.,1,3,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00003
2022-03-02-T-001,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister of State for the response. It is heartening to know that there are six companies that are keen to make or assembly ART kits here. This is very welcome news, indeed. I understand from a recent Straits Times article or report last year that there are, currently, two local manufactured ART kits that are being approved for use within a clinical setting with professional guidance, but they were not able to obtain the necessary validations for approval to sell on the retail market because most local hospitals are too busy to carry out clinical trials of the kits.",1,4,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00004
2022-03-02-T-001,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I have three follow-up supplementary questions. First, will there be any particular consideration that could hold back the approval of these six companies' applications that have been announced? Second, what are the considerations when approving an ART kit for retail sale? Third, what steps are being taken to mitigate the risk posed by connectivity disruptions to ensure a good, steady and healthy supply of ART kits to Singapore? Appreciate the clarifications.",2,5,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00005
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Member Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for his three supplementary questions. Mr Speaker, globally, the demand for ART kits has increased in various countries, including Singapore, as we move towards making testing for COVID-19 part and parcel of our lives and also, in a way, to keep the virus in check. Here, we have seen an increase in the demand for ART kits amidst the latest Omicron wave and also during the recent festive period.",1,6,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00006
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In addition, more Singaporeans are practising social responsibility with regular self-testing. So, to Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's third question on ensuring the connectivity and continuous supply of ART kits, I want to reassure him and everyone in the House that the Government has been able to respond to heightened demand due to our multi-pronged strategy of diversification, stockpiling and also by working very closely with the importers, distributors, retailers to ensure that Singapore and Singaporeans have continual and sufficient supply of ART kits.",2,7,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00007
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Firstly, the Singapore Government keeps a reserve of ART kits to mitigate any sudden surge in demand or disruption of supplies. During the recent spike of Omicron cases, MOH drew down on its stockpile to supplement the retailers' supply of testing kits. Prior to that, Members would probably remember that the Government distributed close to 25 million ART kits to households in Singapore just last year. If Members remember, the two distribution drives – the first was between August and September, and the second drive was between October and December – saw that each household received a total of 16 ART kits. So, I want to assure Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim that the Government spares no effort in ensuring the continued supply of ART kits which is critical to living in the new normal.",3,8,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00008
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Secondly, we diversify our sources of ART kits by importing from multiple sources. Currently, as I indicated in my answer to the Parliamentary Question (PQ), there are no companies locally manufacturing or assembling ART kits that are approved for retail sale yet. So, we welcome the application of the six companies seeking to assemble or manufacture ART kits in Singapore.",4,9,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00009
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To his first two supplementary questions about testing, requirements and approval process required for retail sale, I want to share with Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Members that only ART kits that have been evaluated to meet the stringent standards of quality, safety and performance and, at the same time, verified for its accuracy when used by consumers, will be made available for retail sale.",5,10,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00010
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For example, ART kits have to undergo a separate route for approval where they are being benchmarked against PCR tests. Why is this necessary? Because MOH has explained that these self-test ART kits are to be used widely by members of the public in self-test settings. So, the implications on public health will be huge and significant if the kits that are approved for self-test are not sufficiently accurate.",6,11,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00011
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Besides the 12 self-test ART kits that have been approved by MOH and HSA for retail sales, I want to assure Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim that MOH is also actively evaluating other ART kits for their eligibility. The brands, Alltest and Indicaid, have just obtained the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) approval and will soon be on our retail shelves this month.",7,12,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00012
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,Two other brands called Biocredit and Hotgen have obtained satisfactory analytical validation results and are in the midst of obtaining their PSAR registration prior to clinical validation.,8,13,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00013
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,We hope that we will continue to have more options and wider supplies of ART kits from here as well as from abroad.,9,14,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00014
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Thirdly, we work very closely with various partners, importers, distributors and retailers to plan ahead and ensure that affordable stocks of ART kits are constantly on-stream for Singaporeans.",10,15,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00015
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to assure Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim that MTI, together with MOH and HSA, will continue to make the supply of ART kits our key priority and will provide ample support for the development and expeditious evaluation of ART kits, including local ones, to ensure quality self-test kits for Singapore's protection and safety.",11,16,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00016
2022-03-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.,1,17,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00017
2022-03-02-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I ask the Minister of State will the local manufacture of ART kits be expected to reduce the price of ART kits, which can benefit consumers? I am asking this because the current price of over $5 per kit can still be a cost burden on many families who are all on quarantine or Health Risk Notice (HRN) and are expected to test regularly.",1,18,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00018
2022-03-02-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),I note from personal experience that a number of free ART kits given out at the vending machines to individuals on HRN seem to have been reduced from six to three. Can I confirm that this is the case?,2,19,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00019
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. I mentioned the multi-pronged approach and the third prong that I mentioned is that MTI will continue to work closely with our importers, distributors and retailers to bring in various brands of self-test ART kits and to give choice and options to consumers.",1,20,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00020
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"If Members remember, in the last one year – we now have a wider supply of ART kits and, as of now, MOH and HSA have already approved 12, with more coming on-stream – the price of test kits has since fallen by almost half. Most recently, I went to either Guardian or Watsons, and you can buy an ART kit for about $4.90.",2,21,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00021
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Having said that, I want to assure Mr Gerald Giam that, indeed, price is one of the considerations as part of MOH and HSA's evaluation criteria. And I want to assure Singaporeans that, regardless of financial background, if you remember last week, MOH has announced the setting up of more than 200 Combined Testing Centres (CTCs) and Quick Testing Centres (QTCs), where any COVID-19 patient with mild symptoms can proceed to for supervised self-test ART kits usage. At the same time, members of the public can make appointments at any of the QTCs and CTCs.",3,22,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00022
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"At the same time, MOH and MSF have also distributed about 140,000 kits to low-income households.",4,23,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00023
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"So, I want to assure Mr Gerald Giam and Members in the House that we will press on with our multi-prong approach to ensure that Singaporeans have access to continued supply of ART self-test kits.",5,24,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00024
2022-03-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,25,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00025
2022-03-02-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Just one supplementary question, further to what my colleague Mr Gerald Giam was talking about. I heard one report that a PCR test was actually substantially cheaper in a neighbouring country, compared to Singapore. I am not sure how accurate that is or whether it is still the case. But my supplementary question is, looking at the countries in the region which have large populations, has the Government explored doing bulk purchase agreements, working together with other ASEAN countries, to negotiate with the manufacturers of these test kits, whether PCR or ART, as a way of lowering the price?",1,26,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00026
2022-03-02-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Leon Perera for his supplementary question. I want to assure him that an important part of our multi-prong approach is to diversify our import sources. In fact, we import from various locations, including South Korea, US, Hong Kong and China. So, we will press on with our efforts, not just in terms of importing from multiple sources to bring choice and, in general, to further lower the price of ART kits, but, at the same time, to work with local companies or Singapore-based companies which have the intention or interest to manufacture or assemble ART self-test kits here.",1,27,2022-03-02-T-001-S-00027
2022-03-02-T-002,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Silver Generation Office ambassadors and staff are currently engaged in outreach activities; and (b) in each of the last three years, how many (i) home visits and (ii) telephone check-ins have been conducted.",1,28,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00028
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health),"The Silver Generation Office (SGO) has deployed about 3,000 staff and volunteers as Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs) to proactively reach out to seniors.",1,29,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00029
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health),"Since 2014, SGO has made over one million engagements. In 2019, SGO made 339,000 home visits. In 2020, SGO adapted their engagement approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic and made 140,000 home visits, complemented by an additional 140,000 telephone check-ins.",2,30,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00030
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health),"In 2021, SGO pivoted to encouraging and assisting our seniors’ COVID-19 vaccinations, reaching out to 168,000 and 11,000 seniors through home visits and telephone check-ins respectively.",3,31,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00031
2022-03-02-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Mariam Jaafar.,1,32,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00032
2022-03-02-T-002,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"I think a lot has been raised in this House of the concerns for the mental wellness of our elderly. As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on, it has been quite a while since some of them have had house visits. Can the Ministry also talk about the forward-looking plans? Will we bring the house visits back to the level of about 300,000 and when will that happen?",1,33,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00033
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"I thank the Member for the questions. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in the way SGO reaches out to these seniors. To move forward, we also need to understand the genesis of the SGO. SGO was previously known as the Pioneer Generation Office (PGO) and it was established to reach out to Pioneers relating to the PG package and tell them about the various Government schemes, MediShield and CHAS.",1,34,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00034
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"When it then evolved in April 2019 to merge with AIC, the expanded scope was then to reach out to another bigger group. So, initially, it was a smaller group; and it extended to a bigger group. That was for the Merdeka Generation Package.",2,35,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00035
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"In 2020, SGO then had to adjust and pivot, to shift into doing house visits as well as tele-engagements with the vulnerable group. And this is also something that we need to continue looking at. I understand the concerns because the elderly are at home and they are not able to engage. There are a lot of efforts that we are doing with other partners as well, to make sure that this engagement continues.",3,36,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00036
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We recognise that SGO's mandate is now to go beyond just communicating Government schemes to better address their needs in a more targeted manner. So, SGO has been working with the Regional Health Systems clusters, primary care and community care Partners to instil preventive health messaging in seniors in the community, so that they can also augment the support and engagement that they, through the SGAs, have been giving.",4,37,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00037
2022-03-02-T-002,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We are hoping to continue to build on this relationship, so that we can expand that effort and also look at targeting areas, especially with more frequent visits to at-risk seniors, including those who are frail or have weak social support. We are also enhancing the competency of the SGAs to engage our seniors more effectively, so that they can continue to stay active and mentally engaged as well.",5,38,2022-03-02-T-002-S-00038
2022-03-02-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower when implementing the mandatory rest day for migrant domestic workers at the end of 2022, whether the Ministry intends to define the rest day as a full 24-hour period of uninterrupted rest.",1,39,2022-03-02-T-003-S-00039

2022-03-02-T-003,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, MOM had earlier announced our plan to introduce the policy of requiring employers to provide their migrant domestic workers (MDWs) with at least one rest day a month that cannot be compensated away. This is to provide MDWs with opportunities to rest and recharge from work and to form a network of support outside the household.",1,41,2022-03-02-T-003-S-00041
2022-03-02-T-003,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Manpower),"We do not intend to define the number of hours of uninterrupted rest for MDWs in a given rest day. Different households have different arrangements with their MDWs based on their respective needs. If MOM prescribes a fixed number, it will impose rigidity on both employers and MDWs. What is more important is that the employer and the MDW maintain open communications on their respective needs and come to a mutual agreement on the rest day arrangement.",2,42,2022-03-02-T-003-S-00042
2022-03-02-T-003,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Manpower),"If MDWs and their employers need help to reach an agreement on the rest day arrangement, they may call MOM’s MDW helpline for advice. They may also seek assistance from a neutral third party, such as their employment agencies, or consider utilising the free dispute resolution services offered by the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) to arrive at an amicable solution.",3,43,2022-03-02-T-003-S-00043
2022-03-02-T-003,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Manpower),The rest day policy will be implemented towards the end of 2022. This is to give existing employers and their MDWs time to adjust to the new policy.,4,44,2022-03-02-T-003-S-00044

2022-03-02-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir, I thank the Minister of State for the reply. Could I just ask how MOM will be monitoring and enforcing this mandatory rest day rule? Also, what action will be taken against employers who do not give their foreign domestic workers this mandatory rest day?",1,46,2022-03-02-T-003-S-00046
2022-03-02-T-003,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"MOM will be communicating to the employment agencies as well as to the employers on the requirement for this mandatory rest day policy.

2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Speaker, veterinarians are licensed and regulated by the Animal and Veterinary Service, or AVS, for short. As part of the licensing conditions, veterinarians are required to comply with the Code of Ethics for Veterinarians, which sets out the expected professional standards of conduct. Veterinarians who fail to adhere to the rules of conduct may be subject to professional discipline, including written warnings, composition fines and even suspension or revocation of their licences.",1,53,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00053
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Over the last three years, AVS received a total of 65 veterinary complaints, comprising 15 cases in 2019, 25 cases in 2020 and 25 cases in 2021. Of these cases, 10 veterinarians were issued warnings and one was issued a compound fine. None was suspended or had his/her licence revoked.",2,54,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00054
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"AVS investigates complaints on professional misconduct or negligence. Investigations can take up to 12 months or longer, as AVS needs time to gather the evidence, including detailed medical records and accounts from all parties, to make a thorough assessment. In complex cases, AVS will seek inputs from veterinary practitioners with the relevant experience and expertise. Such veterinary complaints may be presented to the Complaint Evaluation Committee, or CEC, for short, for further assessment. The Committee appointed by AVS comprises AVS veterinarians, practising veterinarians and non-affiliated legal professionals to ensure that the complaints are evaluated robustly.",3,55,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00055
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"AVS is working with the Singapore Veterinary Association to raise professional standards of the veterinary sector.

2022-03-02-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I thank the Minister of State for his answer. Just two supplementary questions.,1,58,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00058
2022-03-02-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The first is on the timeframe. Currently, the investigations can take a year or more. I think, recently, the regime for handling disciplinary issues for doctors for human beings was also revamped and overhauled, partly with the view to reducing the time that issue is hanging over the head of the veterinarian. So, is the Ministry considering ways to reduce that time taken for the investigation?",2,59,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00059
2022-03-02-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, in terms of what the Minister of State said on reviewing the structure of regulation and considering a professional or elected body, that is good news. Is there a timeframe when this review is targeted to be completed, roughly?",3,60,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00060
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. On the first question about timeframe, indeed, this is something that we are very mindful of for any investigation where the complainant and the accused are being looked into. As I have mentioned earlier, NParks – or AVS in specifics, a part of NParks – looks into the investigations for a thorough evaluation. We have to interview all the parties concerned; we have to look at thorough medical records.",1,61,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00061
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"And for animals, which, in a way, perhaps unlike for human beings, we need to bring in the relevant veterinary practitioners with expertise. For example, if the animal is a frog, rabbit, hamster, dog or cat, we may require different expertise to join the panel – the Complaint Evaluation Committee – to look into this matter. And this is something that we are mindful of, in making sure that the process is robust, objective and thorough.",2,62,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00062
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"I take Mr Leon Perera's point about whether we could look into shortening the process. This is something that we have to discuss with our stakeholders in the veterinary sector, as well as the different users of the vet services. And we certainly look at this as part of the overall review that we are doing.",3,63,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00063
2022-03-02-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"On the second question around the setting up of the professional body or entity that was mentioned in my reply, allow me to contextualise it to the Member. This is part of the overall broader pet sector review, which I spoke about also in response to the Member's question yesterday. We are looking at raising standards of professionalism across the entire pet sector, from boarders, breeders, to animal welfare groups, veterinarians, trainers, to individual users; and we are doing so collectively. The intent is to bring different stakeholders together to understand the issues and one another's perspectives and come to a common consensus on how we are to move together, with the welfare of the pet at the centre of what we do.",4,64,2022-03-02-T-004-S-00064

2022-03-02-T-006,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"With COVID-19, the mental health of care workers, caregivers – and I shall refer to them as ""carers"" – has deteriorated significantly in the past two years.

Such statistics point to an increased risk of burnout amidst a lengthy pandemic and, in the longer term, of an increasingly unattractive care sector. It is not surprising that 1,500 medical workers resigned in the first half of 2021, when many of them worked too long hours, with inadequate manpower and support.",3,85,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00085
2022-03-02-T-006,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Burnout occurs when people feel overburdened and depleted of emotional and physical energy. Some effects of burnout include loss of motivation, negativity, a sense of failure, self-doubt and a cynical attitude towards others, as well as a loss of empathy. Empathy is the bedrock of caring professions and it runs short when people feel burnt out.",4,86,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00086

We also need adequate recognition through reasonable compensation and opportunities for advancement to boost morale and motivation and ensure that the care industry remains sustainable in the long term. Most people who chose the care professions are motivated by a strong desire to care for others and very few are calculative about monetary contributions and compensation. However, we should still take good care of them and ensure that they have the means to sustain themselves.",7,89,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00089

2022-03-02-T-006,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),Enhancing HCG will go a long way to lighten their load because finances have shown to be the most significant source of stress for informal caregivers. I suggest that we tier the HCG according to the care recipient's needs and associated expenses. Care recipients who require assistance with more activities of daily living (ADLs) can and should be supported with higher amounts of HCG.,11,93,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00093

Often, the family members who are not personally involved in care work fail to understand how demanding it is.

I have spoken about this before in Parliament and I caution again about putting dual responsibility on teachers to double up as counsellors amidst an already overwhelming workload.

Dr Chen is a medical doctor trained in internal medicine and who has special interests in dementia and intellectual disability (ID). When she was in Junior College, she had the opportunity to volunteer at MINDS, to provide support to individuals with ID. She shared candidly that, in the beginning, the experience was daunting and, after her first session, she was not certain if she would do it again. Despite her reservations, she continued to help out at MINDS over the years.",3,120,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00120
2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"After graduating from medical school and becoming a doctor, she volunteered in her free time to give medical care to patients with ID. This is challenging because, typically, patients with ID also have multiple medical issues. Aside from that, what Dr Chen came to realise was that it was also necessary to track the health and well-being of their parents and caregivers. Patients with ID depend on their caregivers for many things, including, but not limited to, compliance with medication, nutrition and therapies. Their health, largely, depends on the ability of their caregivers to manage their care. This means that the health and well-being of the caregivers also needed to be addressed, especially as they age. Dr Chen, therefore, developed a holistic healthcare approach for ageing caregivers and their adult children with ID, addressing also social issues and bringing together multidisciplinary stakeholders on the same platform. This is a fairly niche area relating to healthcare and, although seemingly illogical, it is a refreshing and efficient approach to the issue. Only someone in the sector and familiar with working with such families would appreciate the specific challenges they face and curate the appropriate solutions.",4,121,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00121

We have heard, in recent times, the call to provide more support for families with children with special needs. I will touch more on this in my speeches for the COS debate. I am happy that the Government has responded to this call. In particular, Minister Chan Chun Sing’s and Minister Masagos Zulkifli’s replies to recent Parliamentary Questions gave assurance that the Government will continue to strengthen efforts and will work with the community to provide this support and build an inclusive society.",5,122,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00122

She has been working with Government agencies to see how this effort can be made accessible to more in Singapore. As a parent of a child with ID, I am heartened and glad that there are people like Dr Chen, who looks out for the needs of those with special needs and their caregivers. They do not only volunteer their time but seek to find solutions to make things better for others, especially for those who are vulnerable. Dr Chen shows how it is so important to walk the talk. She does not just give comments and expect the Government to come up with the solutions, but she has come up with substantive and constructive plans, tirelessly working with partners and taking effort to implement the ideas.",6,123,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00123

Mr Hafiz was a consultant, and Kinobi initially started as a movement during COVID-19 to help prepare students for the working world. Mr Hafiz and his friends-turned-partners started conducting webinars on career role models and tips on how to get into different industries. They saw great success for a few months in a row. There would be an average of about 200 to 300 participants at each of these webinars, which they initially held for young people in Singapore but, subsequently, also organised for youths in the region.

2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I believe this is also an area that the Government is keenly aware of. In the past year, career uncertainty has remained a top concern among two in five job-seeking youths, based on NYC’s youth sentiment polls, February to December 2021. The pandemic has reshaped the economy, made some sectors less desirable but also created new opportunities. Those who were about to enter the workforce had to adjust, like everyone else, and prepare for this new world. For several years, even before the pandemic, the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) had developed their career guidance framework. When the pandemic hit, these services needed to be strengthened and updated to address current needs. There were efforts by NYC and Young NTUC to provide resources for the youths to learn about growth sectors and how to prepare themselves for the working world.",8,125,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00125
2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"For example, the YouthTech Programme launched by NYC for youths to gain work insights in the increasingly important area of technology and digitalisation, creates pathways for young people to learn new skills and gain tangible experiences. Another example is the career symposium entitled LIT DISCOvery organised by Young NTUC as part of the SkillsFuture month in July last year. There were online webinars, workshops as well as virtual mentoring and masterclasses to equip youths and young working adults with the necessary technology and soft skills to pivot into new and evolving job roles in the growth sectors.",9,126,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00126
2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I think the provision of support for our youths remains acute and necessary. Aside from career guidance, mentoring should also be an area that the Government continues to develop.",10,127,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00127
2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In fact, Mr Hafiz, whom I was speaking about, is, himself, a champion of mentoring. He is the co-Chairman of the Mentoring AfA and also oversees Mara Mentoring, one of the M3 programmes, which aims to accelerate the career and personal progression of high-potential Malay/Muslim undergraduates, by connecting them to a dedicated community of successful early career professionals.",11,128,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00128
2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Mr Hafiz has also managed to turn his passion into a business opportunity. What started as a series of webinars during COVID-19 has, today, become a business set-up, with 51 university partners across Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines using its services. Kinobi provides free career tools and services for all students, such as resume-builder and job preparation courses, augmented with a job portal. Kinobi sees itself as the technology partner for university career services, driving a systemic change. They create, replace and augment the institution’s career platforms, enabling career services staff to do more to serve their student population.",12,129,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00129

The SG StartUp Grant was a great catalyst in helping his team to do this full-time. They also had guidance from Enterprise SG as well as the Singapore Business Federation in getting them plugged into the regional ecosystem. His alma mater, SMU, has supported them via their incubator, by connecting them to the alumni based in Indonesia and by partnering with Kinobi across initiatives like SMU Fintech Symposium.",13,130,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00130

2022-03-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, it is important that the Government builds on efforts to support young individuals to explore career opportunities. There is value in enhancing the resolution of this support through developing the framework for mentoring. Many of us have had the good fortune of meeting someone in our lives who has guided us, shown us what is possible and brought us to a completely different trajectory in our lives. Not everyone, or every young person, is as fortunate. We should build an ecosystem of support, a culture of mentoring, so that every young person, regardless of his or her background, has the chance to be guided to find and seize all the opportunities that come their way.",17,134,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00134

A Budget channels funds, creates opportunities and empowers individuals. However, it is not the be-all and end-all and should not be so.

The monies set aside for the assistance packages are substantial. Though these can offset the GST increases for up to 10 years for the lowest income group, we should continue to look out for those among us who need more support.",1,144,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00144

Every day, when people have to pay the extra 20 cents or 30 cents more for their beverages and 50 cents more for their food, they feel squeezed. The elderly and retired feel such financial pressures especially keenly. So, that adds an additional layer of stress and anxiety to their lives.",2,145,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00145

Yes, they do receive assistance but, understandably, it will be less than HDB dwellers. I urge MOF to consider highlighting the various payouts to all residents in both public and private housing estates through a letter or email to them or a mode of communication that they are comfortable with. Though this might alleviate some stress, I would still appeal for more consideration of some cases, as they do have genuine circumstances that do warrant more support.",4,147,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00147

2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In fact, the Government's ""kueh lapis"" approach of multiple lines of assistance may, in fact, levy an unnecessary bandwidth tax on the poor when they seek help. ""Bandwidth tax"" refers to the additional cognitive burden they face. To get support from multiple schemes, they personally have to fill up paperwork, produce documents, attend meetings and meet deadlines. And because they struggle, their cognitive functioning is impacted and they may make what many others see as ""poor"" decisions. As a result, they become entangled even more deeply in the poverty cycle. One study found that the bandwidth tax due to poverty can be the equivalent of 13 to 14 IQ points.",25,225,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00225

2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, we should increase the accessibility of state schemes. I will suggest four ways to do this.",28,228,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00228
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The first involves us currently having too many financial assistance schemes that confuse and overwhelm their applicants. These include CDC vouchers of various kinds, ComCare and the Pioneer Disability Fund, for example. We should aim instead to minimise the number of scheme distributors and not have applicants being referred from one organisation to the next.",29,229,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00229
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"What I propose is that all state schemes be funnelled through a central account manager, with one such manager paired to each poor family. Social workers at Family Service Centres (FSCs) seem to me to be best placed to play this role. These account managers should be empowered to channel and administer all state schemes. They should also have visibility on schemes that are automatically administered, like Silver Support and Workfare, so that they can also address issues or errors there and so that they can take a more holistic view of the family's situation.",30,230,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00230
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"To mirror the one account manager for social welfare support, each poor family and low-income worker should have one account manager in charge of employability at WSG. That manager should be empowered and mandated to coach the worker to access the large array of work and training schemes. Their mandate should not merely be process-driven, meaning they should not be limited to training them on CV-writing techniques or asking them to sign up to passive job alerts. But they should also proactively work with their beneficiaries to assess different opportunities and find the right one, like a consultant and coach would do.",31,231,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00231
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I have spoken in this House previously on how some state employability counsellors in some other countries take a results-driven approach.,32,232,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00232
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"An employability account manager for the disadvantaged would also be in a position to nudge their beneficiaries to upskill or reskill to move out of ""at-risk"" jobs before they are made obsolete. This recommendation is linked to my earlier call to expand the supply of such training and conversion places.",33,233,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00233
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The second issue involves the current process of applying for financial assistance being too complex and exhausting. For example, the interviewing of family members by agencies, in some cases, is unnecessary. Some applicants are deterred from pursuing their Financial Assistance applications because of the humiliation that they would feel if agencies call their relatives. I repeat my call for Financial Assistance to be provided based on declarations as to whether family support is being obtained, without the need for interviewing family members, and with strong disincentives associated with making false statements.",34,234,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00234
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, when seeking Financial Assistance, ComCare Short- to Medium-Term Assistance currently gives assistance for an average of only six months. To avoid the uncertainty and stress that comes with having to renew the support every few months, a longer-term grant can be given, albeit tied to conditions which I will touch on in a minute. This addresses the disruption of some beneficiaries having their Financial Assistance suddenly cut off when they find a job or increase their pay beyond a certain threshold. There should be a certain runway where the Financial Assistance continues after such events to enable the beneficiary to settle debts, to adapt to the new income structure and so on.",35,235,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00235
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, on the Financial Assistance application process. Applicants are sometimes asked to produce various documents that they may no longer have. Some are asked to hold physical meetings at the SSO office, which can be very hard for them if they are taking care of young children or working. Can social workers visit beneficiaries more frequently at their homes, which would help them to better assess their living conditions? And this is a topic that I have raised before. Can we convince more beneficiaries also to grant the agency direct access to past records residing with banks or Government agencies so that the absence of documents does not become the impediment it often is?",36,236,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00236
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, let me address how we can increase the quantum of Financial Assistance available based on the beneficiary committing to positive actions that would help them and their family. More financial assistance can be provided beyond the current scheme caps, but tied to various conditions about which the welfare account manager is best placed to decide.",37,237,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00237
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"These may include, firstly, commitment to ensure attendance of children at early intervention programmes, such as KidSTART, or attendance at school for families where absenteeism is an issue.

2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, my final topic on the administration of poverty relief would be the quantum of relief. More can be given, with part of it being conditional, as I have argued. Long-term ComCare gives individuals about $600 monthly, short- to medium-term ComCare gives a mean of $600 per household per month in FY2020, which works out to just under $270 per person per month. There are other schemes like the Workfare Income Supplement and Silver Support, but these also number in the hundreds of dollars per month. And not every person who is vulnerable accesses multiple schemes.",43,243,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00243

A letter from the SSO sometimes follows, which states that, in their conversation, the residents agreed that they were receiving certain state benefits already and, hence, they have agreed to withdraw their application for Financial Assistance. However, the fact that they initially came to the Member of Parliament underlines that there is a difference of perspective on how much is enough.",44,244,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00244
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In citing this, I want to be absolutely clear that our social workers and SSOs, generally, do their very best and do good work, but they operate within the policy parameters prescribed for them.",45,245,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00245
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, I cited research earlier showing that income levels of $1,400 and $6,400 per month have been suggested to provide a very basic standard of living for a single elder person aged 65 and above and a family of four respectively. For those aged between 55 and 64, that figure increases to $1,700 per month.",46,246,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00246
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, I would suggest that there is scope to revisit and significantly increase the quantum, duration and conditions of welfare assistance we provide to better protect the vulnerable, particularly the children and unemployable elderly. We should address the issue of poverty in a results-oriented fashion and in way that takes into consideration new research when it becomes available.",47,247,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00247
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"To be sure, I am not suggesting that welfare assistance should be unlimited and unconditional in all cases, or that the levels should be so high as to make it unattractive to work. But as we apply progressive wage laddering, the quantum that makes work unattractive will rise and this should be reflected in our welfare schemes.",48,248,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00248
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, another suggestion I have is to enable poorer individuals to contribute back to society in a manner that might most befit their abilities by empowering them to become micro-entrepreneurs. A state-backed facility should be set up to provide micro-loans to poorer individuals to set up microbusinesses, such as home-based catering businesses, for example. The financial services industry is, currently, not set up to do this.",49,249,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00249

2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Sir, I would like to touch on the social work profession. Social workers are at the core phase of dealing with poverty. Many I have spoken to feel that many of our social workers feel overworked. And this was my sense, too, when I was an FSC volunteer in the 1990s. This is a subject that has been discussed in this House a number of times. We need to invest in more manpower and we need to ensure that compensation is well matched to the rigours of the job, which can be intellectually, socially and emotionally draining.",52,252,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00252
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We can do more to set benchmarks for caseloads and increase headcount when these benchmarks are breached. Social workers will find it hard to help others if they are looking for help themselves. Social workers with sufficient capacity are the best people to provide advice and support on more complex issues and not just disburse money. They could be like venture capitalists, investing in people and also providing them with critical advice and coaching to help realise a return on that investment. In short, social workers can help people thrive.",53,253,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00253
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The last subject I would like to address in my speech is to call for the release of better data to tackle the issues of poverty and social mobility. Better data helps public debate and helps us figure out what works and what does not. And in tackling a problem that is as complex and resistant to simple solutions as poverty is, such data is critical for performance management for the goals we have set. We need to invest in a rigorous measurement of intergenerational social mobility at least once every decade, a call I have made before. And a nationally recognised poverty line should be established, which could aid social workers in making decisions, a call made in this House by my colleague, then Non-Constituency Nominated Member Mr Yee Jenn Jong, in 2013.",54,254,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00254
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We should also keep data on child poverty, which is key to intergenerational poverty and which many other countries do publish. I propose that we track the intergenerational rate of reliance on ComCare Financial Assistance and rental housing. One head of an FSC who had been in the field for over 20 years told me that he was receiving cases of young families that were the children of cases he had handled as a young social worker. This is a poverty cycle we must break.",55,255,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00255

Any relevant public survey of studies that relate to this should, by default, be published.",57,257,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00257
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, in waging war on poverty, there are many other policy tools we need in our arsenal that I will not have time to expand on and hope the conversation will continue. For example, my colleagues, Members of Parliament Gerald Giam and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, have tirelessly spoken about minimum wages in this House. Member of Parliament Louis Chua moved an Adjournment Motion about expanding the supply of rental housing, while Member of Parliament Faisal Manap did the same on motorcycle COEs. Workers' Party chair Ms Sylvia Lim has spoken passionately on social mobility. In this Budget debate, the Leader of the Opposition, Member of Parliament Ms He Ting Ru and other Workers' Party Members of Parliament have argued for other policies that will help the poor and the vulnerable, including why the Government's 28% GST hike is unhelpful and unnecessary, which is why the Workers' Party cannot support the Budget. A 28% hike refers to the increase in GST rate from 7% to 9% – that is, a 28% increase.",58,258,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00258
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to wrap up by asking a simple question. Is spending more and investing more effort in fighting poverty and breaking the poverty cycle really worth it? I understand that changing our mindset and paying to tackle poverty costs money. But we have done this before. In Year One of COVID-19, almost 200,000 self-employed people were given $1,000 a month.",59,259,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00259
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There will be returns from investing in a war on poverty and breaking the poverty cycle. If the help is provided in a results-oriented, holistic way, with sufficient dollars, there is every reason to believe that that spending will diminish over time and yield broader social and economic and even sociopolitical benefits, as more people improve themselves in terms of health, life skills, employability and – that most precious commodity of all – self-belief and confidence in themselves.",60,260,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00260
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We must not judge our success solely on how much GDP growth we have achieved each year, but also by how much poverty we have eliminated. In recent years, it is unclear if we are making success on this front, with no real downtrend in demand for ComCare, rental flats and other assistance schemes. We must break this cycle and make a substantial dent on poverty.",61,261,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00261

2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, I support this Budget. I will deal with three matters in my speech  first, the war in Ukraine and its implications for Singapore; second, our response to COVID-19; third, I have some suggestions in relation to public housing.",1,264,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00264
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"First, on the war in Ukraine. This war broke out after the Budget Statement, but before this debate. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the largest conflict on the European continent since World War II. There remain risks that this conflict may escalate further. The eruption of conflict has already created turbulence in financial and commodity markets. It is anticipated that, in the long term, various commodities may rise in prices, adding to inflation.",2,265,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00265
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I support the principled position that Singapore has taken in relation to this dispute. While we are not against any country, we stand firmly against this invasion as a violation of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty. As at the time of this speech, it remains the case that despite the violation of international law, Ukraine is largely fighting alone against Russia. However, the international community has been swift in taking action, including tough economic sanctions, against Russia.",3,266,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00266
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),This raises a number of related issues for us to consider. The first is that defence spending is vital and we must ensure we have the capability and resources to survive in the event war is visited on us. While I expect we will have more details on the defence spending in MINDEF’s Committee of Supply – I have filed several cuts on that – I think we need to remain committed to defence spending and national defence even during times of peace. There will be many demands on our spending in the coming years and it is always tempting to say we should cut defence spending in times of peace. This would clearly be a mistake.,4,267,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00267
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second is we must continue to maintain and build good and deep relations as well as mutually beneficial economic ties with as many countries as possible. We hope never to go to war, but the stronger and deeper our ties with the world around us, the better our chances of avoiding war and also of getting support from the international community in the event we are drawn into a war. It is always a big ask for others to join our conflict, but they may help in other ways, which will be vital.",5,268,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00268
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),Third – and this is more short term – I would also like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he sees any significant economic turmoil from the war in Ukraine on us and whether any additional measures may need to be taken in the Budget to provide for this.,6,269,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00269
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second topic – and now coming to home more directly – is our response to COVID-19. Singapore has done an excellent job of handling this crisis. We have taken a generally cautious, science- and evidence-led approach that has enabled us to achieve a high vaccination rate amongst the population and kept fatalities at a relatively low rate. The main price we have paid is living with social restrictions, which have taken a toll both on the economy and on the mental health of some of our people.",7,270,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00270
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Over the last few months, with Omicron spreading, COVID-19 has been affecting even many in our highly-vaccinated population. I, myself, came down with COVID-19 in December when I was with my family in the UK.",8,271,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00271
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The UK's approach to COVID-19 was quite different from Singapore's and, while there were some restrictions in place, including requirements to wear masks indoors, many activities had resumed when we were there. These included football matches, dining at restaurants and eateries and watching plays and performances. Of course, this is probably part of the reason I came down with COVID-19, as did my daughter.",9,272,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00272
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, for both of us, the experience was not particularly bad. Although we had mild symptoms for a few days, we did not test positive until our pre-departure test, where my daughter and I tested positive. Thereafter, we isolated ourselves, in line with the UK's guidelines at the time. However, within about two days, we were testing negative again and our symptoms were relatively mild. In my case, just a slight sore throat and runny nose.",10,273,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00273
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"As we spoke to more people, we realised that almost everyone knew someone or had family or friends who had come down with COVID-19 and some had come down with it themselves. For most, it was not debilitating and life could go on.",11,274,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00274
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Of course, this is not to trivialise the COVID-19 experience. My wife and I had three shots of the vaccine and this, probably, helped us in resisting and overcoming the virus. My daughter had the benefit of youth.",12,275,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00275
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, from what we understand, the immunocompromised and those with pre-existing ailments remain vulnerable to serious complications. Additionally, there are studies in the UK pointing to a group of people who suffer symptoms called ""long COVID"", which means they have different after-effects following a COVID-19 infection, some of which can be serious and debilitating.",13,276,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00276
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"My suggestion is that it may be better for us to proceed with plans to ease our restrictions and move closer to life as normal but, at the same time, remind and educate the more vulnerable to take extra precautions. We need to reiterate the message that, for those with COVID-19 who are either asymptomatic or who have mild symptoms, there is no need to visit the doctor or the hospital. If necessary, sceptical employers who are asking for medical certificates can ask employees to send photographs of their current ART test results for human resource (HR) record purposes.",14,277,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00277
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I understand that even with the relatively large number of COVID-19 cases that are emerging every day, our hospitals remain able to cope with those who need urgent assistance. Our population is amongst the best vaccinated in the world. I think we are ready to open up.",15,278,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00278
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The third topic I wish to discuss, quite different from the earlier two, relates to housing.",16,279,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00279
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In my Meet-the-People session (MPS) cases, appeals in relation to housing are one of the common ones that come up. Housing affordability and availability are a concern for many residents.",17,280,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00280
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One of the curious issues that has arisen during the pandemic is that the housing market has heated up, both in the public and private sector. I think this is a combination of both increased demand and tightening supply.",18,281,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00281
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"On the demand side, as more people are at home, the more people seek more personal space for themselves and family members. Thus, in large extended families, various members may wish to move out into houses of their own. New couples getting married want their own place as it may be difficult to move in with either of the parents. Appeals for new flats emerge regularly in my MPS.",19,282,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00282
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"On the supply side, Build-to-Order (BTO) development has slowed down somewhat because of delays in construction. Additionally, the resale market has been limited by the imposition of minimum occupation periods, or MOPs, for both resale and new flats. I had filed Parliamentary Questions on this previously and MND had indicated in its response that it did not believe removing MOP would increase housing supply and may encourage speculation because people who sell their flats may then look to buy new ones.",20,283,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00283
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I do not agree with this view entirely and I would suggest, perhaps, initially, HDB may wish to consider removing the MOP for resale flats while retaining it for new flats. This was actually the state of affairs for many years before MOP was extended to resale flats as well. Even without MOP, there are other disincentives to flipping flats, including the seller's stamp duty, which is higher if a flat is sold within a shorter holding period.",21,284,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00284
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In my view, one of the biggest drivers for new BTOs is that there is a huge price discrepancy between resale flats and new flats. A new flat is both brand new and has a fresh lease, and it comes at a lower price. So, as a result of this, there is almost no logical reason for anyone to buy a resale flat unless they feel they have no choice.",22,285,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00285
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At the same time, people who buy resale flats also get a feeling they are getting a raw deal and are envious of those who get new flats at a lower price. This exaggerates the ""lottery effect"" of new flats and those who are eligible for it vis-a-vis those who are not or who are lower on the priority list start feeling more resentful.",23,286,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00286
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"My humble suggestion would be to take away the MOP for resale flats. This would, at least, create a greater supply of resale flats, which should ease their prices.",24,287,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00287
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I also do not expect this to be a one-off effect because, if a resale flat is bought, it could still be put on the market again if needed, whereas now, if a resale flat is bought, it would be out of the market for at least five years, hence, constraining supply. So, in that sense, every transaction constrains the resale market further.",25,288,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00288
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"It would also give resale flat buyers the benefit of flexibility – at least, one tangible benefit for the huge premium they would otherwise be paying.",26,289,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00289
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Currently, the two most common HDB appeals I get are either for new flats or to reduce the MOP because families need to change their living arrangements as a result of changing circumstances.",27,290,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00290
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I think one of the reasons for the high demand for BTOs, in particular, is the disparity in prices between resale flats and BTO flats. And I would suggest that, ideally, the price of a BTO flat with the resale levy should be somewhat comparable to a resale flat so that they become easy options for buyers to choose from. I believe that if more buyers are prepared to go to the resale market to buy their flats and the resale market is accessible, this would reduce the heavy demand we have for BTO flats at the moment.",28,291,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00291
2022-03-02-T-006,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, if this disparity falls enough, such that Government grants would make buying resale flats as attractive as new flats even for those who are house hunting, I think this would also further reduce the current pent-up demand for BTOs and the lottery effect people are feeling from this.",29,292,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00292

2022-03-02-T-006,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In terms of investing in our children, another area which I hope we can consider is to defray the costs of preschool and after-school care services, such as exempting the GST for these monthly expenses.

During the course of my thematic e-townhalls which focus on embracing parenthood, as well as my regular house visits, several of my residents with autistic children have shared with me that, notwithstanding the fact that they belonged to the middle-income group, they find themselves financially stretched due to the costs incurred for signing up their children into the early intervention programmes and speech therapy sessions, coupled with the expenses incurred by them every month for enrolling their children in a kindergarten or childcare centre. All of these expenses are subject to GST.",8,302,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00302

2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The issue of the GST increase has been debated quite extensively in this House and I understand that Members have opposing views on whether the GST should or should not be increased. I believe it is fair to say that almost all Members, if not all Members of the House, would agree that more can and should be done for the less privileged in society and those with more should contribute more. The fundamental question is, of course, how that more should be funded. Should we continue to draw more from the reserves? Should we significantly raise income tax and corporate tax? Should we base property taxes on property values? Should we tax the wealthy based on the value of their wealth portfolio? Should we use more of the NIRC and, if so, how much more – 60%, 70% and so on?",2,325,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00325

Let us not use a sledgehammer and swing away wildly when perhaps a discerning use of a chisel might be more appropriate.",3,326,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00326
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"As such, I do understand the rationale behind the GST increase and commend the Government for being sensitive in implementing the GST increase in two stages, in 2023 and 2024, so that the immediate impact of the increase is not felt and this will give everyone, both consumers and companies, time to prepare for the hike.",4,327,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00327

2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"With these schemes, the net transference from the Government to lower-income families and those who need it will increase from the current sum and the impact of GST increase on lower-income families will not be felt for many years. I believe that this transference and these schemes are really quite seamless and the effort for many of those who need it is quite minimal to access these schemes and that would significantly thus reduce the impact of any bandwidth tax that was mentioned earlier by our colleague, Mr Leon Perera, in his speech.",6,329,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00329
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"As I have mentioned before, it is important to have a holistic taxation strategy and it is commendable that the Government is looking beyond GST as a revenue source and is also exploring other alternative sources of taxation revenue via other forms of progressive taxes, such as the increase in personal income tax for those with an annual income of more than $500,000 and an increase in property tax for non-owner-occupied property and owner-occupied property with an annual value of more than $30,000. The revisions in the rate of these progressive taxes will help to ensure that the overall tax regime in Singapore remains resilient, with those with more means contributing more than those with less. Notice I have said ""those with more"", not ""those with a lot"". So, as long as I have more than you, I should be happy and willing to contribute to you.

It has changed the way we utilise spaces, interact with one another and how we build social relationships. The stress of having to live with the pandemic, the need to face medical unknowns related to the disease, the increase in contestation for living and working spaces, job and income insecurity, and having to constantly navigate the ever-changing COVID-19 management measures, have left many of us physically exhausted, emotionally spent and mentally drained.",9,332,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00332
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"When we think about mental wellness, we have to understand that different groups of people have different mental wellness needs as they can be affected by the same stressors differently. We recognise this, of course, if we look at mental wellness for the youths, mental wellness that affects seniors, postpartum depression when it comes to women who have just given birth and so on. So, rather than to treat mental wellness as a collective term, it will thus be beneficial for us to recognise that, just like these other different segments of society, men are also affected very differently by stresses.",10,333,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00333
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In many societies today, some patriarchal beliefs continue to be commonly held by the majority of the population and there are corresponding societal expectations of how men should behave in social settings.

More worryingly, when depressed, men are more likely to engage in negative coping techniques, such as alcoholism, which may, ironically, lead to other forms of health problems in the long run.",13,336,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00336

2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),I believe that we should go upstream to educate men about the importance of mental wellness and let them know that there are sources available to them when they need help. Could our Secondary schools or tertiary institutions not develop dedicated resources and platforms to teach male students how to dispel traditionally toxic masculine stereotypes and encourage them to step forward and feel comfortable to speak up about their struggles and seek help?,16,339,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00339
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Could MINDEF consider running programmes educating our NSFs and soldiers about the importance of mental wellness and promote the idea that it is okay to seek help? It is okay to be not okay. To help them move away from the stereotype that you should shed blood and not tears because ""real men don't cry?"" I believe that having such mental wellness programmes and demolishing archaic male stereotypes are not incompatible with training our soldiers to be tough and resilient.",17,340,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00340
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Making our young men better soldiers by making them more aware of their mental wellness also prepares them to be better men for the rest of their lives. I would also hope that the Government can devote some resources to having more community-based platforms that specifically cater to men who are presently struggling with mental wellness. For example, one could start with mental well-being activities in community clubs and centres that cater to men and perhaps this could evolve into dedicated structured support group sessions that men could attend. The ultimate aim of this would be to destigmatise help-seeking behaviour from men as signs of weakness by creating a more gender-neutral society and providing platforms where men, and women, feel comfortable to discuss mental wellness issues.",18,341,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00341
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, there are those who have described this as a ""Robin Hood"" Budget; that is, ""take from the rich to give to the poor"". But to use that term is to draw lines of divisions between just ""what or who"" is rich and ""what or who"" is poor and dishes out unhelpful labels that can only be divisive in our society.",19,342,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00342
2022-03-02-T-006,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The heart of good governance is about creating a strong social compact, and the social compact is constantly evolving as our society progresses. And a key feature of our social compact is reflected in this Budget, which signals that those of us who are blessed to have more should contribute more, and those of us who need more help should get the help that they need. Rather than reducing it to a blunt tool about simply taking from one group and giving to another, I see this Budget more as reinforcing a uniquely Singaporean version of ""noblesse oblige"" where those who are in positions of relative privilege and wealth – and I use the word, ""relative"" again, Mr Speaker – have the social duty and obligation to take care of those who have less.",20,343,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00343

It would be wonderful if this philosophy could permeate into every single Singaporean social consciousness, whereby, regardless of our income levels, we are willing to contribute not just our money, but also our time to those who need our help and assistance. Because that is what a family does, Mr Speaker  those who are stronger, take care of those who are not as strong; those who can, help those who are trying; those who have more, help those who have less. Everyone does their part. And it is only by staying strong as one united Singaporean family that we are going to get through the economic and societal challenges of the years ahead.

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I am surprised that he raised this, in the first place, as a means of generating revenue. Tobacco taxes, for example, are a regressive tax – the lower-income groups pay a bigger share of it. The Workers' Party had expressed such strong concerns about the regressivity of the GST, but does not appear to be the least concerned about regressivity here. Why the double standards? In any case, we do not levy sin taxes for purposes of generating revenue, but for deterring consumption, and we will review and adjust these taxes from time to time. For carbon tax, as I have already highlighted, we will channel the revenue to help with the green transition. So, this will not help to meet our structural funding gap.",138,489,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00489

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),Some ask  what happens if inflation turns out to be more persistent or higher? Would it not be better to wait until we are sure that inflation has come down before raising GST?,141,492,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00492
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As I have mentioned before, I fully understand the concerns about inflation and cost of living, but we cannot keep delaying the GST increase, given our pressing revenue needs.

We do, in fact, take into account different household formations in studying the effects of our policies and we adjust our policies where necessary.

This is more than their annual total GST expenses – not the increase – more than their total annual GST expenses of around $2,000 per year over this same period.

Put another way, Government benefits will nearly double the amount of resources for these households. It is a significant and tangible form of support.",42,554,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00554
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Of course, as incomes go up, the net benefits are correspondingly reduced. The higher-income are net contributors – they contribute more than they receive. But they, too, benefit. They benefit from the political stability, social cohesion and overall environment that we provide in Singapore.",43,555,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00555
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Some Members have asked if we are doing enough for the sandwich middle-income group. If you look at the chart, for those in the 40th to 60th percentiles of household income, they continue to receive more benefits than the taxes they pay. For those in the 60th to 90th percentiles of household incomes, they pay some taxes, after netting off the subsidies and transfers they receive.",44,556,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00556
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I understand the pressures faced by this group. Some are caregivers who bear a heavy burden financially and emotionally, even physically.",45,557,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00557
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is why we have been mindful to make sure we expand our suite of broad-based support in areas like education and healthcare. We have also increased healthcare and caregiving-related subsidies and support to relieve the load on these families, especially for those who care for young ones and elderly parents.",46,558,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00558
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Importantly, we have taken extra care to keep the tax burden for this group low. In fact, their tax burden is significantly lower than what it is for their equivalent in most other cities. For the relatively low amount of taxes paid, they enjoy many benefits in Singapore  affordable public housing and healthcare, beautiful parks, excellent infrastructure, quality preschools, schools and tertiary institutions with highly-subsidised fees.",47,559,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00559
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, when you put it altogether, this is how we have designed our fiscal system  one, a fair revenue structure with everyone contributing, but those with greater means contribute more; two, a fair system of subsidies and transfers where all benefit but those who are less well-off benefit more; three, a system where we keep taxes on middle-income households low by targeting our social safety nets at the more vulnerable households who really need the support, while ensuring universal access to high-quality public housing, education and healthcare.",48,560,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00560
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"When you put all three together, we have a highly progressive system of taxes and transfers where the better-off contribute more and receive less in tax-funded benefits while the less well-off still contribute, but a smaller amount, and receive much more in benefits.",49,561,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00561
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is reflected in our benefit-to-tax ratios, something which many Members are familiar with but which is worth reiterating. [Please refer to Annex 5.]",50,562,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00562
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The bottom 20% of Singaporean households receive about $4 in benefits for every tax dollar paid, the middle 20% of Singaporean households receive about $2 in benefits for every tax dollar paid and the top 20% of Singaporean households are net contributors receiving about $0.30 in benefits for every tax dollar paid.",51,563,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00563
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,These ratios that we have achieved for the lower- and middle-income households are no mean feat at all. And we will have to continue working hard to maintain this in the coming years.,52,564,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00564

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the years, I have had the chance to study the fiscal systems of many other jurisdictions. I can confidently say that Singapore is unique in having such a highly progressive system of taxes and transfers, while keeping the overall tax burden low for everyone and especially for the middle-income. We have a system that is fair, progressive and effective. It reflects our values  what we stand for and who we are as a people, and it provides a strong foundation for us to build our economy and our society.",54,566,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00566

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"After 25 years of public service, I know it is almost impossible for the Government to do anything that pleases everyone all of the time. But I want to assure everyone that every move we make is considered very carefully. We weigh the costs and benefits and the implications. We discuss extensively with all stakeholders, especially our tripartite partners. And that is what the team and I in MOF have worked very hard to do in this Budget – to ensure a balanced and fair package of measures, adjusting what is necessary to meet our evolving needs, while bearing in mind our economic and social imperatives and, above all, upholding the principles of fiscal prudence and sustainability.",57,569,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00569

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I know many are concerned about the impact of the Ukraine crisis. The Government is closely monitoring the situation.

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,That is why we have the enhanced Assurance Package (AP) and the GST Vouchers (GSTV) to offset the GST expenses of households. Both will be implemented starting from later this year before the GST increase takes effect.,66,578,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00578

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides the GST, we have also made other tax changes in this Budget, like the income and property taxes, so that those with higher incomes and who own properties with an annual value over $30,000 pay more taxes.",71,583,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00583
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These tax changes will generate additional revenue which we urgently need to fund our rising Government expenditures, especially in the area of healthcare, so that we can take better care of our seniors.",72,584,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00584
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But we are doing this in a way that is fair and progressive. That means everyone pays something in taxes.

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I believe the changes to the tax structure we introduced this Budget will help to strengthen our social compact and social cohesion because we are all chipping in and doing our part to tackle our challenges and build a better Singapore together.,76,588,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00588

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That means debating the issues based on facts and not biased soundbites, or worse, half-truths and lies.

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In this Budget, I have set out plainly the challenges and also the opportunities ahead of us and explained why we need to move on difficult measures like the GST increase.

We do not begrudge those who do well. Instead, we celebrate them and we take pride in their achievements. At the same time, for those who have succeeded, there is no need to flaunt one’s wealth or be ostentatious about it. Instead, keep a modest and unassuming approach and do your part to give back to society, so that wealth can be recycled and invested back into society to expand opportunities for others.",87,599,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00599

2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would also like to thank the Finance Minister, particularly for the acknowledgement towards the Workers' Party for coming up with alternative revenue proposals for the Government's consideration. And we did so, of course, knowing that since the decision to raise GST was announced a few years ago, circumstances have changed.",1,606,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00606
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"COVID-19 was unanticipated, of course. And core inflation right now is at its highest level in nine years. I think the prices of goods and services are not a point I need to repeat. Minister would know, thanks to CPI information from MAS and MTI, that price pressures will impact Singaporeans, particularly at the low- and middle-income levels.",2,607,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00607
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),This is even as the question is important with respect to raising the GST at this time. The Minister made some brief points about it. He had thought about it carefully. But I think the question remains  is this a reasonable thing to do in these circumstances? That is the first question.,3,608,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00608
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And I think the point arises more acutely when you take into account what market watchers have said about the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0, which may well result in corporate tax revenue gains for Singapore. And I think this is a point that has been raised at the start of the week, coinciding with this Budget debate.",4,609,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00609
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To that end, my question is  can I ask what are the Government's current estimates, given that there is an implementation deadline of 2023 for BEPS? What is the range of estimates of the net impact of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 on our corporate income tax revenues? Surely, MOF would have prepared itself for these various scenarios. And can I confirm that MOF does not have these various scenarios planned out?",5,610,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00610
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This really brings up the other point the Minister raised about red herrings, that, somehow, when the Opposition asks for revenue and expenditure projections, these are red herrings. But it cannot be so. Because, as I have mentioned in my Budget speech, it is something that many jurisdictions do. Hong Kong has a medium range forecast right up to fiscal year 2026/2027. They have got assumptions, of course. You are projecting into the future, so, it cannot be perfect and I think people will give the Government buffer and leeway for that. But that is incredibly important and that is precisely why the Workers' Party put forward different revenue streams.",6,611,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00611
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Minister rounded off at the end about the importance of information, facts. I completely agree with him. But would not this approach not to make a call for information, characterising it as a red herring, but actually just producing that information lead to the outcome that the Minister himself speaks of and reduces the prospect of individuals mischaracterising positions which, one could argue, has also been done in the course of this debate? I think there were arguments made in the extreme which were not put forward by Workers' Party (WP) Members of Parliament. I do not think anybody suggested raising personal income tax for the upper tier up to 42% to make up for the GST hole. That was not done. But it was, nonetheless, characterised as an Opposition idea. So, I think it is a case of what is good for the goose must be good for the gander. And this is something I hope can actually be alleviated through more projections of what the Government needs, how much it is going to collect, because this will result in a more fruitful debate.",7,612,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00612
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the course of my Budget speech, I did make a point about the revenue that the carbon tax will bring in. I hear the Minister's point. He said it in the beginning, when he opened the debate. He is saying it now. He does not expect carbon tax to bring in new sources of revenue. But still a debate has to be had. What are those numbers? Particularly, when you look at utility prices, utility bills for average Singaporeans, which the Minister says in his speech are going up. I believe he used a 25-year timeline. But if you follow it in a linear fashion, that is $12 by 2030 – an increase.",8,613,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00613
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"So, those numbers should really be brought forward by the Government so that we can debate these and talk about how people, both at the lower- and middle-income levels, can be supported in a better way.",9,614,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00614
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I think the Minister raised a number of other points. We spoke about the various levers. The other WP Members, of course, will chip in and make those clarifications with the Minister. But Mr Louis Chua is not here today. He will be happy to come into this debate, I can assure you, but he is self-isolating, just to be on the safe side. I think he was COVID-19-positive yesterday but it was a false positive. So, I think better for him to stay away. But he will definitely come back to this in the course of what happens with BEPS and actually what are those projections that the Government is working with vis-a-vis its impact.",10,615,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00615
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A number of other points, like I said, I will let the other WP Members come in. But I think there is a useful question to ask about the reserves. We have had this exchange in this House a number of times on our position on the reserves. I do not think it is an accurate reflection to say that, first instance, you look at and turn to the reserves. That is not true.",11,616,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00616
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And we have really made the Government's own approach informed in this House as to how it also takes a certain approach to change how it deals with the reserves mechanism, at quite short intervals – 2008, 2015. We are entering a decade where circumstances are changing quite significantly. The Minister himself recognised in his Budget speech that, I believe, there is a review of even healthcare resourcing at paragraph 239  ""We are thinking through this healthier SG strategy carefully. It will entail a review of our resourcing approach and healthcare financing schemes as well as the need for upstream investments and preventive healthcare.""",12,617,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00617
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"So, clearly, the other numbers that were in his speech about potentially where we could be with healthcare expenditure if we do not keep it in check, may not really be what will, eventually, be the outcome, because there is a review going on.",13,618,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00618
2022-03-02-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Pritam Singh, this part is really for clarification. So, I will allow preamble and, as Leader of Opposition, I am prepared to allow you some leeway. But let us keep to the point.",1,619,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00619
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I take the point.",1,620,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00620
2022-03-02-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"And before I end, just a reminder to the rest of the Members, this is meant for clarification. So, if you have some preamble, I would allow it, but please limit that time.",1,621,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00621

2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Let me just then come to the point before I hand it over to the other colleagues of mine to make clarifications. It was previously said that we have drawn on our reserves equivalent to 20 years of past Budget surpluses. This was the Government position vis-a-vis COVID-19. ""We have used a generation's worth of savings to combat a crisis of a generation.""",2,623,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00623
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"My colleague, Mr Louis Chua, asked Deputy Prime Minister Heng, in his capacity as Finance Minister previously, after accounting for the draw, where would our reserves be, compared to five years ago and 10 years ago? And he made the point that this really was not answered and he put the question to Finance Minister Lawrence Wong. After having a better fix on the number, $42.9 billion drawn on Past Reserves, where would our reserves be today, as compared to five years ago? Is it higher or is it lower? I think that is a question that can be answered in one word.",3,624,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00624
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for these comments and questions. There are few of them and I will take them in turn.",1,625,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00625
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, on the increase of GST. It was a very difficult decision for all the reasons I have explained  recognising, on the one hand, the concerns that Singaporeans have about higher prices but, on the other hand, the urgent and very pressing revenue needs we have to address. That is why I highlighted that I decided, eventually, to delay the GST and to stagger the increase over two years.",2,626,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00626
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I suppose Mr Singh's point is that even that is not enough.,3,627,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00627
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And I can understand that some people might feel and be concerned that even that delay and that staggering are not sufficient to address concerns, especially in light of the recent developments in the external environment. And that is why I mentioned just now that the best way to deal with this is  firstly, if, indeed, inflation turns out to be more persistent and higher than expected – which may happen – we will deal with that decisively and separately, and we have the tools and resources to do so. How? Well, we have monetary policy to deal with inflation; secondly, we are able to take a series of actions to better secure our energy supplies; and, thirdly, we can help households and businesses directly. We have the resources to do so. And, if the need arises, we will not hesitate to take all of these actions. So, that is the first assurance we have for everyone.",4,628,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00628
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second assurance is that, even setting aside additional measures and actions, we have already done a lot. And I have been trying to explain that. Look at the significant help that is on the table today  household support package this year, plus Assurance Package and the GST Vouchers, both of which have been enhanced, combined together, and both being rolled out this year before the GST goes up. A lot of help, which will, for most households, delay the impact of the GST increase by five years or more.",5,629,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00629
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, the two, taken together, I think should assure everyone that we are not doing this in a cavalier manner at all. We considered it very, very carefully before we decided to proceed. And making sure that we are taking all the necessary actions and steps and have contingency measures in place to take care of the concerns of every Singaporean. That is number one.",6,630,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00630
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, on projections, numbers and data, I accept Mr Singh's point. I was not attempting to characterise it unfairly. I was sharing my feelings about these repeated requests for information as perhaps distracting us from the real issues. But I accept Mr Singh's clarification and I assure him that he has my commitment that we will continue to put out more information, as much as possible, in order to provide for more informed debates.",7,631,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00631
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And I hope he also takes what he said seriously, that the Opposition will also exercise leeway in recognising that these projections in the outer years are inherently fraught with a great deal of uncertainty, especially for a small, little, open economy like Singapore, where so many external events can never be predicted with any degree of certainty. So, very often, we do not even project GDP beyond the year. So, when you talk about outer year projections for the economy, for fiscal projections, there will be a very high cone of uncertainty around these numbers. And we, therefore, want to make sure that if we were to provide any figures, we do not inadvertently mislead people, cause people to have the wrong impression. And I seek the Leader of the Opposition's understanding, too, that, in putting out such figures in the future, we may very well get it wrong, because there is a lot of uncertainty when we project into the outer years. But he has my commitment that we will continue to see how we can improve the data and information that we put out.",8,632,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00632
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, on the reserves, I have explained our position and why changes in the rules, done hastily, we think, are not wise, are not prudent and will come at the detriment of the next generation. If we have to change any rules, we will have to seriously consider them very, very carefully. But if we make any tweaks in parameters – more land sales, more NIRC – what it basically means at the end of the day is that our future generations will be the ones to have to carry the burden. They will have to pay more in taxes in the future. That is what it comes down to. And they will have that much less to deal with any future emergencies, which we all know, will come at a more frequent rate in the coming years.",9,633,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00633
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, all I say is, let us have a care about this. And I do not think it is prudent to make this change now, in place of raising the GST or other tax changes, which we can and should do.",10,634,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00634
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As for the quantum of reserves, I have actually mentioned that in my speech. I said that our reserves are growing. We would not be able to tell you what the actual figure is, for the reasons I have explained. It is not in our national interest. But as I have said in my speech, our reserves are growing.",11,635,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00635
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But our economy, our needs, the complexity of our needs and the magnitude of the challenges we face are growing even faster. What is more important when you drill it down is, are we accumulating more than necessary?",12,636,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00636
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And the answer is no. How do we know that this is the case? Because our NIRC, as I mentioned before, we project will continue to grow at a rate that keeps pace with economic growth. That is how we know that we are not over-accumulating. Whatever we are getting from NIRC today at 3.5% of GDP, on average, over the past few years, we do not expect that to continue rising as a share of GDP. It will keep pace with economic growth.",13,637,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00637
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And as I mentioned in my speech, even that, we cannot be sure that we can achieve that. But if we are able to do so, it will already be a significant achievement because of all the headwinds that we are facing in the global investment environment.",14,638,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00638
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think I have answered all the questions from Mr Singh, Sir.",15,639,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00639
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Oh, sorry. One more question – BEPS. For BEPS, again, this is one of those things. We have been studying this very carefully. And, as I mentioned just now on Pillar 1, the rules are still being finetuned. It is not over yet. It is still being discussed.",16,640,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00640
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Yes, there is the pronouncement of 2023, but I do not know for a fact that this will happen in 2023 because many details are still being worked out. So, that is one of the reasons why I mentioned I hesitate to put out any figures at this stage.",17,641,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00641
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But taking the earlier point about putting out more information for a more informed debate, we will go back and think about whether we might provide a range of estimates about what the impact of BEPS 2.0 might be for both Pillars 1 and 2. I would say it would range from neutral to perhaps some increase, but we will have to look at the figures. We will provide some figures, hopefully, to help everyone get a better sense of what it might be.",18,642,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00642
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"What is more important, especially the point I mentioned, which is that even if Pillars 1 and 2, combined, yield us additional revenue, we will very likely have to reinvest that revenue back into ensuring we remain competitive and attract our fair share of investments.",19,643,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00643
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Why? Because the reality is competition for investments is not going to go away just because of BEPS 2.0. In fact, it will get even more intense, and it will intensify in other non-tax areas, which we will, therefore, have to fund and have resources ready for. So, even if there is a plus from BEPS 2.0, I am, in fact, not confident that that additional revenue will help us with our social spending needs, and, especially not for our healthcare spending needs, which will continue to rise very sharply.",20,644,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00644

2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I thank the Minister for the reply. I think it just reinforces the point that I have been trying to make about the alternative revenue streams that the Workers' Party came up with in the course of this debate, knowing that there are quite fundamental changes taking place worldwide where we need a better fix on what the revenue situation will be.",1,646,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00646
2022-03-02-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I think the Minister missed out one question that I also put in my speech about the carbon tax and the estimates that the Government has with its increase at the tiers up to 2030. I think those numbers would be appreciated. Even though I take Minister's point, as I mentioned in my earlier clarification, that he does not foresee this to be a revenue generator, if I can put it that way. But I think this is something that we should have a debate about, in good time.",2,647,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00647

I hope the Speaker will allow me to ask all the six questions, but let me ask two questions first.",2,650,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00650
2022-03-02-T-006,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"I have given a number of the tax burden of the GST on the middle class to be $1.2 billion. Take away all the compensating packages that you are going to give them, divide the taxpayers into three groups. Top 20%, the middle class who will not get permanent vouchers, and those taxpayers who will get permanent vouchers. How is the $3 billion or $3.5 billion additional GST going to spread over these three groups? That is question one.",3,651,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00651
2022-03-02-T-006,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question two  PSP has not been talking a lot about alternative sources of revenue because we think there is a lot of justification to make use of the unutilised revenues. But if you look at alternative avenues, actually, it is very easy from our point of view. The second question  if you have to choose between a 2% GST hike and a 3% to 4% personal income tax hike on the top 10%, they will yield about the same amount of revenue, would you still choose the GST 2% hike?",4,652,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00652
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, let me answer the second question first because it is quite straightforward. The sums do not add up, Mr Leong. The sums do not add up. A 2-percentage point to 3-percentage point increase in the top personal income tax rate will never get anywhere close to the revenue we get from a 2% increase in GST. It will not.",1,653,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00653
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, there is no choice here. In fact, we are already raising the personal income tax rates in this Budget. We will get some money from it, but it is not enough and that is why the GST increase is needed.",2,654,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00654
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But as I have repeatedly said, the objections to GST on the basis that it hurts the poor are completely unfounded. You may disagree with the GST, fine. But do not use that as a reason for disagreeing with GST. There is no basis for that in Singapore.

I know what you are trying to do with your computations, but I have shown in my chart and in my speech a different way of showing it, which is the share of GST paid by the different groups. And you can see from that, the chart is self-explanatory, the middle 20%, the share burden that they pay for GST, the increase in GST comes down.",4,656,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00656
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Effectively, what it means is that the increase in GST, the $3.5 billion of revenues that the 2% of GST generates, will be borne by the upper-middle and the top income earners. That is what it comes down to. It shows in the effective rate chart, where you saw, when we stacked up the effective GST rates and we showed the increase in GST to 9%, that extra burden is all borne by the upper-income deciles.

It is that group that will bear the burden of the GST increase, while the rest of the population pay the GST rate, but the impact of GST expenses is offset on a continuing basis.

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I have already explained that it does not yield that figure. Just look at the revenue generated from the tax change we have just introduced in this Budget. It is nowhere in the region of billions. Nowhere!,3,664,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00664

And the question is whether the Government plans to subscribe to the spirit of the BEPS agreement as a signatory and to roll out, broadly speaking, the framework as prescribed. I mentioned this, in part, because the Workers' Party's proposal for corporate taxation is quite different from the hypothetical.",2,669,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00669

2022-03-02-T-006,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Fair enough. So, that was my first question. My second question has to do with wealth taxation and the question is whether the Minister believes that the modest increase in wealth taxation that is set forth in our proposal, which is broadly consistent with – in fact, it significantly is lower than some other neutral analysts have had, our estimate is $1.2 billion – whether he thinks that this modest increase in wealth taxation will be such that it will make Singapore so unattractive that high net worth individuals would relocate and be footloose in that sense.",1,671,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00671
2022-03-02-T-006,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"My third question has to do with land sales. I accept the position that this Government has that they treat land sales as part of reserves, but then I am wondering if the Minister is able to reconcile the treatment of land sales that are less than 10 years. So, land leases that are of one to nine years, with the broad argument that land sales must all immediately go into reserves, rather than take the first nine years as part of recurrent revenue.",2,672,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00672

It cannot be that some countries do it and others do not; and then, there are revenue leakages that will undermine Singapore.",1,673,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00673

2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On wealth taxes, I recognise a proposal from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and the Workers' Party for a net wealth tax that will yield revenue of $1.2 billion. I have explained that, yes, in theory, you could design a scheme like that. You could. But in practice, it will be much more complicated and it is not just about the fears of people leaving, but the fact that there are so many ways for high net worth individuals to circumvent whatever taxation rules you have in place and to plan away the burden of the wealth tax on themselves.",4,676,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00676
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The ones who do, are usually the ones with better means and higher wealth. And this is why, even in Switzerland, for example, if you look at the net wealth tax they have there, the burden of tax falls on a much broader base of the population. The so-called ""net wealth tax"" in Switzerland is not a wealth tax for the top-end only. Many middle-class, many middle-income people pay for that net wealth tax. This was our experience in estate duty, mind you. As I mentioned, the top-end, the very wealthy, knew how to plan it away. But the burden ended up falling on the middle-income and the upper middle-income. That is our bigger concern, on top of the concern that, yes, there will be some competitiveness reasons. That is also a relevant concern.",5,677,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00677
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And that is why we have to study this very carefully. We have to think through, look at the experiences of other jurisdictions. Not very many left to study because, as I have said, many of them have dropped the idea of doing a net wealth tax. We will have to consider what is suitable for Singapore. So, we will not rule it out. But at this stage, we do not have something that we are confident can be effectively implemented, suited to Singapore's circumstances.",6,678,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00678
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On land sales, the easy answer is, for these shorter duration leases, we have decided for flexibility and, because there are more transactions like that, there is no need to regard them as assets and, therefore, we take them in as current revenue. But for the ones with longer leases, we treat them as assets and then, therefore, we take them into our reserves framework and accord the treatment accordingly.",7,679,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00679

2022-03-02-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Sir, the Minister accused Workers' Party of double standards by calling for higher taxes on tobacco, because that is regressive. But would he not agree that more taxes on tobacco and gambling are acceptable, if they can help discourage that behaviour because the effects of that behaviour have far higher health and family costs on the lower-income and, therefore, are more regressive?",1,682,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00682
2022-03-02-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, the Minister said that those with fewer means will bear a lighter share of the GST increase, but they get more benefits from the Government and more than what they put in. That was what he said just now in his speech. He said this makes a fair and inclusive system and he repeated that point in his Chinese speech as well. And he just said just now that the burden is all borne by the upper-middle and the top deciles of income earners.",2,683,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00683
2022-03-02-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Sir, if those with fewer means really get back more than what they pay, by the Minister's logic, how will they feel that they are contributing?",3,684,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00684
2022-03-02-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And to be clear, Workers' Party is not against the lower-income getting back more, if this is, indeed, the case. But can the Minister clarify whether or not the GST hike will make the lower- and middle-income pay more in net taxes over a 20- or 30-year period?",4,685,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00685
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, I did not say that I was opposed to sin taxes or to tobacco taxes. I was simply highlighting that the Workers' Party made a big issue of regressivity in one case, but not in another case. So, I did not understand why there was inconsistency there. But we have never made a big issue of it and, in fact, we do not look at fiscal systems like that. As I have said, it is not appropriate to consider item by item. We look at the system as a whole. And where sin taxes are concerned, externality tax, we do it not for revenue-generating purposes. Yes, it generates some but not a lot. But really more for curbing consumption, which we think is necessary. And that is why we will continue to review these taxes from time to time, as we have been doing.",1,686,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00686
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second point, the burden of GST increase and how our system works, I think Mr Gerald Giam is saying, well, you want everyone to contribute, but, with GST, the low-income do not end up paying. Net-net, they do not have to pay. So, how do they contribute? But the point is this. With the GST, yes, they may get back something in terms of continuing offsets, but they do pay. There is a price. If there were no price to pay, we will not be having this debate. Everyone will happily say, ""GST goes up and there is no opposition to it"".",2,687,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00687
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But I think the Workers' Party and the PSP know that this is something not very popular on the ground and, therefore, they are objecting to it. But because people have to pay for it, then they feel that they are contributing to the system. Everyone contributes. With GST, we bring that about. It is a broad-based consumption tax which impacts everyone and everyone feels it, but it is also the way they can contribute and chip in to the system.",3,688,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00688
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But what we have done is do it in a fair way by offsetting the impact. And because the GST Vouchers are permanent, they are conjoined with our GST system. It is together, permanent. Therefore, we have confidence to say that, on a continuing basis, the charts that I have described, how we can offset the impact on the low-income groups. That is something we can do, not just today and not just five years, but on a continuing basis.",4,689,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00689

2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I thank the Finance Minister for his wrap-up speech. There are three clarifications. Before that, just a very short sort of response or preamble.",1,691,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00691
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I think the Minister talked about how much the personal income tax and property tax would have to rise to fill the hole if GST was not hiked. I want to clarify that when my colleague Assoc Prof Jamus Lim outlined different proposals for revenue generation, there was never the intent that the entire burden of plugging that hole falls onto personal income tax or property tax.",2,692,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00692
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"So, with respect, Sir, I think the view that we are putting forth proposals that soak the rich is a mischaracterisation. In fact, it is a caricaturisation of what we have put forward. The bulk of revenue generation in those proposals actually fell on the changes to the land sales, the changes to NIRC and also the net effect on corporate tax's take from compliance with the BEPS regime. Not a discretionary increase in corporate tax, but how that would impact the overall corporate tax taken. I think our point there is that —",3,693,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00693
2022-03-02-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leon Perera, if you can come to your clarifications and questions, please.",1,694,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00694
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Alright. Let me move to my first clarification, which is  I had an exchange with the hon Minister Lawrence Wong in this House in 2018. I asked the Minister at that time what would be a reasonable time interval when we review these rules governing the reserves. They were amended in 2008, they were amended again in 2015. So, what is reasonable time? Are we saying that it is set in stone and we will never amend it? And the hon Minister's reply to me at that time was, ""you never say never"" and these things do have to be reviewed at a certain point. So, my question is, what does the Minister think is a reasonable point in time when we review these rules, as we have suggested?",1,695,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00695
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second clarification is on the concept of an optimal level of reserves. I would invite the Minister to agree with me that as the absolute level of reserves increases in dollar terms as a proportion of GDP, we must accept that it is legitimate to bring into place policies that slow the growth of that reserve without depleting it. On that note, would it be the case that the Minister rejects altogether any notion that there is an optimal level of reserves and we keep adding to the reserves, ad infinitum, without any regard to the absolute level and its relation to GDP?",2,696,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00696
2022-03-02-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The last clarification is, the Minister alluded to the fact that when we make suggestions about the reserves, land sales, NIRC, there is a certain cavalier mindset involved in doing so. I would like to ask him, the PAP Government in this House did exactly that, in 2008 and they did it again in 2015. Was that cavalier? And if that was not cavalier, why is it cavalier when the Workers' Party now suggests doing that?",3,697,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00697
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, on the three points. On the first, I recognise that the Workers' Party's suggestions for revenue alternatives could entail mix and matches as they have highlighted, a bit from here, a bit from there. But I still say, as I have highlighted, the sums will not add up. Why? Basically, you are asking to tax more from three possible groups as an alternative to GST  the wealthy and the better-off, large companies and future generations. So, that is what it comes down to.",1,698,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00698
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The future generations would mean land sales and NIRC, these sorts of changes. And I have explained why we do not think it is financially prudent to make those changes.",2,699,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00699
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Large companies, I have highlighted. This is contingent on the evolving rules around BEPS 2.0 and, even if we were to get some additional revenue, we are very likely to have to reinvest back to strengthen our competitiveness.",3,700,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00700
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This leaves me with the third group – the wealthy. And that means wealth taxes, which, I have explained, can be difficult to do, or property tax or personal income tax. And, if you were to home in on property tax, I have explained, if you want to get another billion dollars of revenue from property tax, you probably would have to double property tax rates across the board.",4,701,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00701
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is just $1 billion. GST is $3.5 billion. So, where does the money come from? And that is why I highlighted the sums still do not add up.",5,702,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00702
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I appreciate and I take these in good faith that there are these different options that the Workers' Party has offered as alternatives. We have studied all of them before the Budget. During the Budget debate, when these options were raised, we went into them again with my team, but we still are not able to make the sums add up.",6,703,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00703
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The next two questions I will take them together – when is the next reasonable interval when we might review our reserves' rules and is there an optimal level of reserves? It is very hard to answer these questions, because I do not have a crystal ball. Really, who knows what will happen to the world in the next 30 years or more? Really. Can anybody predict? It is almost impossible.",7,704,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00704
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, what would trigger us to change? I think it will have to be something really very disruptive. Not just once off, but on a permanent basis, and we will have to study the options very, very carefully at that point in time. Because there are deep, deep implications if we were to change anything on the reserves' rules. Deep implications for intergenerational equity, essentially, resulting in our next generation having to pay more taxes, as I have said, and having less to deal with any emergencies in the future.",8,705,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00705
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is why I would say not something we will do today because we have other options. We have the GST, which we can implement in a fair way. We have other tax options.",9,706,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00706
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is the reason why I ask, well, I wonder, maybe this is taking it a little bit too lightly. Because why turn to the Reserves when we have all these options and why make the GST into the last resort? But reserves – okay. Future generations – never mind, let us do it. But GST – cannot touch.",10,707,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00707
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Why? Why take that approach? Especially when the way we have implemented the GST is not the way the Workers' Party has characterised it. It is not, and you know it, too. I have shown the charts. I have explained it. We have explained it before multiple times and we have reiterated our explanation.",11,708,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00708
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, if you understand this, then why are your proposals anything but GST increase? Even Reserves can be touched, but not GST increase. That part, honestly, I cannot understand. It makes me wonder why.",12,709,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00709
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Workers' Party cites that the GST will hurt the poor. It does not. I have explained it. And on that basis, they cannot support the Budget. Really? Do you know what you are saying then? You do not want to support all the things we have in this Budget? To uplift the wages of lower-income workers, Workfare, progressive wages, to help vulnerable families with KidSTART. You are rejecting all of that?",13,710,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00710
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I find it hard to understand, frankly, on the misguided view that GST hurts the poor, which it does not. I can only, therefore, ask whether you are taking things too lightly. Or whether you are raising opposition because of other reasons, political reasons? Or other things? As opposed to seriously looking at the facts and doing what is right for Singapore.",14,711,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00711
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The Workers' Party is entitled to their views and to not supporting the Budget.

2022-03-02-T-006,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Just now, the Minister for Finance responded to my question about the Budget cut.

2022-03-02-T-006,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Can I take it that the same reason applies? That it was not really a cut but was reallocated to new initiatives and that therefore this is a reallocation, not strictly a Budget cut? Do the new initiatives, therefore, include subsidies to F1 as well as the transfer to SPH Media Trust?",2,715,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00715
2022-03-02-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, yes, Ms Poa is right. When we talk about these Budget cuts, they are in the context of a budgetary framework that allows us to reduce – so, the cuts are real, mind you. The cuts are real and actually applied to Ministry expenditures. But Singapore also has new priorities. And, therefore, this allows us to reallocate expenditure from existing to new, without having to just top up more monies. In this way, we can moderate the increases in expenditures.",1,716,2022-03-02-T-006-S-00716

That is why, from this year onwards, every public officer will be able to use up to 40 hours a year to participate in developmental activities with the private, social and non-profit organisations. These opportunities can be made available by the Public Service Division and other agencies, or self-sourced opportunities, as long as the activities are developmental and do not lead to any conflict of interests.",19,931,2022-03-02-T-009-S-00931
2022-03-02-T-009,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"On Mr Leong Mun Wai's point to streamline the Government organisations, perhaps, I would like to let Mr Leong Mun Wai know that, indeed, we have already done many of the things that he suggested. Where it is logical, we bring services and facilities together. Good examples of this include the Heartbeat@Bedok and Our Tampines Hub. Where it is logical and saves us money and resources, we bring different agencies under one roof so that we can save money for our country and save manpower.",20,932,2022-03-02-T-009-S-00932
2022-03-02-T-009,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"On the other hand, we also have an asset-light model.

2022-03-02-T-009,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"But a more important point that Mr Leong Mun Wai asked is  what is the purpose of the People's Association (PA)? The role of the PA is to help us build up our social capital in peacetime. It serves the government of the day. For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, where did we get the extra capacity to reach out to do our vaccination operations, to distribute the masks, to distribute the sanitisers? Where did we get the people to go and reach out to the people who are in isolation in their homes? We did not depend just on the PA staff. There are only about 2,000 PA staff but there are many volunteers that we mobilised to come together. Without these capabilities and capacities, I am not sure that we will be able to achieve the various things that we have been able to achieve during our crisis operations to manage the ongoing COVID-19 situation.",22,934,2022-03-02-T-009-S-00934
2022-03-02-T-009,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"So, for these two years, what we have built up, assiduously, over peacetime – these social bonds, this trust, this deep network – to help our people and reach out, have been invaluable to Singapore. And that is not something that many other countries have because perhaps, many other countries take it for granted that the social bonds will be there.",23,935,2022-03-02-T-009-S-00935

Why is ECDA an agency that is reporting to both MOE and MSF? Because ECDA performs the role of taking care of the preschool children with both the education component by MOE and the care component by MSF. This is how we flexibly configure our organisations in order to meet the needs of our people.

We will constantly check our blind spots, take in the best ideas from within this Chamber, from the Public Service itself and from people and organisations beyond the Public Service.

If it is merely to work or to provide services without being physically here, actually, for Singapore, that is already happening and there are no impediments. If it is to enter Singapore freely, for example, not to have the same kind of restrictions for visas and so on, again, Singapore's openness makes it quite questionable what this e-residency confers in terms of additional benefits. If it is then to offer access to things like healthcare or other services that residents enjoy, we have to ask the question what obligations the e-residents should be expected to fulfil. Are the potential e-residents asking to pay taxes in Singapore? Are the e-residents saying that they agree to be bound by Singapore's laws? And in any case, if they are not in Singapore, how would those obligations be enforceable? That is from the e-resident's perspective.",3,946,2022-03-02-T-009-S-00946

Of course, for Singapore-based companies, one could make the argument that they can access the talents, a much wider pool, which they can already today. Then, having allowed these e-residents to earn income from Singapore and yet the e-residents will not have the opportunity to consume in Singapore, the benefits become much more questionable.",4,947,2022-03-02-T-009-S-00947

I agree with the Minister, I hope that employers can be more supportive. But I think we know, from the NUS study, this is not happening on the ground.

I wish to clarify that this is only an assumption made for the purpose of simplifying the illustration of the revenue stream. Varying land sales each year would result in a varying revenue stream but would, in no way, invalidate the model.

This is because the revenue for each year is the accumulation of land sales over many years in the past and the latest year's land sale would have a small impact on the revenue. For example, suppose Year 10 is a recessionary year and land sale is only $50 instead of $100, then revenue generated from the land sale in Year 10 is $2.50 instead of $5. However, revenue from previous years' land sales remains unchanged so that the total revenue for the year is $47.5 instead of $50. A 50% drop in land sale proceeds results in only a 5% drop in revenue because it is cushioned by the land sales in earlier years. Conversely, any attempt to sell more land in any particular year would also have limited impact on the revenue for the year since it is spread out over many years. It is, therefore, a rather stable revenue stream.",4,986,2022-03-02-T-010-S-00986

2022-03-02-T-010,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, with regard to the procurement strategy for infrastructure, how does the Ministry plan to continue to ensure spending on infrastructure projects is value for money and optimised on a life-cycle basis? For example, one aspect that could be looked at is spending on better materials which will ensure better quality and longer lasting infrastructure; and technologies which will ensure better maintenance productivity, allowing workers to focus on higher value works. These workers can be retrained in new skillsets that lead to higher productivity and wages. The initial capital outlay may be higher, but the lower operating cost can compensate for that.",2,1005,2022-03-02-T-010-S-01005

Before the Government embarks on a project, MOF reviews the project objectives and business case. For example, at the initial stage, we examine the cost-benefit analysis and consider synergies across projects or other opportunities to optimise resources. As the plans develop, MOF works with the development agencies to determine the development approach, design and risk, and use evaluation tools, such as life cycle costing, to optimise costs across the infrastructure lifespan.",9,1026,2022-03-02-T-010-S-01026

But as I have said, we do not just focus on reducing upfront construction costs. By working with agencies on design optimisation and system choices, we seek to reduce total life-cycle costs, which include downstream operating costs. As an example, for the Cross Island Line (CRL), LTA is using a different traction power supply system that enables more efficient power transmission. This reduces total energy usage and the number of substations required. This is expected to result in life-cycle cost savings of about $280 million.",11,1028,2022-03-02-T-010-S-01028

Government assistance is prioritised for families with less means and in greater need of social support. In means-testing for our social schemes, housing type is one of the proxies we use to estimate an individual’s means. We also look at other factors, such as income and number of members in the household. A person living in a higher value property or larger housing type is, in general, more likely to have access to resources or support through the family. Where there are exceptional circumstances, I encourage our Members of Parliament and community leaders to bring these cases to the attention of the relevant agencies so that their circumstances can be holistically assessed.

With the threat of climate change, water resilience is more important than ever. The WCT reflects the fact that water is precious and encourages every individual and business to play a role in conserving our water resources. The water tariff and WCT together form the final price of water, reflecting the economic cost of producing water from our desalination and NEWater plants. GST is then levied on this final price, inclusive of taxes and duties that are related to the supply of goods or services. This approach is consistent with the practice in other jurisdictions, such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand.",52,1069,2022-03-02-T-010-S-01069

The first point I would make is that the amount is low. But, more importantly, with the U-Save rebates and vouchers that have been given, these households will, actually, be able to cover their utilities bills. So, they need not worry and Mr Faisal Manap should reassure his residents that, with the U-Save rebates that are given from the Government, they will be well taken care of by this Government. In fact, when you add the U-Save rebates from the Household Support Package together with the Assurance Package, it will come up to about eight to 10 months' worth of utilities bills, and this is not taking into account the permanent GST Voucher scheme, which also has a U-Save component.",54,1071,2022-03-02-T-010-S-01071

Fundamentally, our approach is this  land is a national asset, think of it as an endowment. In its physical form, it is an asset, it has a value. If you sell it, it gets converted into cash, but we put it back into the reserves. Some of it comes back in the form of the NIRC.

In the past week, we have witnessed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the largest war on the European continent since World War II. The signs of this conflict had been brewing for a long time.

The US-China rivalry has continued to intensify and we see that this is increasingly playing out in both countries' regulations in the trade and technology domains. We have also seen stronger rhetoric and action over Taiwan and this seems to be an increasingly likely catalyst if a conflict, intended or otherwise, were to break out between the two powers.",5,1121,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01121

As a result, there is a discernible shift in the global centre of gravity and extra-regional countries are increasingly turning their attention here. This includes the European Union countries like the UK, France and Germany. In one view, this is a good thing as the more invested countries are in this region, the more likely they will play a role in balancing the powers in this region.",6,1122,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01122

2022-03-02-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Chairman, the rise of China and the evolving geopolitical situation between China and the US had a global impact, especially on Singapore. When US President Richard Nixon visited China 50 years ago in 1972, the US was a superpower while China was seen as the sick man of Asia. In terms of nominal GDP, the size of China's economy in 1972 was just 8.9% of the US economy. But in 2020, China's economy became 70.3% of the US economy. It is projected that China's economy will overtake the US economy by 2030. The rivalry between the two countries has given rise to stiff competition in technology, innovation and defence build-up. As a result, Quad and AUKUS were formed to counter the influence of China. Many ASEAN countries, including Singapore, have been asked to take sides. We are being swept up in this current of geopolitical change.",1,1183,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01183

The related crises arising from climate change have deep implications for international peace and stability. Singapore is one of the more vulnerable nations due to the rising sea level. We are already experiencing erratic weather patterns which wreak havoc with sudden downpours causing flooding. Changes in weather patterns are also affecting food supplies – a frightening prospect, as we rely heavily on imported food; exporting nations will prioritise their own nations’ needs first.",1,1198,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01198

2022-03-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mr Chairman, I state the obvious when I say that battling COVID-19 has been the central preoccupation of governments and their citizens all over the world in the last two years, including Singapore. If we think about it, very few events have that power and reach. In recent history, I think World War II did, and that shared experience had defined that affected generation. If you compare, COVID-19 is not as devastating as World War II, but many years on, I suspect that it will likely linger in the memories of all those who have lived through it.",2,1203,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01203

My Ministry and SAF have remained very focused on the security environment even as we went into the trenches to join the whole-of-Government in our fight against COVID-19.",3,1204,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01204
2022-03-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The SAF’s core purpose, first and foremost, must remain to protect Singapore from all potential external aggressors. Mr Vikram Nair alluded to this, Mr Dennis Tan, too. And because we are a small country, with less space figuratively and literally to react, we need to recognise these threats early. For Singapore’s survival and well-being, the SAF not only needs to be always prepared, to plan long term and be well-organised, but also nimble to change, if we are to prevent or ward off imminent danger.",4,1205,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01205
2022-03-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Therefore, despite our efforts to fight COVID-19, MINDEF and SAF have continued to plan in earnest so that we build the next generation SAF that is not only capable of meeting today’s security threats, but anticipating tomorrow’s, too. And I think that must be our approach. There will always be the unexpected threats, just like COVID-19. But the better the SAF is structured to deal with the known threats, the more bandwidth it has to deal with the unknown unknowns. I will deal with some of these initiatives later on, which Members have asked for.",5,1206,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01206

2022-03-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"This year, my Ministry will increase our spending relative to the past two years. Mr Shawn Huang asked about this. That increase is due to the resumption of projects, training and exercises which were disrupted by COVID-19 over the past two years. I should underscore that we continued to purchase and acquire new platforms despite COVID-19. But suppliers were also affected, causing delays. For example, deliveries of RSAF’s H225M Medium Lift and CH-47F Heavy Lift helicopters were delayed from end-2020 to March and May 2021, respectively. The delivery of our Invincible-class submarines, initially planned for last year, has also been delayed.

SAF expects to increase numbers of training, both locally and overseas, to reach pre-COVID-19 levels later this year. Last year, we, indeed, had fewer overseas exercises and with fewer troops. For example, Exercise Forging Sabre in the US, with 800 personnel, Exercise Wallaby in Australia with around 580 personnel, much fewer than pre-COVID-19 levels. At home, NS training has progressively returned to normalcy and in-camp training call-up rates are on track to reach pre-COVID-19 levels this year.",8,1209,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01209

This translates to an increase of 6.5%, which is expected to be one-off and a catch-up for the reduced spending for FYs 2020 and 2021. COVID-19 resulted in sharp dips and spikes but, over the next five years, MINDEF's budget is expected to keep pace with inflation, or 3% to 4% nominal growth each year, which I have assured this House previously.",9,1210,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01210

Members have asked about this – Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Dennis Tan. Indeed, SAF was able to operate at a high level of readiness and conduct critical operations amidst the pandemic. Soldiers within units were disciplined and kept to strict health and safety protocols, such as health screening for all recruits and instructors, training in smaller groups where possible, temperature taking, testing, and testing returning NSmen from their In-Camp Trainings (ICTs) every seven days.",10,1211,2022-03-02-T-011-S-01211

They are our key fighting platforms for maritime strike, anti-air and anti-submarine warfare, but the midlife upgrade, as we do for all platforms, will be more than just addition and alterations, if I can use the construction term.
