2022-03-03-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. What is the infection rate of children under five years old in Singapore? There is a new study that suggests that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is less effective for children. Is the Ministry looking into other vaccines like the one by Johnson & Johnson or non-mRNA vaccines like the ones by Sinovac or Novavax, for approval for use in children below five? What more should parents of children below five years old do to prevent them from getting COVID-19, since there is currently no vaccination?",1,5,2022-03-03-T-001-S-00005
2022-03-03-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the Member asked three questions. For the first, the specific data is a slightly different issue from the Parliamentary Question (PQ) he had filed. I suggest he file a PQ, potentially a written PQ, for that data. We will get it to him.",1,6,2022-03-03-T-001-S-00006

2022-03-03-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a quick question for the Senior Minister of State. This is with regard to the study that was being referred to by hon Member Mr Yip Hon Weng. Has that changed the consideration of the Expert Committee and the Ministry as to the effectiveness of vaccination amongst children, especially those from five to 12? How is the Ministry responding to that study? Is the Ministry undertaking its own independent study in Singapore as to the effectiveness of the vaccine for children above the age of 12?",1,10,2022-03-03-T-001-S-00010
2022-03-03-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. The issue is not whether a vaccine is or is not effective. There is a matter of timing of those and the circumstances. So, the matter continues to be studied by various people around the world, as well as our experts here.",1,11,2022-03-03-T-001-S-00011
2022-03-03-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"For children in the age groups that the Member mentioned, where the vaccines are already being rolled out, indeed, we continue through our various public health processes, to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the vaccination process.",2,12,2022-03-03-T-001-S-00012
2022-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how regularly does the Ministry conduct reviews on the necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry; (b) what are the metrics that the Ministry considers when making this regular determination that TraceTogether and SafeEntry are still necessary; and (c) whether the Ministry (i) quantifies the impact of the compliance burden on business owners, the effect on productivity and electricity consumption in general in enforcing these requirements and (ii) takes into account this burden in the metrics.",1,13,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00013
2022-03-03-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"Sir, as we have described in previous responses to Parliamentary Questions, TraceTogether and SafeEntry continue to play important roles in our pandemic response system. TraceTogether and SafeEntry enable verification checks into venues or activities where vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) are in force. This is necessary to protect unvaccinated persons who remain at higher risk of severe disease.",1,14,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00014

2022-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. Just one supplementary question. Given that the compliance burden for TraceTogether and SafeEntry is not insignificant – it impacts time, productivity and so on – what would be the criterion or criteria that the Ministry would use to make the decision to phase it out? At what point will that actually happen?",1,17,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00017
2022-03-03-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I thank the Member for his questions. Indeed, measures that affect public health and safety do have a compliance burden. This is not unique to TraceTogether and SafeEntry. Neither is it unique to the COVID-19 situation. If we look at, for example, the automobile industry, the use of seat belts is a cost burden, but we do it now after many decades of education because it has proven its worth.",1,18,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00018
2022-03-03-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, really, the issue is whether or not the approach that we are taking has proven its worth. I hope the Member will agree that it has the ability to issue Health Risk Warnings and Notices very quickly in the face of a rapidly progressing pandemic; is an important public health measure. These have managed to keep our case fatality rate low as we have slowed the spread and allowed people to self-isolate and seek help very early on in the illness. As long as we are able to do that and to demonstrate an effectiveness of using TraceTogether, SafeEntry and VDS in our public health response, then I hope the Member will agree that the ability to save lives, prevent morbidity and mortality through this disease is a beneficial outcome and is worth paying that compliance cost and compliance burden for.",2,19,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00019
2022-03-03-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Studies in other parts of the world, there was a UK study that was published looking at this, looking at some modelling and the extent to which this automated contact tracing approach saves lives, prevents cases, and we have every reason to believe the same is true here in Singapore.",3,20,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00020
2022-03-03-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The study that was done in the UK. If we extrapolate that approach to our situation here, the estimate is that between September 2021 and January 2022, comparing similar data-sets over about those four, five months, the contact tracing approach that we have taken in Singapore may have saved about 290 deaths and slowed down the progression to avoid about 144,000 cases. I hope the Member would agree that these are useful outcomes.",4,21,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00021
2022-03-03-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"When will we no longer need such an approach, when will we phase out and what may the criteria be, it is a bit too early to tell. We need to wait until we no longer need VDS, we need to wait until we are quite sure that the pandemic and COVID-19 is no longer epidemic but is endemic. We have not reached that point yet. It is very hard to say with some degree of certainty what that date will be. But I think we have explained before that as long as we need the measures in place – the public health measures, the VDS – then, today, the easiest way and the least burdensome way and the cheapest way for businesses, for us to roll out these measures, is to continue with the TraceTogether and SafeEntry systems that we have in place, rather than standing up a whole new system and a whole new infrastructure in order to get those outcomes. So, when we no longer need those measures, then we would stand down the systems.",5,22,2022-03-03-T-002-S-00022
2022-03-03-T-003,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Prime Minister given that special arrangements were made during the 2020 General Election for those on Stay-Home Notice at designated facilities to vote at these facilities away from other voters (a) whether the Government has any plans to provide similar arrangements for other groups of voters at future elections; and (b) whether the Government will also consider mail-in voting for Singaporeans who are overseas.,1,23,2022-03-03-T-003-S-00023

First, the electorate is ageing rapidly  21% of Singapore Citizens in the Registers of Electors were aged 65 and above in GE2020, from 14% in GE2011. Second, from time to time, travel difficulties, such as in this pandemic, would make it difficult for Singaporeans working, studying or living overseas, to vote. In spite of the challenges of the pandemic, 6,500 overseas citizens registered to vote in GE2020, from just 3,500 in GE2011. We recognise that many overseas Singaporeans remain engaged with Singapore and are keen to exercise their vote.",2,25,2022-03-03-T-003-S-00025
2022-03-03-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"As the Member noted, the Elections Department, or ELD, made a special arrangement at GE2020 to allow voters serving Stay-Home Notice at designated hotels to cast their votes. ELD is looking at piloting this arrangement for voters residing at some nursing homes. With this in place, there will no longer be a need for nursing homes to bring their elderly voters staying with them to the polling stations to vote.",3,26,2022-03-03-T-003-S-00026
2022-03-03-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"For overseas Singaporeans, ELD had established overseas polling stations for them to cast their vote. This is because voting by paper ballot at polling stations remains the most transparent and secure method of voting that best ensures the integrity of the voting process and secrecy of votes. However, ELD recognises that it may not be possible for various reasons, for some overseas Singaporeans to travel to these overseas polling stations to vote. ELD is thus studying if we can introduce postal voting and allow overseas Singaporeans to mail in their votes.",4,27,2022-03-03-T-003-S-00027

These hubs are conveniently located at community centres and public libraries, and seniors can walk-in to any of these hubs for one-on-one sessions with a Digital Ambassador. In addition to CSA’s SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme, my Ministry also engages seniors on digital skills through other platforms, such as e-getai and dialect drama series, and IMDA’s SG Digital Office and NLB’s SURE programmes. For example, IMDA's SG Digital Office has reached out to more than 130,000 seniors and the curriculum and the types of interactions can certainly include cyber hygiene practices.",2,31,2022-03-03-T-004-S-00031

Later this year, MINDEF will introduce an automated system which draws on income-related information from CPF Board and IRAS to compute the Make-Up Pay amounts. NSmen and their employers will be provided the opportunity to review the computed amounts to see if they agree. If no objections are raised, the amount will then be paid out to them automatically. For the bulk of NSmen and their employers, this greatly simplifies the process and saves time. Those who believe that the computed amounts are not up-to-date can certainly submit additional information for recalculation, so that the right amounts are paid out.",18,186,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00186

Our National Servicemen perform several transactions with MINDEF/SAF throughout their NS journey. The idea is to centralise these transactions and essential NS services onto the OneNS platform and render it more accessible via a single mobile application or a revamped web portal. For a start, NSmen can look forward to enhanced Call-Up and Deferment eServices, to facilitate preparation for ICT. Other eServices will be rolled out subsequently and progressively.",21,189,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00189
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"MINDEF has also collaborated with the Smart Nation Digital Government Group to digitally deliver NS recognition benefits to our National Servicemen. Since November last year, MINDEF has been disbursing the NS Excellence Awards and Celebratory Gifts in the form of e-credits that can be accessed via LifeSG. In the past, recipients received their benefits in the form of physical vouchers. With this change, they are now able to receive and redeem these credits conveniently via the use of their mobile devices. The credits can be used at both online and brick-and-mortar shops that accept payment by PayNow QR. Thus far, through surveys, we found that 97% of surveyed users had reported satisfaction with this improvement. Come April this year, servicemen will also be able to use their credits with merchants that accept NETS QR. With this change, an even broader range of merchants will be able to benefit, including those who operate in heartland shops and hawkers. Obviously, with this greater array of merchants and merchandise, it will also be a value-add to our NSmen.",22,190,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00190
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"MINDEF will move our other cash and voucher-based recognition schemes, such as the cash payments for NS HOME, onto LifeSG. By mid-2022, MINDEF and MHA will disburse NS recognition benefits to 100,000 National Servicemen via LifeSG every year. Quite apart from the convenience that this will bring to our NSmen, this will also greatly contribute to our national drive to foster e-payments adoption and to go green and paperless.",23,191,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00191
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Our National Servicemen who have received NS recognition benefits via the LifeSG mobile application will receive SMS notifications that these credits have gone into their account. We are very conscious that, in sending out these SMS notifications, these should not be mistaken as scams, and we will ensure that our SMSes will have no clickable links.",24,192,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00192
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"This brings me to the third thrust of the NSRC’s work, which is that of enhancing recognition and support for our National Servicemen. Our National Servicemen contribute to defence during their two years of National Service and at every subsequent In-Camp Training. There is sacrifice, from both them, as well as, we hear from Members, through the support of their families as well. We appreciate this greatly. Miss Rachel Ong asked about our recognition initiatives for our National Servicemen.",25,193,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00193
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"As mentioned by the Minister for Defence, we will enhance the NS HOME awards to better express our appreciation to our National Servicemen and their loved ones. We will disburse an additional $2,000 in cash to each National Servicemen cumulatively across the three existing NS HOME milestones, comprising $1,000 in cash at the first milestone and $500 in cash each, at the second and third milestones. Our National Servicemen will now receive at least $6,000 at the end of their full-time National Service and at least $5,500 at the mid-point and at the completion of their ORNS journey.",26,194,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00194

This complements the current NS HOME payment, of which the bulk is disbursed into the National Servicemen’s CPF accounts for long-term financial needs. As I have explained earlier, these credits can be used at merchants ranging from those that operate on e-commerce platforms to brick-and-mortar shops as well.",27,195,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00195

2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Beyond recognition, we also want to provide our servicemen and their families with peace of mind when they participate in NS activities. Since 2016, MINDEF and MHA have been purchasing Group Term Life and Group Personal Accident core insurance coverage for all MINDEF and MHA servicemen, for a sum assured of $150,000 each. We have reviewed this and, come 2023, we will increase the coverage to $300,000 each.

2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"I shall now move on to speak about another topic which is critical – training safety. As we continue to enhance the NS system, our safety practices on the ground must also continue to be robust. The SAF, therefore, places a very strong emphasis on strengthening our safety culture through regular audits and inspections, by leveraging technology and constantly reminding both commanders and men of the importance to internalise the safety culture itself – look after yourself, look after one another.",32,200,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00200
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Dr Wan Rizal asked about the third External Review Panel on SAF Safety, or ERPSS, which MINDEF/SAF started last year. The Panel was established to review the SAF’s safety management systems and to make recommendations to improve safety in the SAF. A positive observation made by the Panel was the continual enhancements to the Safety Management System at our Basic Military Training Centre, or BMTC, where a slew of safety and mental health support measures has been implemented to better help recruits transit from civilian life into military life.",33,201,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00201
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),The Panel also noted the efforts to scaffold safety training across the leadership schools to ensure that our commanders understand and will conduct training safely.

2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Aside from the ERPSS, we have, internally, the SAF Inspector-General’s Office. The SAF Inspector-General’s Office has commenced its second two-year audit cycle of all SAF formations. Mr Don Wee asked about this. Compared to the first audit cycle, commanders and servicemen were observed to have taken even more ownership in upholding safety practices and displayed more awareness towards potential safety hazards.",35,203,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00203
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Going forward, the SAF will continue to sustain our emphasis on safety policies and processes and to ensure that safety lessons will be passed on, even as we see the turnover of servicemen, because it is in the nature of our NS system that you have cohorts who come in and train and they may leave. But we must ensure that the safety culture is entrenched and it is practised and improved upon, and we will do so.",36,204,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00204
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Dr Wan Rizal also asked how MINDEF harnesses technology and digitalisation to further strengthen training safety. We are developing an enterprise Safety Information System for commanders to disseminate information on safety trends and lessons across the SAF. This would provide better awareness of safety situations and make safety promotion more targeted and, therefore, reduce the risk and likelihood of incidents recurring elsewhere within the SAF that are similar to the original occurrence.",37,205,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00205
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"However, as I have said, safety is not just the responsibility of commanders. Every soldier must play his role, too. The SafeGuardian mobile application, which I spoke about at Committee of Supply (COS) 2020, has played a significant role in enabling our servicemen to report safety hazards and near misses in a timely manner. Since its roll-out to our active Servicemen in June last year, we have seen a 20% increase in open reports being filed.",38,206,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00206
2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"The SafeGuardian mobile application has empowered our servicemen to take greater ownership of their own safety and the safety of those around them.

2022-03-03-T-010,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about other recent efforts to enhance training safety. MINDEF/SAF will be collaborating with DSO and the National University of Singapore to establish the Heat Resilience and Performance Centre in the middle of this year. We recognise that rising ambient temperatures due to climate change will increasingly impact the well-being of our servicemen and the effectiveness of our training and operations.,40,208,2022-03-03-T-010-S-00208

He conducted household visits as part of the Home Vaccination Programme, ensuring that Singaporeans who were immobile and immunocompromised could receive their vaccinations.

Throughout the pandemic, fear-mongers have spread falsehoods about variants and the ill-effects of vaccines, which have directly threatened public health and, if not, weakened trust.

Some found it too abstract, prescriptive and focused on present-day threats at the expense of emerging challenges, while some others did not want to be told what Total Defence was about.

But all my interlocutors in America have said they cannot do it because of domestic political reasons. In a sense, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is an alternative which they are trying to put beef on this framework. Let us see and let us encourage them. But as I have said, the key point I keep making and, in fact, the Prime Minister has made to multiple Presidents in Asia, trade is strategy. So, let us watch how progress is made on this front.

The rise of protectionism amidst COVID-19 has also underscored the importance of  one, upholding a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system, as embodied by the WTO; second, deepening economic integration at multilateral fora, such as APEC and G20; third, diversifying trade relations through regional arrangements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and our latest free trade agreement, the Pacific Alliance-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.

Malaysia is our closest neighbour and bilateral engagements continued both formally and informally throughout this pandemic. Our Ministers have been communicating  WhatsApp, letters, phone calls, video calls. And most importantly, at times of greatest need, we are available for each other.

The West Bank is governed by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and controlled by the Fatah Party, while Hamas seized unilateral control of Gaza in 2007. This political divide has persisted despite past attempts at forging a national unity government.

Under this unique bilateral arrangement, Singapore residents can make urgent trips to Malaysia to visit immediate family members who are critically ill, or to pay their last respects, without serving the full quarantine duration in Malaysia. Malaysia residents can similarly use the DCEV scheme to visit immediate family members in Singapore for similar reasons.

Several examples, some of which I have gleaned from the CAD's Annual Report 2020/21, include the fraudulent billion-dollar investment scheme by nickel trading companies; trade financing fraud involving several oil trading companies that has left banks with a combined exposure reported to be about US$3.5 billion; and numerous cases of misconduct in the stock markets.

People convicted of serious white-collar crimes are imposed deterrent sentences. But why do these crimes worth several billion dollars still happen with some regularity on our shores?",7,537,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00537

What we see in the open is not robbery but a legitimate front. The real underbelly can only be exposed through insiders. Insiders are not likely to volunteer information unless their interests are protected. I know this is a separate matter from providing incentives but, in a risk-benefit calculus, the benefit may not be just mere protection. We are incentivised by way of rewards, too.",11,541,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00541
2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Another suggestion I have is to review the role of external auditors in order that they are in a better position to detect fraud in companies and report the matter to CAD. Hon Members may be familiar with the German Parliament’s investigation into the shortcomings of the Wirecard’s auditors. By the way, the CAD has investigated Wirecard, too, which involves alleged losses of more than €1 billion and prosecution in Singapore is currently afoot. The report concluded that the auditor did not maintain sufficient professional scepticism and this led to it accepting documents and instructions without sufficient scrutiny. There must be better alignment between the auditor’s role currently and the investing public’s expectations.",12,542,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00542
2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, we need to decisively tackle the problem of resourcing. I suggest we beef up manpower internally and be more open to engaging other experts from the outside. CAD is operating in a challenging environment on a day-to-day basis. Despite that, it is doing a very good job in bringing offenders of complex white-collar crimes to book. As legislators, we need to ensure that CAD is sufficiently resourced so that investigations into complex white-collar crime are conducted fully and with due dispatch. The faster the culprits are prosecuted, the stronger the message of deterrence will be against like-minded offenders in the future.",13,543,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00543

2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I now move on to the second point of my speech, which deals with the death penalty. The Government's position was spelt out by the hon Minister on 5 October 2020. He said that in determining whether to apply the death penalty to a particular offence, the Government takes into account three considerations in totality  seriousness of the offence; how widespread the offence is; and the need for deterrence. Applying these considerations, the main offences for which the mandatory death penalty is imposed are intentional murder, gang robbery with murder, trafficking of significant quantities of drugs, terrorist bombing and use of firearms. The Government’s approach has resulted in Singapore being one of the safest places in the world – something that is deeply valued by Singaporeans.",15,545,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00545
2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Two significant changes to the law had happened since 2013. Drug couriers convicted of capital drug trafficking offences who have been issued with certificates of substantial assistance to curtail drug trafficking activities or found to be suffering from abnormality of mind would be imposed with life sentences instead of the mandatory death penalty. In addition, the death penalty would only be imposed as a mandatory sentence for intentional murder. For the other forms of murder, the Court has a discretion to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment.",16,546,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00546
2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The Minister had revealed earlier last month that for the period between 1 January 2013 and 11 February 2022, out of 104 accused persons who were found to be couriers and convicted as drug traffickers, 82 of them received certificates of substantial assistance and they were imposed with life imprisonment terms. Of the remaining 22, eight persons were imposed with life imprisonment on the basis that they were suffering from an abnormality of mind. The Court imposed the death penalty on 14 persons. In other words, 13% were found to be couriers and convicted of capital drug trafficking charges were imposed with mandatory death penalties.",17,547,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00547
2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The impact of the law is clear. The number of persons subjected to the mandatory death sentence has been reduced significantly. Nonetheless, there could be a watering down of the deterrent effect of the death penalty for drug trafficking. I, therefore, ask whether there has been any deterioration on the part of the Home Team’s ability to keep our drug situation under check. If there is no deterioration, may I ask whether the Government is prepared to consider extending the issuance of certificates of substantial assistance to cover cases where drug couriers whose death penalties have been affirmed on appeal?",18,548,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00548
2022-03-03-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Most essentially, Singaporeans must continue to be convinced that the retention of the death penalty is essential for the Home Team to do its job. The fact that most Singaporeans agreed in the past does not mean that their views may not change. Outside Singapore, more and more jurisdictions have abolished the death penalty. Singaporeans’ opinions can be shaped by these developments.",19,549,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00549

2022-03-03-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mdm Chairperson, the death penalty has been a part of Singapore’s criminal justice system from colonial times. Capital punishment is not new or unique. It has been a part of criminal justice systems for thousands of years and references to it can be found in the Code of Hammurabi in Babylon more than 3,000 years ago. It is usually reserved for the most serious of offences.",1,554,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00554
2022-03-03-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Over the last 50 to 60 years though, a number of countries, including most of Europe, have abolished the death penalty. There are various groups lobbying for its abolition in many parts of the world, including in Singapore. This is usually based on humanitarian grounds because, despite the seriousness of the crime involved, when one looks at the world from the perspective of the offender, there is usually a sad story involved as well.",2,555,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00555
2022-03-03-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In Singapore, the death penalty is used only for a very small number of offences, including for murder, kidnapping, illegal use of firearms and drugs. Of these, the largest number of death sentences are meted out for drug trafficking. Singapore has done well in keeping these serious crimes under control. Our rates of murder, kidnapping and firearm use are extremely low, with the latter two offences being very rare.",3,556,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00556
2022-03-03-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"While drug-related offences are more widespread, in relative terms, compared to other countries, Singapore’s rate of drug addiction and drug-related crimes is amongst the lowest in the world. That drug trafficking is more rampant than the other serious crimes is not surprising because there are well-financed organised syndicates running this business.",4,557,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00557

With 75% of young drug abuse arrests being first-time drug abusers and the number of repeat young drug abusers doubling over the last couple of years, there is a distressingly liberal attitude among young people today towards drugs and other such substances. There is a much more curious attitude towards drugs, such as cannabis, and procuring e-cigarettes to vape. Despite the stringent regulation and monitoring and much success in eliminating drugs in our nation, many young people are still able to seek out suppliers via messaging platforms and obtain drugs and drug paraphernalia. While part of the battle is to keep pace and cut off the source of drugs, what initiatives will MHA be deploying to nip the problem in the bud to prevent a drug-tolerant culture from taking root in Singapore?",1,656,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00656

2022-03-03-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"With Telegram groups often being used to illegally advertise and supply such prohibited items, the threat has evolved because of increased internet penetration and the abundance of mobile apps that allow for encrypted communications.

Often, those who are detained for plotting a terror attack or collaborating with overseas units to design a terror attack are misguided in their thinking and philosophy. Detaining them so as to prevent them from carrying out the act is key, but, of equal importance, is the effort to rehabilitate them such that they form their own view that violent, extreme, radical thinking manifesting in terror-plotting against the innocent is just simply incorrect. How does MHA intend to intensify its efforts in such rehabilitation and how successful has MHA been so far in rehabilitating potential terrorist threats?",1,701,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00701

That includes how the public can contact the various departments and Statutory Boards to provide feedback or raise queries and concerns or seek help. That also includes the day-to-day service to the community to protect them from the myriad of potential threats.

The number of firearms offences immediately fell by 39% in 1974 to 106 cases and continued to decline in subsequent years, ever lower. Firearms offences remain very rare today in Singapore. So, that is a historical perspective and the charts speak for themselves.",2,763,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00763
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me talk about the current situation. I could go on a little bit about it, but let me just deal with a few short points. It appears to us, specifically in relation to drugs, that our position on drugs, including imposing the DP is well known in some of our neighbouring regions and that has contributed to a strong deterrent effect.",3,764,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00764
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"MHA specifically commissioned a study on persons from parts of the region outside Singapore. These are places from where most of our arrested drug traffickers have come from in recent years. We wanted to get a sense of what people in these places knew and thought. And this is what we found  82% of respondents believed that DP makes people not to want to commit serious crimes in Singapore. These are not Singaporeans, these are people in the region – 69% believed that the DP is more effective in discouraging people from committing serious crimes, compared to life imprisonment.",4,765,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00765

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I emphasise this – these are the places from which many of our traffickers come from. You remove the death penalty, that number, 83%, will surely be reduced because there is money to be made. Just go back to the second question, 69% believe that DP is more effective than life imprisonment. It is a fair assumption to say that more people will traffic drugs into Singapore, more drugs will enter into Singapore, there will be more drug abusers in Singapore and more Singaporean families and individuals will be harmed, if we remove the DP, in particular, the mandatory death penalty (MDP).",6,767,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00767

In 1990, the Government introduced the MDP for trafficking in more than 1.2 kilogrammes of opium. Comparing the four years before and after, there was a 66% reduction in the average net weight trafficked. In a 2018 study conducted by MHA, we found a very high level of awareness of the DP amongst convicted drug traffickers.",9,770,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00770

One of the traffickers in this study said the following  he knew very clearly that if he were caught for trafficking a small amount, he would just go to jail for trafficking. But if he was caught with a larger amount, he would be at risk of the death penalty. And so he trafficked below the threshold amount.",10,771,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00771

That is my third point, the majority of Singapore residents support the use of the DP and agree that the DP deters serious crimes. In 2019, our MHA survey showed very strong support for the DP. We conducted a follow-up survey in 2021, with a segment specifically on MDP. The results are still being analysed. So, my statements on that are preliminary.",11,772,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00772

Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked how Singapore compared with countries that did not have DP for drug offences. Well, let me answer it in a broader way.

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second aspect is working with the family. Strong family support is essential in the rehabilitation and re-integration journey. Prisons conducts programmes, social skills training programme and the Family Reintegration Programme (FRP). The aim is to help the inmates link up, bond with their family, strengthen the bonds with their family and loved ones.",19,813,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00813

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Some families may also face difficulties during the inmates’ incarceration. Prisons proactively refers families of inmates who require assistance to Family Service Centres. In the broader community, grassroots volunteers are roped in to support families impacted by incarceration. Today, there are over 1,200 grassroots volunteers under the Yellow Ribbon Community Project, involving all 93 divisions across Singapore.",21,815,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00815
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Third is the Skills Training and Employment Assistance. This is a key focus. Having a stable job upon release reduces the risk of re-offending.,22,816,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00816
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Mark Chay asked about the success of the Train and Place (TAP) and Grow Initiative. The TAP and Grow initiative works on equipping inmates with skills to secure and sustain jobs. He also asked if there are plans to expand this initiative. The Prison School deals with inmates. They can go for academic programmes while in prison. Programmes range from GCE to diploma and degree programmes.,23,817,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00817
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Last year, Prisons and Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) worked with ITE to introduce the NITEC in Services – Business Services Programme. The first batch of 29 graduated in February this year.",24,818,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00818
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Under the TAP and Grow initiative, training academies in prison have been set up in partnership with the media, precision engineering and logistics sectors. Inmates will be offered jobs by the partner employers upon release. Twenty-eight inmates completed the training and graduated with diplomas in media courses. Some of them have since been released and they are working in media-related jobs. Others are waiting for job interviews. There were 30 inmates from the first batch of training programmes for precision engineering and logistics and about 650 inmates will benefit from the TAP and Grow initiative in these three sectors every year.",25,819,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00819
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This year, YRSG does aim to make the initiative bigger and go into the food services sector. YRSG has also developed a digital literacy masterplan for inmates to gain basic digital skills in prison so that they are better prepared for the job market upon release. An estimated 750 inmates will be trained in basic digital skills each year. YRSG has also partnered IMDA to roll out digital skills training for older residents at the Selarang Halfway House and this training helps with digital services, including Government services and financial services.",26,820,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00820
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The fourth aspect I want to mention is community corrections. Research has shown that there are better rehabilitation outcomes when rehabilitation in prison is complemented by community-based programmes. And Prisons has been expanding community corrections. As at end of 2021, there were about 3,400 supervisees undergoing rehabilitation in the community, double the number from five years ago.",27,821,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00821
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Results from community corrections continue to be encouraging. In 2021, close to 90% of the inmates who were placed on community-based programmes completed them successfully. Inmates who have completed these programmes have a lower risk of reoffending. Prisons is also developing a Digitalised Learning and Support Package for inmates. The aim is to better prepare inmates for their emplacement in the community.",28,822,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00822
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The efforts I have described will not be effective if the community is not willing to give ex-offenders a second chance.

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leon Perera then reprised a part of the FICA debate. At that time, I pointed out to him that, in Singapore, we take investigations very seriously and I explained how the system works and that the Prime Minister can be the subject of independent investigations. He did not respond then, but he has come back to it today.",30,824,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00824
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What is our structure? If there is wrongdoing by anyone, whether a Minister or civil servant or private sector person, there will be investigations. Very few people doubt that. And, over the years, we have added on the checks. This Government has added on checks on itself, which are very rare elsewhere. We institutionalised it such that the CPIB can go straight to the Prime Minister but, where the Prime Minister himself is the possible subject of investigations, or if the Prime Minister does not want to do something, the CPIB can go to the President. Not many countries have done this. As I have said, I will come back to this point.",31,825,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00825
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Therefore, if there is any wrongdoing or suspected wrongdoing, known to anyone, including suspicion of foreign interference or influence, you can let CPIB know. CPIB has the resources to carry out the investigations and it has the ability to tap onto other agencies for the appropriate additional help or work that needs to be done. And FICA put in place a framework where interactions cross the line and you become the subject of foreign influence. So, there is a legal basis to act.",32,826,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00826
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leon Perera's suggestion, if I understood him correctly, is that why not we set up a separate ombudsman with the resources to carry out all these investigations? Because he had a question about whether the CPIB was adequately resourced, trained, does it have the ability to handle these matters? So, my inference from that way of phrasing the question is, therefore the agency, whichever agency is set up, must replicate, I suppose, many parts of our law enforcement agencies, including our intel agencies, so that they can do this on a standalone basis. If that is the suggestion, if I understood him correctly, I would suggest it does not make much sense because how do you replicate, and at what cost an entire investigative mechanism outside the Government?",33,827,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00827

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you only have the ombudsman without this apparatus that I have described, then he or she will go to the law enforcement agencies.

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, Mr Leon Perera referred to New Zealand and I have often found that, we make these references – they sound sexy, but then, when you actually look at what is happening, I find that the debates get very academic, without any grounding in reality, without perhaps either understanding or acknowledging what really happens in Singapore. What is our situation – how well we have managed to handle and keep corruption low and official wrongdoing low and how other countries are in this context?",36,830,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00830

McClay is infamous for receiving NZ$150,000 from a China-based businessman, Lang Lin. New Zealand allows donations from New Zealand-registered companies even if they are foreign-owned.

2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leon Perera said during the FICA debate ""quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"", if I recall correctly. For some reason, I think that phrase seems to have lost favour now. Who guards the guards? Take a hypothetical situation  say, you have an organisation, where the top leaders engage in wrongdoing or, for example, say, they set up a disciplinary committee to cover up what they did rather than actually investigate, I think you can ask ""quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"". And if Mr Leon Perera – I suppose if he was part of any such organisation, would be the first one to make such a point.",44,838,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00838
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But for the Government, with the systems in place and the variety of people who can lodge complaints and investigate – AGO, Attorney-General, you have CPIB, the Police – civil servants are obliged if they think that a Minister is doing wrong to take it up to a higher authority and, if they believe that the higher authority is not acting properly, they can take it up all the way. And these civil servants are protected through the structure of Public Service Commission, which, in turn, is protected through the fact that appointment cannot be interfered with willy-nilly by the Government. So, if you take the senior appointments, including the chief of CPIB, Chief Justice, Attorney-General – all these – there are carefully constructed structures on these appointments. So, I would say, look at all that first and look at the ground situation before we start talking about replicating more and more institutions outside.",45,839,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00839

All of the Codes, meaning the Codes for Wales, Scotland and UK, give the final authority for decisions about action to be taken to the Prime Minister or First Minister or, in Northern Ireland, the relevant nominating officer for a particular Minister's party. So, it is the prime minister. Since 2006, UK Government Ministerial Code breaches have been investigated through an independent adviser on ministerial interest or by the cabinet secretary, but there is no requirement to follow any particular process.

2022-03-03-T-012,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"As I mentioned earlier, resourcing across the SPF – that includes CAD – is indeed, very stretched.

We regularly review the salaries of our CAD officers to make sure that they are kept competitive and are able to be adjusted should market forces also move.",14,935,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00935

This partnership allowed CAD to intercept over US$33 million in criminal proceeds.",15,936,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00936

At the same time, we take a stern view of such crimes and so our laws do not protect them from prosecution or to provide further incentives. While we can understand that whistle-blowing will encourage more people to step forward to help detection, there are also other considerations that we need to consider. Including how it may create a moral hazard or lead to frivolous reporting, or there may be some cases where the whistle-blower themselves are complicit in the crime.

Key to Singapore’s counter-terrorism strategy is working closely with global security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to foil terror attacks.

Following extensive engagement by rehabilitation stakeholders, “Daniel” has renounced his support for ISIS and his radical ideologies. While in detention, he received weekly tutoring from RRG members who are also MOE-trained teachers, to prepare him for his GCE “N” level exams. He did very well in his exams, and his achievements have strengthened his resolve to change for the better. “Daniel” has since been released from detention in January 2022 and is now furthering his education.",24,945,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00945

2022-03-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"He mentioned that he was not surprised at my suggestion of a judicial check on the administration of punishments in prison. I am equally unsurprised at his disagreement with that. He referred to New Zealand and he pointed out many problems that New Zealand has recently been grappling with. There is no doubt in my mind that if I had cited another country, he would point out problems with that country as well.",2,956,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00956
2022-03-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My question would be that if instituting an independent organisation with investigative powers against the executive government, such as an ombudsman, is such a bad idea, why are so many countries doing that? I made a long speech, which I do not intend to and I cannot anyway repeat, in September 2020 when I gave detailed arguments for an ombudsman, I addressed the objections to the idea, one by one. I talked about the countries that have that. Many countries do incorporate this institution. And if you were to go to opinion leaders, and if you were to conduct public opinion polls in those countries, I am not at all sure that the majority of people would say that, ""Well, this is a bad thing, let us remove this institution and then things will get better"". So that is the first point I wanted to put across.",3,957,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00957
2022-03-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I think, fundamentally, the main argument for this ombudsman comes down to the fact that, currently, law enforcement institutions sit on the organisation chart within the executive Government, they are within that command and control hierarchy at the end of the day. An ombudsman would report to Parliament in the manner that I outlined in that earlier speech and that means that it sits fundamentally in a different place organisationally. So, when it investigates alleged abuses, it is seen to be an investigation coming from a different part of the Government.",4,958,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00958

What I can say is that in terms of the perception of legitimacy, I think there is a benefit there. The Minister mentioned various practical issues that could come about, for example, do we want to duplicate resources. I mean, there are practical solutions to that. You could design an office ombudsman to address that. For example, investigations could be directed by the office but they could seek resources from other agencies.",2,963,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00963

2022-03-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Both pertain to the surveys. I just need to be sure that both were surveys; the first one covered the mandatory death penalty. If I heard the Minister right, he said the Ministry is studying the results. And then, thereafter, Minister went on to say that in the case, for example, for intentional murder, 81% approved of the mandatory death penalty. I think there were three other statistics that he revealed in that part. Can I just confirm then what is the Ministry studying with regard to the mandatory death penalty for this particular survey?",2,971,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00971
2022-03-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to the first survey the Minister referred to, which covered foreigners in countries, I understand the Minister said where some of these drug offenders originate from. Can I confirm that that survey would be made public and not for its own sake but at least people can understand the argument vis-a-vis deterrence quite squarely and also understand the structure of the survey itself?",3,972,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00972
2022-03-03-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr Pritam Singh for both those questions. The first question relates to a survey amongst Singapore residents. We did one in 2019. We do this regularly. And then 2021, on my instructions, a part of the survey specifically focused on mandatory death penalty. Because people may have differing views on death penalty and mandatory death penalty. And the figures I gave were for mandatory death penalty.",1,973,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00973

I have been given these figures with a reasonable degree of confidence. When it is finalised, we will make it available, we will make it public, as we have made public previous surveys. There is no issue about that. It will just take the appropriate time and we will release it.",2,974,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00974

2022-03-03-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"The first clarification has to do with the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).

2022-03-03-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"I think that is a good move, but I would like to confirm with him that even if we were to go in that direction, which would make the MDA swifter, we would still retain the First Schedule which lists all the controlled drugs. And if you possess, deal in or consume any of those controlled drugs in the First Schedule, you will still be up for an offence. So, the deterrent effect on the controlled drugs remains. That is my first clarification.",3,979,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00979
2022-03-03-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,My second clarification arises out of what Minister of State Desmond Tan said on anti-terror capabilities. My question to him and my cut were really directed at what intelligence cooperation we can have across jurisdictions to ensure that there is information sharing to pre-empt a terror attack from happening in Singapore. And I had in mind collaborations with Interpol. Would he be able to confirm that MHA does work with organisations like Interpol to create a good intelligence environment to deter terrorist threats?,4,980,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00980
2022-03-03-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"The third clarification, Sir, really arises from the Minister's position on the death penalty. First, I want to say that it takes a lot of courage to come out and say that, because of the wave of liberal attitudes towards consumption of drugs in the globe today and in the region. And I want to say that as a lawmaker, it is one of the toughest decisions that I have to make for my country whenever the Misuse of Drugs act comes up, if not the toughest and I have searched my conscience and I am fully in favour of the retention of the death penalty. Why? Because 15 grammes of diamorphine – heroin – feed 180 drug abusers a week.",5,981,2022-03-03-T-012-S-00981

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, for maintenance, the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act (MOREA) provides a streamlined process for directly enforcing a foreign maintenance order issued by a court of a designated reciprocating jurisdiction. For fresh applications in Singapore for ancillary orders for foreign divorces, our Courts have been mindful to avoid unnecessary re-litigation.

As Members have noted, there has been a rise in such cases. An inter-agency committee comprising MCCY, MND, MinLaw and MHA has been working on a holistic review of the Community Disputes Management Framework, a broad holistic framework that looks at how we manage such disputes within the community from end to end as far as possible. The committee has made progress in this review. Whilst it is at this point in time premature to announce any firm measures at this stage, I can say that we are considering proposals and remedies which fall into two broad buckets.",26,1101,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01101
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, to look at enhancing upstream measures to help reduce the occurrence of disputes. For example, the committee is studying how we can forge closer relationships and partnership with the community to establish community norms for issues, such as noise and disturbances, local disamenity issues, and this includes the establishment of a community advisory panel. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann will elaborate on this during MND's Committee of Supply speech.",27,1102,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01102
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Second, if a dispute does arise, how can we enhance the framework to promote an amicable resolution as far as possible?

These features reduce the amount of information the applicant needs to provide and potential form-filling errors, which then lengthen and delay the process. This will significantly improve the service journey for self-represented applicants.",38,1113,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01113
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mr Murali Pillai raised an interesting proposal about the Japanese koseki system. We did study this. It is a system that has unique features. Interesting, but, ultimately, we felt that it was relevant for Japan's own context – quite different from our situation.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"On Mr Vikram Nair's other point, we had considered whether to allow damages-based awards but decided not to do so, at least presently, as such an approach means that fees that one charges will have no direct correlation to the quantum and value of the work done by the lawyer. We will, nonetheless, continue to study this and might have further consultations to study the appropriateness of such damages-based awards.",47,1122,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01122
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The introduction of CFAs in its current form, nonetheless, will strengthen Singapore's offerings as a legal services and dispute resolution hub – a point that I will now turn to.",48,1123,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01123
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, our status as a trusted, best-in-class and efficient legal and intellectual property (IP) system presents us at once with opportunities and advantages.

It contributes to Singapore's status as an international centre for finance, business, shipping, amongst others.",49,1124,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01124
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Singapore is building up its reputation as a legal and IP hub. In the 2021 Queen Mary University of London and White & Case International Arbitration Survey, Singapore was ranked as top arbitration seat globally, alongside London, and Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) was the most preferred arbitral institution in the Asia Pacific and second in the world. In the Global Innovation Index 2021, Singapore was amongst the world's top 10 most innovative nations.",50,1125,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01125

Beyond updates to our laws, such as CFAs, that I mentioned, we continue to evolve our international commercial dispute offerings and infrastructure to meet the end-users and the parties' changing needs. We must evolve and move with the times and I am sure that what we offer, what we have in our jurisdiction, meets the needs of users of legal services.",52,1127,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01127
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"With the pandemic, proceedings are now often held in an online or hybrid format.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, at the same time, a legal hub also needs to be supported by a strong legal talent base.

Ms Nadia Samdin and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas talked about the high attrition rates, especially amongst young lawyers, and asked how we will support and retain talent.",55,1130,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01130
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, for some context, let me just cite some numbers. In 2021, about 20% more lawyers left the profession, compared to the average of the preceding three years. This phenomenon, however, is not unique to Singapore. An International Bar Association survey of more than 3,000 young lawyers globally published in January found that a third are likely to move to a new legal profession, for example, in academia; and a fifth are likely to leave the profession entirely. So, that is about 20% likely to leave the profession entirely.",56,1131,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01131
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"They leave for a wide variety of reasons, including high workload and pressures, some of which the Members have mentioned. But while there were lawyers who left the profession, the numbers of which I have cited, there were, equally, also new entrants and re-entrants into the profession. In fact, the number of new entrants exceeded those who left the profession every year for the past four years, at least since 2018, when we kept a data bank of the numbers.",57,1132,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01132
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"There was also a net increase in the number of Practising Certificate (PC) holders, those who practise law, in 2021, compared to 2020. So, overall, while there are a number of lawyers who have left the profession, equally, as I have said, others have come into the profession either at the start as a young lawyer or, in some cases, re-enter the profession as a mid-career or more senior lawyer. That said, I understand the sentiments of young lawyers and the views expressed by Members.",58,1133,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01133
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, the start of a young lawyer’s career is challenging. Both Mr Murali Pillai and myself, we practised together as young lawyers and we know the drill. The first few years are when they go on a tremendously steep learning curve. That helps them to deepen their knowledge, quicken their experience, hone their craft and gain exposure. With these challenges, they grow professionally and, I think, if truth be told, through this experience, they become better, more experienced, more well-rounded lawyers.",59,1134,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01134
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The reality, too, is that we need to be able to compete globally. Otherwise, Singapore will be a less compelling proposition as a legal services hub. There is, therefore, no shortcut to developing legal skills. It is about the experience, it is about the ability to apply legal knowledge in the context of real-life, lived experiences, and make real commercial value judgements. If we want to be an outstanding legal hub and the jurisdiction of choice, there are no shortcuts. But we can make the journey more sustainable, more meaningful and rewarding.",60,1135,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01135
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, we will look into preparing our lawyers, especially young lawyers, more adequately for practice and, along the way, developments in practice throughout their careers. MinLaw earlier accepted the recommendations of the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers. This includes lengthening the Practice Training Period from six months to a year, to allow trainees to develop a stronger foundation in legal practice before they embark on legal practice. We will implement this next year.",61,1136,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01136

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Second, we will continue to provide lawyers with opportunities in the legal industry and the wider ecosystem. Lawyers today have more diverse options available, beyond joining as a lawyer in a Singapore law practice or joining the public sector. For instance, there are now opportunities at international law practices, in-house counsel teams, dispute resolution institutions, boutique firms and, of course, also legal tech firms.",63,1138,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01138
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"There are also more development opportunities within the Singapore law practices and the public sector.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mr Raj Joshua Thomas suggested attracting more graduate students to read law, as they are more likely to stay in the profession.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, MinLaw is at the forefront of this transformation, supporting Singapore law practices to adopt technology. We launched a Technology and Innovation Roadmap in 2020, a 10-year roadmap to guide our efforts and direction. We are working on a Legal Industry Digital Plan with IMDA and industry partners. Within the Ministry, we have set up a new Legal Technology Transformation Office, specifically to provide dedicated resources to support law firms on this journey.",68,1143,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01143
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We will also be launching the Legal Technology Platform (LTP) shortly.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We are also incorporating Singapore-specific features, features which we use best within our own local practice in our jurisdiction, including integration with existing practice management tools and solutions, and ensuring Singapore user data is hosted from Singapore, from a security perspective.",70,1145,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01145
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We have taken pains to ensure that user feedback is incorporated early into the design architecture of the system. Over the last year, we engaged over 100 lawyers from small and medium-sized law firms to obtain feedback on their usage, how they see interoperability, what functions they want to see, how they feel integration ought to take place between their own systems and the systems on the platform and so on. We established a standing LTP Industry Engagement & Advisory Group to provide continuous feedback as the product is developed and redeveloped over phases. We held a soft-launch at the end of January this year, where we provided a preview to some industry members and stakeholders, put the system with them and let them use it for a while, market test it, road test it before we finally make the launch later this year.",71,1146,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01146
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Once launched, law firms will be able to start adoption progressively. MinLaw is working to ensure firms receive technology support as they adopt the platform and beyond. We will work with Enterprise Singapore, IMDA and Law Society to encourage adoption amongst small and medium-sized law firms. We will also be exploring grants for early adopters to defray the subscription cost of the LTP and selected LTP-integrated solutions. We will share more details of this closer to the launch.",72,1147,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01147

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mr Christopher de Souza asked how we are supporting local enterprises build infrastructure and monetise IP.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, the initiatives that enable enterprises to better leverage IA and IP for growth. Enterprises can obtain IP protection quickly through the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore’s (IPOS) acceleration programme, SG IP Fast Track.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In May, IPOS will introduce the IPOS Digital Hub, a new IP registration system, which will harness the latest technologies to enhance the user experience in the IP registration process and provide businesses with new features to manage their own IP portfolio.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"IPOS is working with ACRA and the industry to develop an Intangible Asset Disclosure Framework. This will enable enterprises to better identify, communicate and disclose the value of their IP and IA for growth. We plan to consult the industry later this year, before introducing the Framework in 2023. Singapore will also work with international partners to develop internationally-recognised IA/IP valuation guidelines. This enables us to have a uniform platform, one that is internationally-recognised, on which we can say, if you have an IA or IP, this is the valuation methodology and this is how it will be recognised across different jurisdictions. This, in turn, will create more opportunities for IA/IP valuers in Singapore, anchor IA/IP valuation activities and thought leadership here and support Singapore as a trusted business and financial hub. IA/IP valuation based on internationally-recognised guidelines is also critical to enabling enterprises to transact and effectively monetise their IA/IP both in Singapore and overseas.",82,1157,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01157

To achieve this, we manage these assets along two broad thrusts.

2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Let me explain this by reference to some examples. The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has engaged extensively with market players to identify fresh concepts for existing state properties. One example is the upcoming rejuvenation of Gillman Barracks. Members may be familiar with this location. This will introduce creative lifestyle concepts to complement the existing commercial arts enclave and attract greater footfall.

I am heartened to know that an IA and IP international valuation framework or standard will be developed in Singapore.

I just want to have one clarification. I think there is also the need to synergise with the Muslim law probate process as well because there is a need for Muslim intestate beneficiaries to also extract Syariah inheritance certification from the Syariah Court; and whether there will be also plans to synergise the two systems, so that there will be a seamless transfer of documents and the certificate from the Syariah Court to the Family Justice Court, which may be administering the family justice or the probate and the letter of administration process.",1,1173,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01173

We have to work hard at doing that, and part of this is also to ensure that SIAC remains in the mindshare. So, when we talk about forays into foreign jurisdictions, as we have done with Mr Murali Pillai, I think he was present on at least one of the trips overseas to speak about our rules, to talk about our system and to, basically, socialise the idea of using SIAC. I think that is one step that will be taken.",2,1179,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01179
2022-03-03-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, I think it is important to ensure that we continue to have the best arbitrators in SIAC. We look at our Panel as one where we ensure that the best in the class, when it comes to arbitrators, are retained by SIAC – the best personnel, best expertise, best secretariat, to administer the cases. These are often the best advertisements, as it were, to ensure that parties, when they come to choosing the relevant rules, will come to choose SIAC rules and we can give them the best service.",3,1180,2022-03-03-T-013-S-01180

First, I would like to seek updates on the rollout and implementation of the code of conduct for fair tenancy and can I confirm that all Government landlords have adopted this framework? Second, what are the challenges and feedback received by the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee? Third, is MTI reviewing any parts of the code of conduct after gathering feedback and if so, which parts are under review? Fourth, I would like to request a timeline towards legislating this code of conduct into law.",6,1310,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01310
2022-03-03-T-015,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To support businesses and jobs, Singapore must continue to function as a business hub. We must continue to strive hard and be on the lookout for opportunities so that Singapore remains relevant to the global economy. However, with increased protectionism, competition from other global cities and travel restrictions, there is a need for the Singapore economy to build on our resilience and capability to catch the eye of opportunity providers.",7,1311,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01311
2022-03-03-T-015,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, how has Singapore’s performance been as an investment destination amidst the COVID-19 pandemic? Furthermore, how can Singapore better distinguish itself as a more favourable business hub and enhance our competitiveness, especially in a post-BEPS 2.0 world? What are the anticipated headwinds for Singapore and how are we positioning ourselves?",8,1312,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01312
2022-03-03-T-015,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Asia’s economy continues to be of great value to Singapore and likewise, there is great potential from emerging markets which we can tap. As a global Asia node, how is Singapore supporting our firms to capture opportunities in these markets and how has the support differed, compared to pre-COVID-19 times when the situation was different?",9,1313,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01313
2022-03-03-T-015,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, what is MTI's assessment of our regional economies, especially the rise in public and household debts due to COVID-19, and how should our businesses, especially consumer facing businesses, account for these growth plans?

Sir, the Finance Minister had, in his Budget statement, as well as his reply speech, mentioned the important role that trade associations and chambers (TACs) can play. In addition to the roles the Minister had mentioned, I would like to make the following suggestions as to what more they can do and how MTI could support them.",1,1318,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01318
2022-03-03-T-015,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"First, TACs can coordinate shared services for their members that would help them get favourable rates and enjoy economies of scale. This includes legal, accounting and human resource services, but also consultancy in core capabilities and internationalisation. In this regard, Enterprise Singapore could consider adapting the Enterprise Development Grant in a way that would allow TACs to coordinate mass funding for their members in the eligible areas.",2,1319,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01319
2022-03-03-T-015,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Second, TACs could be harnessed to administer appropriate Government schemes. A good recent example is how the SG United Training scheme is administered by the Singapore Business Federation. The sectoral TACs can similarly take charge of sector-specific schemes, within parameters worked out jointly with the relevant Government body and with funding to support the costs incurred in administering the said programmes. The TACs' closeness with their industry’s companies will be useful in that it is easier for them to explain how each scheme works and increase these companies’ participation in beneficial programmes and grants.",3,1320,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01320
2022-03-03-T-015,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Third, regulatory authorities can consider devolving some regulatory functions to TACs, where appropriate. Such devolution is most easily achieved with professional certifications and if we push the envelope a bit more, even licensing. For example, instead of regulating the facilities management sector, the Building and Construction Authority has worked closely with the Singapore International Facilities Management Association to establish accreditation schemes for firms and facility management professionals. Similarly, as debated in Parliament last year, my own association administers the Security Consultants Accreditation Programme.",4,1321,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01321
2022-03-03-T-015,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Finally, I would like to thank MTI for the TAC Growth Model Toolkit that was launched recently.

2022-03-03-T-015,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"On a related note, while TACs may get some funding from the Government pursuant to the LEAD grant, it should be the aim of all TACs to not only grow their operations and the services they offer to their members, but also to make sure they have the financial wherewithal to stand on their own two feet. In this regard, I would like to ask MTI if it will consider extending grants to TACs that are traditionally offered to SMEs to help them build revenue making activities.",6,1323,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01323

2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mr Chairman. On the strengthening of TACs to help SMEs, even as the Government has catered for significant resources to help SMEs in our pursuit of a digital and green economy, SMEs still see transformation as a cost, rather than a strategic investment or advantage. Intensifying outreach to proactively engage SMEs was a point that Minister Gan Kim Yong made in his speech at the Budget debate recently.",1,1325,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01325

In these aspects, I believe that the trade associations and chambers of commerce (TACs) can step up to play a bigger role and better define a role in partnering the Government.",2,1326,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01326
2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"With their extensive networks, TACs can be an effective bridge between agencies and our businesses and are able to galvanise members as agents of change. TACs can also play a role in encouraging knowledge sharing amongst their members, so that businesses can learn about successes and pitfalls faster in their journey for growth. Therefore, can MTI share how it can better incentivise and equip TACs to encourage them to step up their efforts in this area?",3,1327,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01327
2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In the next cut on measures to further support SMEs, Mr Chairman, the economic improvement in Singapore in 2021 is a testament to both the effectiveness of the Government's support measures for our SMEs, as well as the resilience of our local businesses. Although we are not yet out of the woods in this pandemic, our SMES can be cautiously optimistic as the world progressively opens up.",4,1328,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01328
2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"That said, there are concerns, given significant economic headwinds. Higher energy prices and supply chain disruption continue to push business costs up. Locally, our tighter wage policies relating to foreign labour have been structured to help our local workers and can also, therefore, translate into higher expenses for SMEs. The recent crisis in Ukraine has compounded these worries, as it has exacerbated the rise in energy cost.",5,1329,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01329
2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Oil prices are now expected to stay way higher than US$100 a barrel and business prospects looks a lot cloudier, when it looked a lot brighter, just a few weeks ago.

2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Beyond navigating higher business costs with funding support, the Government can also consider boosting non-financial measures to help our SMEs recover and grow.

While the industry deeply appreciates the Government's support schemes that enabled many to stay afloat, the association has given feedback that the demand aggregation (DA) procurement mechanism used by VITAL to improve Government procurement efficiency has locked out SMEs even though Mr Sharma himself and his company are on the panel. Those who are not on the panel of vendors, he describes, are unable to compete for Government jobs for the few years related to the DA contract.",10,1334,2022-03-03-T-015-S-01334

2022-03-03-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Mr Chairman, digitalisation is an imperative for SMEs to thrive in our new economy. Nonetheless, I mentioned in my Budget speech that what weighs on the minds of SME owners is the certainty of cost increases against the uncertainty of the benefits related to digitalisation.

They are essential for any company to survive and thrive in the new economy. While larger companies have the expertise and resources to do so, SMEs find it much more challenging. SMEs also hire the bulk of our workforce. Thus, their growth is critical to the Singapore workforce.

2022-03-03-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"There are two key challenges to adoption for SMEs. First, talent is needed to digitalise and automate business processes.

2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Between 2017 and 2021, there was one case of suicide that occurred among suspects, accused persons and convicted persons who were under official custody.",1,1376,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01376
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We do not track the number of cases among such persons who were not under official custody. There are usually multiple factors, including social and environmental factors, that are unrelated to investigations and convictions that may drive a person to commit suicide.",2,1377,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01377
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards measures, if an accused person is identified to be requiring mental health support, then the person will be referred to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for medical assessment and treatment.",3,1378,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01378
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In addition, the Police may, when they believe that a suspect or accused person has mental health conditions, refer the person to the Home Team Community Assistance and Referral Scheme (HT CARES). Under this scheme, CARES officers will assess whether social interventions, such as counselling and mental health assistance, are needed. They will then try and assist such persons by considering their situation and whether they need to be referred to further specialised services or IMH.",4,1379,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01379
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It must be noted that the Police and other investigative agencies’ primary task is to deter crime, investigate and deal with crime. They are not deeply trained in mental health issues. It is important that family members of the accused persons/suspects identify the mental health needs and seek the appropriate mental health assistance for such persons at an early stage.",5,1380,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01380
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When convicted persons are sentenced to imprisonment, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) will assess their mental health. Inmates diagnosed with mental health needs but whose condition is more stable are housed with the general inmate population and seen regularly by prison psychiatrists.",6,1381,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01381
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Those who are assessed to require specialised treatment are housed in the Psychiatric Housing Unit (PHU) within the Changi Prison Complex (CPC). They undergo psychiatric treatment programmes, which include therapy and counselling, conducted by IMH. They are managed by a multi-disciplinary team comprising prison officers, psychiatrists, psychologists and occupational therapists.",7,1382,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01382
2022-03-03-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SPS may also refer inmates to IMH or polyclinics for follow-up care after their release from prison. For inmates whose mental health conditions are severe enough to warrant immediate follow-up, SPS will send them directly to IMH for assessment on the day of their release.",8,1383,2022-03-03-T-018-S-01383
2022-03-03-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for National Development what is the expected timeline for the Marina East construction staging ground to be relocated out of the East Coast area.,1,1384,2022-03-03-T-019-S-01384
2022-03-03-T-019,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The operations at the Marina East staging ground have ceased since March 2020. However, there are other construction worksites in the surrounding Marina East Drive area which support key ongoing infrastructure works in the area, such as the North-South Corridor and Thomson East Coast Line.",1,1385,2022-03-03-T-019-S-01385
2022-03-03-T-019,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As we progressively develop the Marina East area, such worksites will continue to be required to support the infrastructure construction and physical development plans. Measures will continue to be taken to minimise disamenities caused by the worksites.",2,1386,2022-03-03-T-019-S-01386
2022-03-03-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will issue a circular to all veterinarians to provide guidelines on the issue of convenience euthanasia; (b) if so, when does the Ministry intend to do so; and (c) if not, why not.",1,1387,2022-03-03-T-020-S-01387
2022-03-03-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks has a framework in place to regulate the euthanasia of animals. Veterinarians are required to comply with the Code of Ethics for Veterinarians as part of their licensing conditions. Under the Code, veterinarians are required to consider animal welfare and public safety in deciding the course of treatment for an animal. Specifically, the Code provides that veterinarians must consider other treatment options prior to considering euthanasia. The Code also allows veterinarians to reject an owner’s request for euthanasia, should he or she not deem it necessary. NParks works closely with the Singapore Veterinary Association to review the Code of Ethics regularly to ensure that it is in line with developments in the veterinary sector and international best practices.",1,1388,2022-03-03-T-020-S-01388
2022-03-03-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Rehoming and Adoption Workgroup, comprising NParks, animal welfare groups, veterinarians and trainers, had discussed the topic of euthanasia arising from behavioural issues. The workgroup has developed guidelines to clarify the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, including for post-adoption support, before a decision to euthanise an animal is made. These guidelines, released in January 2022, serve to ensure that there are good understanding and communication amongst all parties. NParks will also continue to keep veterinarians updated on these guidelines through its regular veterinary newsletters and during veterinary licensing briefings.",2,1389,2022-03-03-T-020-S-01389
2022-03-03-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) since 2017, how many pre-enlistees entering National Service are granted their first and second choices of vocation respectively; (b) how does the Ministry balance the need to be universal and fair when assigning vocations while ensuring the best match of skill sets; and (c) how does the Ministry work on improving the appeal of less popular vocations.",1,1390,2022-03-03-T-021-S-01390
2022-03-03-T-021,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Based on available data, more than 70% of our full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) deployed between 2018 and 2021 have been assigned to a vocation among those that they indicated interest in. They are not required to rank their choices when indicating their interest in vocations.",1,1391,2022-03-03-T-021-S-01391
2022-03-03-T-021,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"While the NSF's choice, ability and suitability to perform the tasks required of different vocations are taken into account, the operational requirements of the SAF remain as the primary consideration in the deployment of NSFs.",2,1392,2022-03-03-T-021-S-01392
2022-03-03-T-021,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In addition, efforts have been made to help pre-enlistees appreciate the nature of all vocations and their importance to the SAF, especially for less popular choices. This is done through videos on various vocations that are available on the Central Manpower Base's website.",3,1393,2022-03-03-T-021-S-01393
2022-03-03-T-022,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Defence whether the scheme of allowing pre-enlistees entering National Service to indicate their preferred vocation of choice can be extended to NSmen who wish to utilise their newly obtained skill sets for their reservist training.,1,1394,2022-03-03-T-022-S-01394
2022-03-03-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We seek to match full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with their indicated vocations of choice, given their longer lengths of service. This is done while ensuring the SAF's operational requirements continue to be met.",1,1395,2022-03-03-T-022-S-01395
2022-03-03-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For NSmen who perform their duties for only a few weeks a year, it would not be practical or efficient to take into account their preferences in such a manner. Instead, for those with the relevant technical skills in domains, such as cybersecurity and info-communications, we have a scheme to administratively redeploy them to more suitable operational roles. This is currently performed by the SAF's Expertise Deployment Centre which was set up in 2021. Over the past eight years, around 400 NSmen with relevant expertise have been redeployed to new roles. To achieve better matching for redeployment, the SAF will also be encouraging NSmen to update their post-NS education, training and job experience through the NS Portal and other touchpoints.",2,1396,2022-03-03-T-022-S-01396
2022-03-03-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry can provide status updates on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in respect of the implementation of (i) tariff concessions and (ii) the Rules of Origin; and (b) when will further updates on the impact assessment of RCEP on Singapore be published.,1,1397,2022-03-03-T-023-S-01397
2022-03-03-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement has entered into force for 11 out of the 15 RCEP Parties. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2022 for 10 Parties, namely Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Japan, Laos, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam, and on 1 February 2022 for the Republic of Korea. The Agreement will enter into force for Malaysia on 18 March 2022.",1,1398,2022-03-03-T-023-S-01398
2022-03-03-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On average, the RCEP Agreement will eliminate tariffs on about 92% of all goods traded amongst RCEP Parties. Not all products will enjoy tariff elimination immediately upon entry into force of the Agreement. Some of this will be done in a phased approach. The timeframe for this tariff elimination varies based on product and by RCEP Party. The details of tariff concessions provided by each RCEP Party can be found at  https //www.mti.gov.sg/Improving-Trade/Free-Trade-Agreements/RCEP.",2,1399,2022-03-03-T-023-S-01399
2022-03-03-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Another benefit of the RCEP Agreement is that it provides a streamlined and common set of Rules of Origin for each product for all RCEP Parties, also known as Product Specific Rules. This allows businesses to save time and costs as they only need to meet a single rule of origin when exporting to the 15 RCEP countries. Companies will also be able to cumulate inputs from RCEP countries in order to enjoy preferential market access. These Product Specific Rules and cumulative rules of origin are implemented immediately upon the entry into force of the Agreement for the RCEP Party.",3,1400,2022-03-03-T-023-S-01400
2022-03-03-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As RCEP has just entered into force, more time will be needed to analyse the impact of the RCEP Agreement on Singapore.",4,1401,2022-03-03-T-023-S-01401
2022-03-03-T-024,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how does the Ministry plan to educate local companies and other stakeholders on their potential benefits from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.,1,1402,2022-03-03-T-024-S-01402

2022-03-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In 2021, as part of the lead up to the entry into force of the RCEP Agreement, the Ministry and our partners organised two webinars which were attended by more than 400 participants from over 200 Singapore-based companies. These webinars introduced participants to the RCEP Agreement, highlighted key benefits and demonstrated how businesses could use the Agreement. The Ministry also worked closely with the media to facilitate their understanding and reporting of the Agreement and its benefits to Singaporeans.",2,1404,2022-03-03-T-024-S-01404
2022-03-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In 2022, we will continue to organise such outreach sessions and also conduct in-depth sectoral sessions that target different business segments and highlight the relevant benefits under the RCEP Agreement.",3,1405,2022-03-03-T-024-S-01405
2022-03-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition to these webinars, the Ministry has published three guidebooks  (i) Understanding Trade in Goods and Rules of Origin under the RCEP  Benefits for Businesses; (ii) Understanding the RCEP Services, Investments and E-Commerce Chapters; and (iii) Understanding the RCEP Intellectual Property Chapter  Benefits for Businesses. These guidebooks were designed to help businesses understand and utilise the RCEP Agreement and include examples of how the RCEP Agreement will benefit them and help save costs. These guidebooks were distributed at the webinars and can be found via this weblink  https //www.mti.gov.sg/Improving-Trade/Free-Trade-Agreements/RCEP.",4,1406,2022-03-03-T-024-S-01406
2022-03-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Businesses can also take advantage of ESG's Tariff Finder at this weblink  https //www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/tariff-finder. The Tariff Finder provides information on the preferential tariffs to more than 150 destinations (covering Singapore's bilateral, regional and plurilateral FTAs), the relevant Rules of Origin, and other general requirements necessary for exportation.",5,1407,2022-03-03-T-024-S-01407

2022-03-03-T-025,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In 2018, our internal survey was focused on measuring specific components in teachers' workload. In subsequent years, our surveys had a more comprehensive coverage on teachers' workload. In 2020, due to disruptions caused by the circuit breaker, we did not conduct the typical workload survey. Instead, we conducted a series of polls to regularly monitor teachers' sentiments and morale during the pandemic.",1,1409,2022-03-03-T-025-S-01409
2022-03-03-T-025,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We, therefore, do not have comparable data for 2018 and 2020. Nevertheless, comparing the data from the 2019 and 2021 surveys, the average workload has gone up slightly from about 51 hours to about 53 hours per week during term time.",2,1410,2022-03-03-T-025-S-01410
