2022-03-10-T-001,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of lifts installed at pedestrian overhead bridges across Singapore in 2021; (b) how does this number compare to the number of lifts installed in 2019 and 2020; and (c) what is the projected annual number of lifts that will be installed at pedestrian overhead bridges for the next three years.,1.0,1,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00001
2022-03-10-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"As of end 2021, a total of 77 pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs) have been retrofitted with lifts as part of LTA's lift retrofitting programme. Of these, 26 and four POBs were retrofitted with lifts in 2021 and 2020 respectively.",1.0,2,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00002
2022-03-10-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"In 2018, LTA completed Phase 2 of its lift retrofitting programme for 41 POBs, primarily near public transport nodes. LTA was preparing for Phase 3 of the lift retrofitting programme in 2019. Preparatory works, such as site investigations and technical studies, have to be done before commencing construction, hence, it takes about 14 to 22 months to retrofit lifts at POBs.",2.0,3,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00003
2022-03-10-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Phase 3 focuses on POBs near places, such as healthcare institutions, so that lifts installed will benefit a high number of seniors and commuters with mobility challenges. This phase, which started from 2020, will see around 60 POBs being retrofitted with lifts. The remaining 30 lifts will be installed progressively over the next three years.",3.0,4,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00004

2022-03-10-T-001,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Madam. I would also like to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. Just one supplementary question. I understand that perhaps with time, the cost of installation of the lifts would come down. I would like to enquire from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary if MOT explores other alternative technologies for this. For example, conventional lifts use a certain electrical motor and mechanism, but would hydraulic lifts, for example, be a possible solution if the cost of installation of the hydraulic lifts would be a bit more economical and, therefore, allow for the Budget to be better used to serve the same purpose?",1.0,6,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00006
2022-03-10-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Madam, the Member had also asked a similar question in 2018. At that time, we shared that a pair of lifts at POBs can cost up to $4 million for installation and about $40,000 a year to maintain.",1.0,7,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00007
2022-03-10-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Indeed, over the years, we have explored different or better ways of providing such facilities. But, of course, we have to also consider the high usage and that it is cost-efficient to maintain. Currently, I am happy to share that, with experience and technologies, we have been able to bring down the cost. So, it now costs about $2 million to $3 million to install a pair of lifts. The costs also include site investigations and the technical things that need to be done, apart from the actual cost of the lift per se. Unfortunately, the maintenance has gone up from $40,000, as shared in 2018, to about $45,000 now, because of labour and other associated costs.",2.0,8,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00008
2022-03-10-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,LTA will continue to explore more cost-efficient ways to provide barrier-free access at our POBs when we retrofit them. I seek the public and Members' understanding that there is still a cost involved and priority will definitely be given to areas where we can benefit more commuters with such needs.,3.0,9,2022-03-10-T-001-S-00009
2022-03-10-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of stray animal abuse in the community are reported in the past three years; (b) whether the numbers are rising each year; (c) what are the common types of abuse and most common types of animals affected; and (d) what is the Ministry's approach towards deterring abuse of stray animals.,1.0,10,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00010
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development),"Madam, from 2019 to 2021, NParks received 654 pieces of feedback about alleged stray animal abuse. Upon investigation, 12 cases of animal abuse could be substantiated with evidence and enforcement actions were taken against the offenders. Based on the data, we do not see a rising trend in stray animal abuse cases and there are no common types of abuse observed. Most of the cases reported involved stray cats.",1.0,11,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00011
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development),"We take a serious view of all acts of animal abuse. NParks investigates all cases of feedback on animal abuse and will take enforcement action as appropriate. Individuals who are found guilty of animal abuse can be charged under the Animals and Birds Act. First-time offenders can face a maximum fine of $15,000, or a jail term of up to 18 months, or both.",2.0,12,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00012
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development),"In addition, NParks works closely with stakeholders such as animal welfare groups and veterinarians, to promote responsible interactions with animals. For example, NParks conducts outreach at pet-related events and community walkabouts and develops educational resources and programmes as part of its efforts.",3.0,13,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00013
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development),Safeguarding the welfare of animals is a shared responsibility. Members of the public can play their part by reporting suspected cases of animal abuse to NParks and providing information that might help to facilitate investigations.,4.0,14,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00014

2022-03-10-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Out of the cases of stray animal abuse over the past three years, how many animal abusers were caught? How can we better educate and create better awareness amongst community feeders about animal abuse, especially about signs and symptoms of abuse?",1.0,16,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00016
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Madam, of the 654 pieces of feedback, upon investigation, 12 cases could be substantiated. Enforcement actions were taken. To the Member's other query, most of the reported cases of stray animal abuse involve injured or dead animals that were found by members of the public. These injuries could have been caused by other circumstances, such as attacks by other animals, disease or accidents. For many of these reported cases, NParks was unable to find sufficient supporting evidence and proof that they were cases of animal abuse.",1.0,17,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00017
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"So, for members of the public who come across such cases, please let NParks know. We have a 24-hour hotline at the animal response centre, 1800 476 1600, or go to the OneService app. And please include any information that might facilitate investigations.",2.0,18,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00018

2022-03-10-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister of State for the reply as well. Could I ask two clarifications? One, I understand we are reviewing the penalties for animal cruelty and abuse. Could I just check what is the time frame for this review and when we could expect amendments to the Animals and Birds Act? And two, whether MND is also considering to include mandatory treatment orders as part of the penalties under the review?",1.0,20,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00020
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. Indeed, we are reviewing the Animals and Birds Act. We are consulting internally and will consult stakeholders when ready. We assure Members that we are working on it, including the penalty framework.",1.0,21,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00021
2022-03-10-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"The second question is around the mandatory treatment order. This is something that if the Member has views on, he can write to us with, as part of the consultation.",2.0,22,2022-03-10-T-002-S-00022
2022-03-10-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will (i) study the doubling of paternity leave by several multinational companies in Singapore to examine the effect on employability, productivity and family relationships of the employees in these companies and (ii) consider doubling the paternity leave for all fathers.",1.0,23,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00023
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Prime Minister)","Mdm Deputy Speaker, international research shows that paid parental leave, which includes paternity leave, benefits employers in terms of talent attraction, employee retention and productivity. Paternity leave is also associated with stronger relationships between fathers and their children, as well as with their wives.",1.0,24,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00024
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Prime Minister)","The Government has progressively enhanced parental leave schemes to better support parents and, particularly fathers, in playing a bigger role in raising their children. In 2017, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. Fathers can now take up to eight weeks of leave in total in their child's first year, to bond with their newborns and care for their wives.",2.0,25,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00025
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Prime Minister)","However, supporting the caregiving needs of parents must be balanced with the manpower and operational needs of employers, as I had explained in my Committee of Supply (COS) speech last week. A more sustainable approach is for companies to develop a family-friendly culture. We are heartened that some companies in Singapore are leaning forward to offer additional paternity leave, on top of legislated provisions. There are also other ways to provide more flexible leave options for staff; many companies have signed up to the Tripartite Standards on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs.",3.0,26,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00026
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Prime Minister)","We welcome these progressive companies to share their experiences and best practices with other companies. As the needs of companies vary, employers, in partnership with their employees, are best placed to assess and implement the family-friendly arrangements suited to the company's context. We will continue to work with tripartite partners to review the scope for more parental leave provisions and build a Singapore that is Made For Families.",4.0,27,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00027

2022-03-10-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Madam. I should first say we all welcome the Leader back to the House and we are glad she has recovered well. I have two clarifications. One is, I am just wondering whether the Government is going to review our parental leave policy, not immediately overnight, but, eventually, try to equalise it. I worry what message we are sending to our society when we say that mothers have 16 weeks of maternity leave and fathers have two weeks. Then, we are saying who is supposed to look after our children.",1.0,29,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00029
2022-03-10-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In line with that, the second clarification is, there are studies now that show that our policies reinforce the gender stereotypes. So, I hope the Government can study some of these studies that are out there and also do additional studies to see whether our policies really do reinforce the gender stereotypes.",2.0,30,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00030
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his clarifications. I would say that we agree that it is very important for fathers to be involved, especially at the early stage when the children are just born, for them to bond with the children and to be there for the wife and the family. As I had indicated at COS and earlier, we will continue to work with the tripartite partners to review the scope for more parental leave provisions.",1.0,31,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00031
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I think the key adjustment that we need to make is a mindset change. It is a mindset change partly on the part of fathers, partly on the part of employers. Employers are key. We have found, for example, if we look at the statistics for the taking of parental leave, that there has been an improvement, but it is still not where we want it to be. For example, in 2016, the take-up rate was 47%; in 2017, it was 53%; in 2018, it was 53%; in 2019, it was 55%. You can see that it is improving, but it is not where we would like it to be.",2.0,32,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00032
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Firstly, we hope that more and more fathers will see themselves playing a vital role when their children are born and take up the paternity leave. The second part of the equation is also how the employers respond. This is very important because if someone applies for paternity leave and you find that the supervisor is not supportive or the colleagues are not willing to cover, it makes it very difficult for the father to take that paternity leave as well.",3.0,33,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00033
2022-03-10-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"That mindset shift is something we are in transition because we see more fathers wanting to be involved; employers need to be on board. Which is why both at COS and now, I am reiterating, as indeed Mr Ng is, that it is actually better for your organisation if you are family-friendly. It is better for your organisation if you support fathers to take paternity leave, and, of course, mothers as well. This is something that we need to work with the tripartite partners on. Mr Louis Ng can be reassured that this is an area of work we will continue to look at.",4.0,34,2022-03-10-T-003-S-00034

Her first step might be to visit Workforce Singapore (WSG), to find work, amongst other organisations. But WSG officers do not just help Mrs Tan look for a job or upskilling opportunities. They also find out about her situation. And when they realise that she is in financial hardship, they will proactively link her up with a Social Service Office (SSO). That is what we are training our frontline officers to do – to identify the various needs of a client, beyond their presenting issues and connect them with the relevant support. Going forward, we will extend this training to our community partners and volunteers, so that families can get comprehensive support as soon as possible.",11.0,182,2022-03-10-T-010-S-00182

These allow ComCare families to easily access different forms of support based on just one means-testing assessment, rather than being assessed separately for each scheme. We have done this across six agencies so far, covering schemes on digital access, rental housing, healthcare, education and childcare. For Mrs Tan, once the SSO officers assess that she qualifies for ComCare, they will also assess whether her children are eligible for Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) and MOE financial assistance (FAS).",15.0,186,2022-03-10-T-010-S-00186

We will expand on this effort, to build a ""schemes bundle"" to support families with school-going children.

We are streamlining our front-end interactions with the families. Instead of burdening families with the need to interact with many different agencies and their frontline officers, we assign a pair of befrienders to each family to serve as a constant touchpoint. These befrienders journey with the family, celebrating their achievements and encouraging them through setbacks. Over time, they build rapport and trust, allowing them to better understand the family's unique circumstances and encourage the family towards their goals. The befrienders share their understanding of the families with the SSO.

We also have a training roadmap to equip our befrienders with the skills, knowledge and tact to support families.

Many ComLink families are also supported by other programmes, such as KidSTART for children up to six years old, UPLIFT for Primary and Secondary school students, or M3's Project DIAN for Malay-Muslim families. Agencies that run these programmes often carry out similar functions. For instance, they need a database to support the families' progress and a system to train and manage volunteers. We will, therefore, try to consolidate some of these common systems and processes across agencies and manage them centrally. This will also reduce coordination costs and enable us to provide more integrated support as we gear our systems to look at the progress of families more holistically, instead of along agency- or programme-specific lines.",31.0,202,2022-03-10-T-010-S-00202

Is the staff-client ratio of adult disability care facilities lower than that of the teacher-student ratio at SPED schools? If so, why is there this disparity between the two? Because this is what causes the cliff effect for those who are graduating from SPED schools. And lastly, does MSF have any plans to close this gap, given that most SPED school graduates will need to attend post-18 disability care facilities?",1.0,363,2022-03-10-T-010-S-00363

I also appreciate Mr Gerald Giam's concern for persons with disabilities. My supplementary question is whether MSF would consider convening a very specific group – either you call it Alliance for Action (AfA) or any action group – that will look into the overall holistic needs of this community. Because to ask for, say, free transport or free schools is not complete. MOE, I computed, spends about $260 million a year – there are some more cohorts coming and there are a lot of adults who do not have services now.

Which is why, in today's EMP 2030 Steering Committee, we have a whole range of representations from both the people, private and public sectors.

It is an endpoint, but it is, to me, just a checkpoint. Because what happens after 2030? It is the fourth, but, definitely, not the last masterplan that we will have. We will have to keep working at these issues because some of these things that we want to change in society pertain to mindsets, culture, how we maybe even react to persons with disabilities in our midst.

But given that many of the vulnerable communities are very low on their digital literacy, where they literally may not even know how to use Gmail on their phones, let alone to navigate Government portals, I would like to know what are the Ministry's efforts in trying to bridge this digital literacy gap and, if the befrienders from ComLink are meant to also support them on this front, then what are the ways that the Ministry might be looking at empowering befrienders and giving them the necessary access and safeguards around PDPA to support ComCare beneficiaries for their online applications?",1.0,377,2022-03-10-T-010-S-00377

The SupportGoWhere portal provides a digital enabler to help families to navigate support schemes and to be able to make the applications digitally. But we are mindful that many of our clients, including seniors, are more comfortable face-to-face, maybe on the phone, and befrienders will be a big plus. And so, all that remains – in fact, that remains core – because, in this line of work, in social service delivery, it is high-touch, high-feel. It is really an emotional connection.

And for clients who approach the SSO, way before COVID-19 or just before COVID-19, we had already put in place video conferencing capacities to enable a client of the SSO to communicate not just with the SSO officer physically, but virtually be able to link-up with the HDB officer and, of course, with other agencies as well.

Minister Masagos Zulkifli mentioned that, through ComLink, there will be a proactive approach to appear at deserving residents' doorsteps. So, I guess the lower-hanging fruits at this moment will be the existing clients in the SSO systems as well as there are also likely to be referrals from the Family Service Centres of ComCare recipients. So, my question is, can the potential pool of clients be expanded to beneficiaries of the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), MediFund as well as the various self-help groups like SINDA, MENDAKI or CDAC? So, by doing so, their application process must have a housing type and identifier in the application process.

First, on expanding beyond the existing pool that we have identified to include those from self-help groups, schools, FAS and whatnot, I am mindful that we already have 14,000 families identified for this year and the next. We do want to focus on them. I would say that let us focus on these 14,000 families because a bespoke and customised approach has to be had for each of these families. So, I do not think it is something that we want to take lightly. And once we are on a steady state with the existing 14,000 families, we will want to move on to as many other families that we can assist as possible.

They are also familiar with our way of life within Singapore's context. Since the curriculum review implemented over 20 years ago, madrasah students now are capable of pursuing either Islamic Studies at the higher education level or take up secular education.",3.0,656,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00656
2022-03-10-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Abdul Samad asked about the retention rate of students in the madrasah system. Every year, the madrasahs collectively enrol about 380 students at Primary 1. Within each cohort, about 50 students leave to join the national schools, either within the six years of Primary school education, or after the PSLE. Among those who remain, about half will pursue post-Secondary education in secular institutions. Today, about one in every four students who started their education in the madrasah graduate from the religious track and become asatizahs. One in every four students. Based on the Asatizah Manpower Planning Study, this is almost sufficient. Indeed, we should be proud that our madrasah students have no problems switching to secular education. However, it should be emphasised that the main goal of madrasah education here is to produce new asatizahs who can guide the Singapore Muslim community and expand our asatizah sector, in addition to contributing to broader sectors should they wish to do so.",4.0,657,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00657
2022-03-10-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For students who eventually become asatizahs, they need to be able to provide sound religious advice. They need to understand the lived realities of the community here and be sensitive to the cultural nuances to guide the Muslim community in navigating new and complex challenges. In line with this year's focus on enhancing competencies within our community, we will support the asatizah sector to acquire impactful competencies. This will be done through three strategies.",5.0,658,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00658

In addition to acquiring a deep knowledge of our religious traditions and having a strong character, our asatizahs must also possess the competency to contextualise religious teachings to Singapore. This requires them to form a strong connection with our multiracial society, in order to better understand our experience of living in a country full of diversity. This is especially so, because our experience as a Muslim-minority community is different from those of Muslim-majority societies.",9.0,662,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00662

One of the graduates who benefited from the PCICS programme is Ustazah Sarah El Rani. She found the programme useful in deepening her understanding of Islamic traditions, such as the use of Maqasid Shariah in Islamic Jurisprudence to address new challenges faced by societies.

Building on the two pre-conference seminars held last year, the upcoming conference will bring together religious scholars to develop critical bodies of knowledge that can guide Muslim-minority communities in multicultural societies.

This is my hope for students who have done well in the ""A"" Levels, the IB Diploma, as well as the Aliyah programmes. They are excellent candidates for the next generation of our future asatizahs.

2022-03-10-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,My second clarification is with regard to the question in my cut. What are our plans for a sectoral-based approach to enhance our PMET representations in sectors which are growing as well as sectors that are growth industries as it is now? What are our plans for corporate scholarships and partnerships because of the points that I raised earlier about low PMET numbers and the low take-up of SkillsFuture credits?,3.0,685,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00685

2022-03-10-T-011,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On postgraduate scholarships, generally, as a basis, if you look at where the Government is putting its resources today, we have made a lot of push with SkillsFuture to support individuals, regardless of where they are, to gain mastery of skills and master lifelong learning.

For Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura (WMS), like the Member has pointed out, the last one was given almost 40 years ago. In fact, more than 40 years ago. This culture of bequeathing your property to benefit yourself for your religious needs – but more importantly, to benefit society for the long term – is a culture that we have had for 1,400 years and we have had it in Singapore when Muslim Singaporeans had become wealthy during the early days of our colonisation. And in bequeathing these properties and, actually, in enhancing these properties alone, we have managed to accumulate something like almost $800 billion worth of assets.

When we work with families, like those under FITRAH, it is very complex. The structure of the families is very complex.

Sometimes, you have both parents who are in prison, incarcerated and the children are under the care of grandparents, making it very complex.",1.0,709,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00709

One is to ensure that the needs of the children are supported primarily by family members who are outside, because it is the stability of the children, while the parents are incarcerated, that is very critical. And stability comes in the form of ensuring that they continue to be able to go to school, they are able to get support for their socio-emotional development and everything around that concept. And that is the first part of looking after the children – to understand their socio-emotional needs, and even their economic needs.",2.0,710,2022-03-10-T-011-S-00710

Many residents, community partners, religious organisations, private companies and strangers reached out to me and my community to volunteer and offer various forms of help, especially to the hawkers and the vulnerable in my division. It was very heartwarming and the community became even more closely-knit and resilient.

It was especially challenging for those in technical courses where hands-on learning is important. Internship programmes had to be adjusted as firms implemented work-from-home arrangements. Those who had planned to study overseas or go for an exchange programme had their plans disrupted.

This erroneous information was provided by JTC Contract and Procurement (Construction) Division, which processed the payments without realising that the payments included felling of trees in areas that had not been approved for clearance. There was no intent by JTC staff to mislead.

However, as I stated earlier, investigations have since found that the Project Manager who was in charge, knew of the clearance before 13 January 2021. His immediate superior, the Deputy Director, also knew. It appears that they misrepresented the facts and gave inaccurate information to their superiors.",7.0,1283,2022-03-10-T-015-S-01283

This is for two reasons. First, what I have said above is based on the Police view, which could well be contested in Court, if the matter proceeds to Court.

Second, we need to be fair to the persons who may be charged; setting out the facts here should not prejudice their fair trial.",10.0,1286,2022-03-10-T-015-S-01286

Sir, if and when the matter is brought before the Court, the reasons and motives of the officers will also likely be dealt with, apart from establishing the facts. Therefore, pending any Court proceedings, I have confined myself to an account of the facts as discovered by the Police investigations.

The whole site had been earmarked for development and, eventually, development would, definitely, have proceeded. However, there are processes to be followed, including getting timely approvals from NParks, and that process was not followed. NParks has confirmed that if the due process had been followed, it would have given approval, subject to the necessary conditions being met. However, regardless of whether approvals would have been forthcoming, the JTC officers had a duty to give the correct information to their supervisors and MTI.

This investigation took some months and uncovered discrepancies in the information provided. But the two JTC officers I had earlier mentioned disputed that they had given misleading information.

The provision of sick bays at preschools allows children to rest, while parents or guardians make arrangements to pick up their child and seek medical attention as needed. This practice helps to safeguard the health and safety of sick children, while minimising the risk of infection to other children in our preschools.

Children in the sick bay must also be monitored closely by staff at all times, and preschools will have to redeploy staff from their primary duties to care for the sick child. This could compromise on the care and education for other children at the preschool.",4.0,1299,2022-03-10-T-017-S-01299

Each working parent of a Singaporean child below seven years old is eligible for six days of paid childcare leave per year. This is in addition to parents' annual leave provisions. Parents can tap on these leave provisions to bring their sick child to see a doctor and care for them at home subsequently. We urge employers to be empathetic and provide flexibility to their employees with young children during such exigencies. The Government will continue to work with tripartite partners to encourage and support employers to implement family-friendly measures, such as flexible work arrangements, so that working parents can balance their work alongside their family responsibilities.",6.0,1301,2022-03-10-T-017-S-01301

2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(a) More flexibility in manpower deployment  As all preschool staff are now fully vaccinated and are placed on weekly Rostered Routine Testing, each preschool may deploy staff across classes to deal with situations of manpower shortages, owing to staff who have been affected by COVID-19 or on medical leave. This is a relaxation of our earlier posture where the cross-deployment of staff within the preschool was restricted to minimise the risk of transmission. In areas where manpower is very tight, such as Mother Tongue Language teachers, staff may be deployed across preschools, subject to prevailing safe management measures. Preschools may also tap on relief staff who may now move across preschools to alleviate some of the manpower shortage.",2.0,1321,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01321
2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(b) Flexibility in regulatory requirements  In situations where preschools are impacted by substantial staff absenteeism, ECDA works closely with the operators to initiate their business continuity plan, such as adjusting programme plans and allowing flexibility in staffing ratios.",3.0,1322,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01322
2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(c) Streamlined processes  ECDA and the MOH have streamlined the contact tracing process to empower preschools with greater autonomy and make it easier for them to manage COVID-19 cases. For example, we have streamlined the process to allow preschools to submit details of close contacts directly to MOH, so that Health Risk Notices can be issued faster, thereby reducing the period of uncertainty for parents and staff.",4.0,1323,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01323
2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Should preschools require additional manpower, they can source for relief manpower services on EzMart, a portal hosted by the Association of Early Childhood and Training Services' (ASSETS). Preschool operators may also source through Human Resource agencies or tap on their own pool of relief staff, such as former staff, who would be familiar with the preschool's operations and children.",5.0,1324,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01324
2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To support the physical and mental well-being of staff, preschools are encouraged to monitor their staff's stress levels, consider balancing and rotating staff's responsibilities and administrative duties, provide sufficient rest breaks at reasonable intervals, as well as offer channels of support. We recognise that it may be challenging for preschools to do so where manpower is very tight. Nonetheless, we encourage preschools to press on with their efforts to shore up staff's physical and mental well-being. Preschools can tap on support provided by the Health Promotion Board, including health screening, health coaching, as well as health talks and workshops tailored for educators, covering topics, such as mental wellness.",6.0,1325,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01325
2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We recognise that preschool staff have been working tirelessly since the start of the pandemic, to ensure that our children remain safe. To appreciate their contribution towards our national efforts to fight COVID-19, and in conjunction with the Early Childhood Conference 2021, ECDA distributed care packs to all preschool staff. In addition, as part of Teachers' Day celebrations last year, the Association for Early Childhood Educators Singapore (AECES) and Preschool Market also organised a ground-up initiative known as Special Treats, where preschool educators received sponsored gift items, promotions and complimentary self-care and wellness workshops to encourage them to take time for self-care.",7.0,1326,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01326

2022-03-10-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As keeping our preschools safe and healthy is a collective effort, we encourage parents to support our preschool staff by playing their part to monitor closely their children's health. Children who are unwell should stay at home to rest, consult a primary care doctor if needed, and return to preschool only when they have fully recovered. We also encourage parents whose children are five years old and older and medically eligible, to register them for COVID-19 vaccination to give them better protection.",9.0,1328,2022-03-10-T-024-S-01328
2022-03-10-T-025,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to parents securing a place for their newly diagnosed special needs children in a Government-funded Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children run by charitable social service agencies (a) whether there is any change in the average waiting time of six months for enrolment; and (b) what is the difference in the average waiting time and out-of-pocket fees when these parents opt for the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers instead.,1.0,1329,2022-03-10-T-025-S-01329
2022-03-10-T-025,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For children who have been enrolled in an early intervention (EI) centre for the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC), the average waiting time from referral to enrolment is, currently, seven months, up from six months in 2020. However, waiting time varies across EI centres and regions, depending on demand.",1.0,1330,2022-03-10-T-025-S-01330
2022-03-10-T-025,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The increase in waiting time can be attributed to an increase in hospital referrals to Government-funded EI centres and the impact of COVID-19 and safe management measures (SMMs) over the past two years. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has been regularly reviewing the SMMs to enable EI centres to support more children.,2.0,1331,2022-03-10-T-025-S-01331

Among PPIP centres which maintained a wait list, the wait time to enrol in the programme ranged from four months to 12 months in 2021.",3.0,1332,2022-03-10-T-025-S-01332
2022-03-10-T-025,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses, that is, net fee payable by parents after Government subsidies under the PPIP programme are, generally, higher than that of EIPIC. This is because MSF provides SSA-run EI centres with additional funding to keep fees affordable. The exact difference in OOP expenses depends on the EIPIC and PPIP programme fees charged by centres and the subsidy tier the child is eligible for.",4.0,1333,2022-03-10-T-025-S-01333
2022-03-10-T-025,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, after subsidies, a middle-income family will pay about $200 more per month for a PPIP programme than for a similar EIPIC programme, assuming the median fees charged for both these programmes. The Mediacorp Enable Fund, administered by SG Enable, will provide some support for needy families which have difficulties covering the OOP expenses.",5.0,1334,2022-03-10-T-025-S-01334
