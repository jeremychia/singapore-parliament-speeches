2022-03-10-T-001-S-00001,2022-03-10-T-001,1,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of lifts installed at pedestrian overhead bridges across Singapore in 2021; (b) how does this number compare to the number of lifts installed in 2019 and 2020; and (c) what is the projected annual number of lifts that will be installed at pedestrian overhead bridges for the next three years.
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00002,2022-03-10-T-001,2,Baey Yam Keng,"As of end 2021, a total of 77 pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs) have been retrofitted with lifts as part of LTA's lift retrofitting programme. Of these, 26 and four POBs were retrofitted with lifts in 2021 and 2020 respectively."
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00003,2022-03-10-T-001,3,Baey Yam Keng,"In 2018, LTA completed Phase 2 of its lift retrofitting programme for 41 POBs, primarily near public transport nodes. LTA was preparing for Phase 3 of the lift retrofitting programme in 2019. Preparatory works, such as site investigations and technical studies, have to be done before commencing construction, hence, it takes about 14 to 22 months to retrofit lifts at POBs."
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00004,2022-03-10-T-001,4,Baey Yam Keng,"Phase 3 focuses on POBs near places, such as healthcare institutions, so that lifts installed will benefit a high number of seniors and commuters with mobility challenges. This phase, which started from 2020, will see around 60 POBs being retrofitted with lifts. The remaining 30 lifts will be installed progressively over the next three years."
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00005,2022-03-10-T-001,5,Deputy Speaker,Mr Darryl David.
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00006,2022-03-10-T-001,6,Darryl David,"Thank you, Madam. I would also like to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. Just one supplementary question. I understand that perhaps with time, the cost of installation of the lifts would come down. I would like to enquire from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary if MOT explores other alternative technologies for this. For example, conventional lifts use a certain electrical motor and mechanism, but would hydraulic lifts, for example, be a possible solution if the cost of installation of the hydraulic lifts would be a bit more economical and, therefore, allow for the Budget to be better used to serve the same purpose?"
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00007,2022-03-10-T-001,7,Baey Yam Keng,"Madam, the Member had also asked a similar question in 2018. At that time, we shared that a pair of lifts at POBs can cost up to $4 million for installation and about $40,000 a year to maintain."
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00008,2022-03-10-T-001,8,Baey Yam Keng,"Indeed, over the years, we have explored different or better ways of providing such facilities. But, of course, we have to also consider the high usage and that it is cost-efficient to maintain. Currently, I am happy to share that, with experience and technologies, we have been able to bring down the cost. So, it now costs about $2 million to $3 million to install a pair of lifts. The costs also include site investigations and the technical things that need to be done, apart from the actual cost of the lift per se. Unfortunately, the maintenance has gone up from $40,000, as shared in 2018, to about $45,000 now, because of labour and other associated costs."
2022-03-10-T-001-S-00009,2022-03-10-T-001,9,Baey Yam Keng,LTA will continue to explore more cost-efficient ways to provide barrier-free access at our POBs when we retrofit them. I seek the public and Members' understanding that there is still a cost involved and priority will definitely be given to areas where we can benefit more commuters with such needs.
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00010,2022-03-10-T-002,10,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of stray animal abuse in the community are reported in the past three years; (b) whether the numbers are rising each year; (c) what are the common types of abuse and most common types of animals affected; and (d) what is the Ministry's approach towards deterring abuse of stray animals.
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00011,2022-03-10-T-002,11,Tan Kiat How,"Madam, from 2019 to 2021, NParks received 654 pieces of feedback about alleged stray animal abuse. Upon investigation, 12 cases of animal abuse could be substantiated with evidence and enforcement actions were taken against the offenders. Based on the data, we do not see a rising trend in stray animal abuse cases and there are no common types of abuse observed. Most of the cases reported involved stray cats."
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00012,2022-03-10-T-002,12,Tan Kiat How,"We take a serious view of all acts of animal abuse. NParks investigates all cases of feedback on animal abuse and will take enforcement action as appropriate. Individuals who are found guilty of animal abuse can be charged under the Animals and Birds Act. First-time offenders can face a maximum fine of $15,000, or a jail term of up to 18 months, or both."
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00013,2022-03-10-T-002,13,Tan Kiat How,"In addition, NParks works closely with stakeholders such as animal welfare groups and veterinarians, to promote responsible interactions with animals. For example, NParks conducts outreach at pet-related events and community walkabouts and develops educational resources and programmes as part of its efforts."
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00014,2022-03-10-T-002,14,Tan Kiat How,Safeguarding the welfare of animals is a shared responsibility. Members of the public can play their part by reporting suspected cases of animal abuse to NParks and providing information that might help to facilitate investigations.
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00015,2022-03-10-T-002,15,Deputy Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00016,2022-03-10-T-002,16,Yip Hon Weng,"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Out of the cases of stray animal abuse over the past three years, how many animal abusers were caught? How can we better educate and create better awareness amongst community feeders about animal abuse, especially about signs and symptoms of abuse?"
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00017,2022-03-10-T-002,17,Tan Kiat How,"Madam, of the 654 pieces of feedback, upon investigation, 12 cases could be substantiated. Enforcement actions were taken. To the Member's other query, most of the reported cases of stray animal abuse involve injured or dead animals that were found by members of the public. These injuries could have been caused by other circumstances, such as attacks by other animals, disease or accidents. For many of these reported cases, NParks was unable to find sufficient supporting evidence and proof that they were cases of animal abuse."
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00018,2022-03-10-T-002,18,Tan Kiat How,"So, for members of the public who come across such cases, please let NParks know. We have a 24-hour hotline at the animal response centre, 1800 476 1600, or go to the OneService app. And please include any information that might facilitate investigations."
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00019,2022-03-10-T-002,19,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00020,2022-03-10-T-002,20,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister of State for the reply as well. Could I ask two clarifications? One, I understand we are reviewing the penalties for animal cruelty and abuse. Could I just check what is the time frame for this review and when we could expect amendments to the Animals and Birds Act? And two, whether MND is also considering to include mandatory treatment orders as part of the penalties under the review?"
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00021,2022-03-10-T-002,21,Tan Kiat How,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. Indeed, we are reviewing the Animals and Birds Act. We are consulting internally and will consult stakeholders when ready. We assure Members that we are working on it, including the penalty framework."
2022-03-10-T-002-S-00022,2022-03-10-T-002,22,Tan Kiat How,"The second question is around the mandatory treatment order. This is something that if the Member has views on, he can write to us with, as part of the consultation."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00023,2022-03-10-T-003,23,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will (i) study the doubling of paternity leave by several multinational companies in Singapore to examine the effect on employability, productivity and family relationships of the employees in these companies and (ii) consider doubling the paternity leave for all fathers."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00024,2022-03-10-T-003,24,Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, international research shows that paid parental leave, which includes paternity leave, benefits employers in terms of talent attraction, employee retention and productivity. Paternity leave is also associated with stronger relationships between fathers and their children, as well as with their wives."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00025,2022-03-10-T-003,25,Indranee Rajah,"The Government has progressively enhanced parental leave schemes to better support parents and, particularly fathers, in playing a bigger role in raising their children. In 2017, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. Fathers can now take up to eight weeks of leave in total in their child's first year, to bond with their newborns and care for their wives."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00026,2022-03-10-T-003,26,Indranee Rajah,"However, supporting the caregiving needs of parents must be balanced with the manpower and operational needs of employers, as I had explained in my Committee of Supply (COS) speech last week. A more sustainable approach is for companies to develop a family-friendly culture. We are heartened that some companies in Singapore are leaning forward to offer additional paternity leave, on top of legislated provisions. There are also other ways to provide more flexible leave options for staff; many companies have signed up to the Tripartite Standards on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00027,2022-03-10-T-003,27,Indranee Rajah,"We welcome these progressive companies to share their experiences and best practices with other companies. As the needs of companies vary, employers, in partnership with their employees, are best placed to assess and implement the family-friendly arrangements suited to the company's context. We will continue to work with tripartite partners to review the scope for more parental leave provisions and build a Singapore that is Made For Families."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00028,2022-03-10-T-003,28,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00029,2022-03-10-T-003,29,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Madam. I should first say we all welcome the Leader back to the House and we are glad she has recovered well. I have two clarifications. One is, I am just wondering whether the Government is going to review our parental leave policy, not immediately overnight, but, eventually, try to equalise it. I worry what message we are sending to our society when we say that mothers have 16 weeks of maternity leave and fathers have two weeks. Then, we are saying who is supposed to look after our children."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00030,2022-03-10-T-003,30,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In line with that, the second clarification is, there are studies now that show that our policies reinforce the gender stereotypes. So, I hope the Government can study some of these studies that are out there and also do additional studies to see whether our policies really do reinforce the gender stereotypes."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00031,2022-03-10-T-003,31,Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his clarifications. I would say that we agree that it is very important for fathers to be involved, especially at the early stage when the children are just born, for them to bond with the children and to be there for the wife and the family. As I had indicated at COS and earlier, we will continue to work with the tripartite partners to review the scope for more parental leave provisions."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00032,2022-03-10-T-003,32,Indranee Rajah,"I think the key adjustment that we need to make is a mindset change. It is a mindset change partly on the part of fathers, partly on the part of employers. Employers are key. We have found, for example, if we look at the statistics for the taking of parental leave, that there has been an improvement, but it is still not where we want it to be. For example, in 2016, the take-up rate was 47%; in 2017, it was 53%; in 2018, it was 53%; in 2019, it was 55%. You can see that it is improving, but it is not where we would like it to be."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00033,2022-03-10-T-003,33,Indranee Rajah,"Firstly, we hope that more and more fathers will see themselves playing a vital role when their children are born and take up the paternity leave. The second part of the equation is also how the employers respond. This is very important because if someone applies for paternity leave and you find that the supervisor is not supportive or the colleagues are not willing to cover, it makes it very difficult for the father to take that paternity leave as well."
2022-03-10-T-003-S-00034,2022-03-10-T-003,34,Indranee Rajah,"That mindset shift is something we are in transition because we see more fathers wanting to be involved; employers need to be on board. Which is why both at COS and now, I am reiterating, as indeed Mr Ng is, that it is actually better for your organisation if you are family-friendly. It is better for your organisation if you support fathers to take paternity leave, and, of course, mothers as well. This is something that we need to work with the tripartite partners on. Mr Louis Ng can be reassured that this is an area of work we will continue to look at."
2022-03-10-T-004-S-00035,2022-03-10-T-004,35,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health, given the commitment to strengthen the Singaporean Core in the nursing profession, whether the Government will review the total compensation of Singaporean nurses to bring it more in line with nursing wages in developed countries."
2022-03-10-T-004-S-00036,2022-03-10-T-004,36,Koh Poh Koon,"In setting salaries of most occupations, the salient consideration is the conditions of the local market, while taking into consideration the international market, if relevant."
2022-03-10-T-004-S-00037,2022-03-10-T-004,37,Koh Poh Koon,"In this regard, MOH regularly reviews the salaries of nurses and other healthcare staff to ensure market competitiveness. Nurses' salaries take into account both local and global references."
2022-03-10-T-004-S-00038,2022-03-10-T-004,38,Koh Poh Koon,"As I mentioned yesterday in my Committee of Supply speech, in 2021, we enhanced nursing salaries in the public healthcare sector by 5% to 14%, to be implemented over two years, including one tranche that will be given out this year. We had also increased funding support to the community care sector to ensure that nurses' salaries in the community care sector remain competitive as well."
2022-03-10-T-004-S-00039,2022-03-10-T-004,39,Koh Poh Koon,"Beyond base salaries, nurses also receive the Nurse Special Payment (NSP) in December every year. The NSP quantum is reviewed annually to ensure that nursing pay remains attractive."
2022-03-10-T-004-S-00040,2022-03-10-T-004,40,Koh Poh Koon,"Through competitive salaries and non-monetary means, we will ensure that nursing remains a viable career prospect for Singaporeans."
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00041,2022-03-10-T-005,41,,The following question stood in the name of Dr Lim Wee Kiak –
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00042,2022-03-10-T-005,42,,5 To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the Ministry doing to ensure that increases in petrol prices are not profiteering; and (b) whether oil companies can claim a rise in crude oil prices as the basis for raising petrol prices just one day after the war broke out in Ukraine on 24 February 2022.
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00043,2022-03-10-T-005,43,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Question No 5.
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00044,2022-03-10-T-005,44,Tan See Leng,"Since the start of the year, global oil prices and domestic pump prices have been rising as a result of the Russia-Ukraine tension and retailers here have been adjusting their pump prices periodically. Soon after the war broke out, three retailers raised pump prices further on 24 to 25 February, while the remaining two retailers did not adjust prices. Overall, the increase in petrol and diesel prices reflect the rise in the price of crude oil over the past months."
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00045,2022-03-10-T-005,45,Tan See Leng,"While pump prices are set by the market, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) keeps a close watch to ensure an open and competitive market. If there is evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, such as coordinated price increases, CCCS will investigate and take firm enforcement action under the Competition Act."
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00046,2022-03-10-T-005,46,Tan See Leng,"Well-informed consumers are also a key deterrent against unreasonable pricing. Fuel Kaki, a retail petrol price comparison website, which is developed by the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), empowers consumers to compare not just the retail pump prices, but also the effective price of petrol across retailers, based on the various discounts and rebates applicable to them."
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00047,2022-03-10-T-005,47,Tan See Leng,The Government will continue to monitor price movements in the retail petrol industry.
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00048,2022-03-10-T-005,48,Deputy Speaker,Leader of the Opposition.
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00049,2022-03-10-T-005,49,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Just one question for the Minister for Manpower. In view of the steep rise in the price of petrol and diesel, is the Government looking at the prospect of a support package for private hire drivers, taxi drivers, private hire bus drivers, not too dissimilar from the aviation support package announced at this year's Budget to alleviate the cost of work for them?"
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00050,2022-03-10-T-005,50,Tan See Leng,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. We are watching the situation very closely. Even as we speak, I think that there are a lot of developments today and volatility in terms of the pricing, looking also at the oil futures. These are all the various factors we take into consideration."
2022-03-10-T-005-S-00051,2022-03-10-T-005,51,Tan See Leng,"At this particular point in time, we think that the current slew of measures, the support packages and so on, appear to be having some impact in supporting them. As I have said in my previous Committee of Supply speech, we will not hesitate to roll out more. But at this particular point in time, we need to monitor the situation very, very closely."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00052,2022-03-10-T-006,52,Carrie Tan,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how is the space allocation for heavy vehicle parking lots calculated and decided for each town; (b) how often is this reviewed to ensure that there are sufficient lots to meet residents' needs; and (c) whether the MOM and the companies in sectors that employ lorry drivers are included in the review process to shift heavy vehicle parking lots away from HDB housing estates.
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00053,2022-03-10-T-006,53,Tan Kiat How,"As of December 2021, there are about 42,100 Heavy Vehicle (HV) lots islandwide, and about 32,400 HVs registered under LTA's Vehicle Parking Certificate (VPC) scheme. Hence, there are sufficient lots for all HVs islandwide."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00054,2022-03-10-T-006,54,Tan Kiat How,"We recognise that some HV drivers may prefer to park near where they reside. However, locating HV parks (HVPs) in or near residential areas comes at a high opportunity cost, as the land could otherwise cater to housing or other community needs. Residents have also raised noise and safety concerns due to heavy vehicle traffic arising from these HVPs. As the competition for land intensifies, it will be increasingly difficult to have HVPs in or near residential estates, where the tradeoffs are more acute. Today, the majority of HV lots are already located in industrial areas and privately operated."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00055,2022-03-10-T-006,55,Tan Kiat How,"As the Member has also pointed out, we have been reviewing our plans to progressively reduce the number of public HVPs in or near residential areas, to free up land to meet other development needs. Any injection of public HVPs in or near residential areas will need to be considered carefully."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00056,2022-03-10-T-006,56,Tan Kiat How,"HV drivers play an important role in our economy. We are, therefore, working closely with agencies like MTI, MOT, ESG and LTA, to ensure that there remain sufficient HV lots islandwide which are accessible to drivers, as we phase out some of our public HVPs in or near residential areas."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00057,2022-03-10-T-006,57,Tan Kiat How,"As part of this process, we take into consideration feedback from industry stakeholders, like HVP operators and HV-operating businesses, to address business needs and possible constraints. We will continue our efforts to engage stakeholders from HV-operating sectors, like the private bus and logistics sectors."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00058,2022-03-10-T-006,58,Carrie Tan,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I would just like to clarify this  it looks like a multi-Ministry effort to review the allocation of space in Singapore for HVPs. And I am just wondering whether there is an expectation by the Ministries that employers need to be responsible for the cost of commute of the HV drivers to get to and from their residence to their parked vehicle, wherever that may be located, and whether this expectation of these commuting costs has been communicated to the employers of HV drivers."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00059,2022-03-10-T-006,59,Tan Kiat How,"Madam, I thank the Member for her question and welcome her back to Parliament as well. Indeed, these are the issues that the various sector leads, the various Ministries and agencies, are discussing with their HV operating businesses. Some of these will be dependent on the specific sectors, for example, in the logistics sectors, buses for ferrying workers and passengers will be very different from sector to sector."
2022-03-10-T-006-S-00060,2022-03-10-T-006,60,Tan Kiat How,"And these are, indeed, the issues that we have been discussing with the different stakeholders. If there are specific issues or questions that the Member has encountered, please write to us. We would be happy to take a look at the specifics."
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00061,2022-03-10-T-007,61,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the Government's modelling for the expected hospital bed occupancy rates over the next five years; (b) what is the hospital bed occupancy rate it considers a safe upper limit; and (c) how does the Government derive this figure.
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00062,2022-03-10-T-007,62,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, based on MOH's modelling, the annual average public hospital Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) over the next five years would be around 80%."
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00063,2022-03-10-T-007,63,Janil Puthucheary,"A sustained BOR of less than 85% in the hospitals is, generally, recommended by academic communities and the healthcare authorities, overseas and here, to ensure patient safety. Sustained BORs above the 85% threshold may increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes due to the reduced access to hospital care."
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00064,2022-03-10-T-007,64,Janil Puthucheary,"Based on our experience, operating with a BOR of less than 85% has allowed for hospitals to have sufficient bed capacity to respond to sudden increases in bed demands, for example, during mass casualty situations and pandemics."
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00065,2022-03-10-T-007,65,Janil Puthucheary,"While there may be temporary increases over the recommended annual average BOR of 85%, our public healthcare institutions (PHIs) have mitigated the risks by managing patient flows, introducing measures, such as the use of telehealth technologies, to reduce the need for in-person consultations and right-siting care into the community and ambulatory settings."
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00066,2022-03-10-T-007,66,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00067,2022-03-10-T-007,67,Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. Just one supplementary question. Given that that is the long-term planning parameter – 80% to 85% occupancy – is there a prescribed plan or series of steps from MOH to the hospitals as to what are the contingency plans when this 85% ceiling is breached? For example, setting up augmented facilities within the same building or transferring patients to the private sector, or any other types of steps when that happens."
2022-03-10-T-007-S-00068,2022-03-10-T-007,68,Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, yes, there is. There have been for many years and those plans have been activated a number of times, including in the COVID-19 pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00069,2022-03-10-T-008,69,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry has plans to help small and medium enterprises which may be adversely affected by significantly increased fuel and energy costs due to the conflict in Ukraine.
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00070,2022-03-10-T-008,70,Tan See Leng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, t he conflict in Ukraine poses limited direct risks to our energy supplies as Singapore's energy sources are diversified. Nevertheless, as Singapore is heavily reliant on the global market for our energy supplies, we will be affected by the high and volatile global gas prices resulting from the conflict. Electricity prices are likely to remain elevated, or increase even further, in tandem with the escalating global energy costs."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00071,2022-03-10-T-008,71,Tan See Leng,"Businesses are, understandably, concerned about higher costs. EMA has taken measures to safeguard our energy security and moderate the impact of the conflict."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00072,2022-03-10-T-008,72,Tan See Leng,"I have shared them before These include  one, ensuring that electricity generation companies (gencos) have sufficient fuel reserves; two, establishing a Standby Fuel Facility (SFF) which gencos can tap on to produce electricity; and three, introducing the Temporary Retail Electricity Contracting Support (TRECS) scheme."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00073,2022-03-10-T-008,73,Tan See Leng,"We have extended TRECS from March to May 2022 and will extend it further if necessary. We are also working with gencos and electricity retailers to offer longer-term, fixed price contracts to consumers who wish to have more price stability."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00074,2022-03-10-T-008,74,Tan See Leng,"The Government has a suite of measures to support businesses, especially SMEs, to cope with higher costs. The Small Business Recovery Grant (SBRG) will help eligible firms in sectors most badly affected by COVID-19. Businesses which need financing support can also tap on ESG's programmes, such as the Temporary Bridging Loan, the Enterprise Financing Scheme, the SME Working Capital Loan, to ease their cashflows. To enable businesses to continue to upgrade themselves, we have enhanced the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and expanded the range of solutions under the Productivity Solutions Grant."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00075,2022-03-10-T-008,75,Tan See Leng,"I would like to assure this House that the Government is monitoring the situation very closely. We are prepared to put in place further measures to safeguard our energy security and assist affected businesses, as well as employees and staff alike, should there be a need to."
2022-03-10-T-008-S-00076,2022-03-10-T-008,76,Deputy Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. The Clerk will now proceed to read the Orders of the Day.

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00083,2022-03-10-T-010,83,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Chairperson, I thank Members for their thoughtful suggestions. We share the same vision of a more caring, inclusive and resilient Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00084,2022-03-10-T-010,84,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are now into the third year of our fight against COVID-19. It has been a test – not only for our healthcare systems, but also our social structures and support systems. Hence, first and foremost, I thought to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to all our social workers, social service professionals and volunteers. Throughout the pandemic, many of you stepped up – went the extra mile to care for and support Singaporeans in need, providing a critical line of social support in the community. We are deeply grateful."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00085,2022-03-10-T-010,85,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At MSF, we set up the National Care Hotline and rolled out key support schemes to protect individuals against income shocks and to meet their immediate needs, such as the Temporary Relief Fund (TRF) and COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG), where we disbursed a total of $440 million in assistance, supporting around 470,000 individuals."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00086,2022-03-10-T-010,86,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Subsequently, under the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG), we have disbursed around another $60 million so far; so, in total, $500 million. This has supported around 27,500 individuals. At the same time, we also created over 5,000 jobs and skills opportunities in the social and early childhood sectors in the past year, including for persons with disabilities."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00087,2022-03-10-T-010,87,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Singaporeans from all walks of life, joined hands and we rose against the biggest crisis of our generation. We saw families and individuals supporting one another. Neighbours extending a helping hand. Corporates and community organisations stepping up, joining hands with the Government. This spirit of working together has helped and enabled us to overcome crisis after crisis – from our Independence till today."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00088,2022-03-10-T-010,88,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Several Members have asked about the Government's plans to uplift the low-income in Singapore – Mr Leon Perera, Mr Seah Kian Peng and Ms Ng Ling Ling."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00089,2022-03-10-T-010,89,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It begins with Singapore's Social Compact, which Minister Lawrence Wong explained in the Budget speech. Our Social Compact is enabling. The Government creates conditions for growth and an enabling environment that provides affordable and quality education, healthcare and housing for all Singaporeans."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00090,2022-03-10-T-010,90,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Individuals work hard, doing the best for themselves and their families and this brings us dignity. Family members support one another through the ups and downs in life – our first line of support. Together, with the support of a caring community, the Government provides an extra hand to uplift Singaporeans in need – the low-income, the vulnerable and persons with disabilities; the citizens that MSF cares for, among others."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00091,2022-03-10-T-010,91,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Social mobility becomes possible even if inequality is unavoidable. It is Singapore's vaccination against permanent entrenchment. But we must remember that in Singapore's early days, housing, education and healthcare were nowhere near what we have today, not in terms of accessibility and much less in terms of quality."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00092,2022-03-10-T-010,92,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As a young nation, Singapore did not have much. But our pioneer leaders had the wisdom to prioritise education, housing and healthcare as the foundations of our Social Compact, alongside the CPF system for all Singaporeans – with discipline, decade after decade. Equally important, the Government successfully attracted investments into Singapore, creating job opportunities. Our forefathers worked hard because they took pride in being able to provide for their families in those hard times."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00093,2022-03-10-T-010,93,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Family members, in turn, helped one another, because social assistance was very basic and reserved for the neediest. Neighbours and friends often chipped in. Just like the present crisis, everyone stepped up. Individuals, families, communities and the Government, all working together, hand in hand."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00094,2022-03-10-T-010,94,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our Social Compact remains relevant, but has evolved over the years."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00095,2022-03-10-T-010,95,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"By the early 1990s, we introduced schemes like Edusave and MediFund that benefit many Singaporeans today. HDB housing grants were also expanded. Today, eligible first-time homebuyers can receive grants of up to $80,000 for new flats or up to $160,000 for resale flats – making public housing affordable."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00096,2022-03-10-T-010,96,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We invested heavily in our preschools, schools and higher education system to give every Singaporean child the opportunities to succeed. This has proven to be one of the biggest enablers of our society. Through education, we enable Singaporeans to be self-reliant, as they gain skills and employment. And this, in turn, supports the building of assets, like housing and savings through the CPF, enabling them to care and provide for their families with dignity and, eventually, in retirement."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00097,2022-03-10-T-010,97,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Today, a Singaporean child can receive over $180,000 of education subsidies from the preschool years till the age of 16."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00098,2022-03-10-T-010,98,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Our tax and benefits system remains progressive. Low- and middle-income households continue to receive more benefits relative to taxes paid.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00099,2022-03-10-T-010,99,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have come far. Today, around nine in 10 own their own homes. Even among the low-income, home ownership remains high. Our public healthcare system provides affordable, quality medical treatment for every citizen and is well-recognised internationally."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00100,2022-03-10-T-010,100,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On average, the Government spends over $230,000 in healthcare subsidies for each Singaporean over their lifetime. An educated and trainable workforce has continued attracting investments. Wages have grown, even after accounting for inflation, while many other advanced economies struggle with wage stagnation. Intergenerational mobility in Singapore is higher than that in North America and Europe, including for younger cohorts born from 1985 to 1989."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00101,2022-03-10-T-010,101,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Major shifts in policy have always been accompanied by efforts to enhance social assistance. Already, more is being done to protect Singaporeans against the rapid disruptions across economies. We must not allow inequality to be entrenched, as seen in many advanced economies."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00102,2022-03-10-T-010,102,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Going forward, addressing social needs will become even more complex. We did this over a decade ago when globalisation struck the world full-blown. Workfare and ComCare were rolled out and new features of our social security system, like Silver Support and MediShield Life, were introduced. Recently, we announced the expansion of the Progressive Wage Model to uplift more low-wage workers."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00103,2022-03-10-T-010,103,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComCare is a key component of our social safety nets. ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance, or SMTA, enables families to tide over temporary periods of difficulty. When clients improve their circumstances, for example, after landing a new, better paying job, Social Services Offices (SSOs) can exercise flexibility to provide extended assistance. This gives them time to stabilise their finances and strengthens the incentive to gain self-reliance. Because ultimately, we want them to bounce back together and stronger."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00104,2022-03-10-T-010,104,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Hence, in Budget 2022, to be even more enabling, we have also expanded training subsidies for ComCare recipients, making it easier for them to reskill and access good job opportunities. For example, they may take up a Digital Marketing course to move into in-demand job roles, via the new SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme announced at MOE's Committee of Supply (COS)."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00105,2022-03-10-T-010,105,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Before subsidies, they would have to pay $10,000. After subsidies, they pay less than $1,000, which can be further offset to as little as to no cost, using their SkillsFuture Credit. Eventually, with employment, they can build their assets through housing and CPF."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00106,2022-03-10-T-010,106,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We also know some in our society require permanent support. For them, we provide ComCare Long-Term Assistance. Together with philanthropy, the generosity of the public and corporates, we have made it possible to care for them as a collective. This exemplifies our shared ethos of a caring society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00107,2022-03-10-T-010,107,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To ensure its adequacy, we review the ComCare coverage and quantum every two to three years. When doing so, we reference data on households' daily living expenses and seek input from experts and community stakeholders."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00108,2022-03-10-T-010,108,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While we strengthen our support at the policy level, we must also ensure that Singaporeans in need can access them."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00109,2022-03-10-T-010,109,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Many low-income families are often time-strapped, having to juggle multiple needs and demands. We do not want this to become a barrier for them to seek assistance. This is why we started a major effort to bring assistance closer to families in a more comprehensive, convenient and coordinated manner."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00110,2022-03-10-T-010,110,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From 2013 to 2015, we set up an islandwide network of 24 Social Service Offices, or SSOs. We have also been streamlining processes and facilitating data-sharing. For example, we will put together a schemes bundle to strengthen support for ComCare families with school-going children. Once their ComCare applications are approved, they will not need to submit separate applications to access other support schemes, like MOE Financial Assistance, covered by the bundle."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00111,2022-03-10-T-010,111,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Through the enhanced SupportGoWhere portal, clients can also apply for ComCare SMTA online, instead of visiting the SSOs in person.	Finally, we have made a fundamental shift in our paradigm. Instead of waiting for clients to turn up at our offices, we want to turn up at their doors, so that we can address issues upstream. Hence, we have started scaling up Community Link (ComLink) nationwide."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00112,2022-03-10-T-010,112,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Under ComLink, families with children living in public rental housing will be supported by a team of befrienders. They will be the single touchpoint for these families, journeying with them, nudging them towards longer-term goals. Minister Desmond Lee and Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua will share more."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00113,2022-03-10-T-010,113,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Even through the early days of ComLink and working together with the community, we have enabled families to uplift themselves and improve their circumstances. Singaporeans like Mr Azman and his family are one example."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00114,2022-03-10-T-010,114,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Azman and his family had been working as delivery personnel to support their two children. They lived in a 1-room rental flat and had incurred various arrears. With the help of ComLink befrienders and their SSO coordinator, they were encouraged to take small, actionable steps to improve their circumstances. They were also supported with ComCare assistance which enabled them to cope with their daily expenses and arrears, while they re-enrolled their son in student care and moved into a larger 2-room flat. The befrienders and SSO also referred the family to various programmes, enabling them to achieve financial independence in the long term. Today, Mr Azman no longer requires ComCare assistance and his family is on the path towards home ownership."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00115,2022-03-10-T-010,115,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will continue to strengthen the ecosystem of support so that more Singaporeans like Mr Azman and his family can be uplifted. Because, ultimately, our goal is to enable all Singaporeans to flourish – whatever their race, religion, differently abled or not."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00116,2022-03-10-T-010,116,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,This brings me to my next point on the role of families as a core pillar of our Social Compact.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00117,2022-03-10-T-010,117,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Chairperson, strong families continue to be the bedrock of our society – a key pillar of strength and our first line of support, complemented by the community and enabled by the Government."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00118,2022-03-10-T-010,118,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The love and care that family members devote to one another are irreplaceable. In the face of adversity, our families protect and guide us back onto the right path, like a shining beacon, like a compass, always pointing towards the true north. Values that we treasure as a society – like love, care and concern, commitment and respect – are cultivated and transmitted through the family."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00119,2022-03-10-T-010,119,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Strong families also nurture resilient individuals who do well for themselves and their families and who, eventually, we hope, give back to the community. This is a virtuous cycle that we want to perpetuate and preserve. Our collective efforts have enabled many Singaporeans to form and raise strong families. Family remains a core part of Singapore's identity and values."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00120,2022-03-10-T-010,120,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Findings from MSF's latest ""Social Attitudes of Singaporeans"" survey show that Singaporean families continue to be close-knit. The strength of our families was also demonstrated through the pandemic. Families found new ways to support one another, making extra effort to show their love and concern."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00121,2022-03-10-T-010,121,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, we recognise the pandemic's uneven effects on different families. Those who were more vulnerable felt the strain more acutely. There were also instances of domestic violence and greater mental health concerns, exacerbated by the stressors brought upon by the pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00122,2022-03-10-T-010,122,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Furthermore, as Mr Seah Kian Peng highlighted, longer-term challenges lie ahead even as we continue grappling with COVID-19. Although families have remained strong, the geopolitical uncertainty and changing nature of work are but some examples of new stressors placing a strain on more families. Marriage rates have declined over the past twenty years and couples are having fewer children. We are also seeing a higher proportion of divorces among more recent marriage cohorts."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00123,2022-03-10-T-010,123,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,We must preserve our family core. The Government will journey alongside and support all families in Singapore.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00124,2022-03-10-T-010,124,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, we will fortify the foundations of all families. Second, we will strengthen support for families with additional needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00125,2022-03-10-T-010,125,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Members, including Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Ng Ling Ling, have underscored the importance of strengthening our family core upstream. I cannot agree more."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00126,2022-03-10-T-010,126,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We must start early by fortifying the foundations of all families. This begins as early as when a couple commits to getting married. We must enable couples to build their marriage on a sound foundation with shared values, common understanding and trust."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00127,2022-03-10-T-010,127,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Marriage is a huge commitment – one of the biggest decisions that most of us will ever make in our lives. When two people become joined as one, it can be a big transition. There are times when differences arise and may not be resolved easily. The couple may then benefit from seeking counsel from a trusted person, who has journeyed with them from the start."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00128,2022-03-10-T-010,128,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This is why we are piloting the Journey with You (JOY) initiative. We will partner selected solemnisers to mentor newlywed couples in their first year of marriage. This complements the suite of marriage preparation and enrichment programmes that help couples prepare for and strengthen their marriages. We have found early success in a similar programme for the Muslim community called Bersamamu, led by Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim, then in MSF."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00129,2022-03-10-T-010,129,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"With the foundations of a strong marriage, couples will be more confident and ready for parenthood. We will also continue supporting couples on their parenting journey, by making Singapore a great place for raising families. We will enhance the quality, accessibility and affordability of our preschools. At the community level, MSF will support the Families for Life movement. We will integrate our ecosystem of support for families with children, especially across the social-health domains, as I shared at MOH's COS yesterday."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00130,2022-03-10-T-010,130,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As Dr Tan Yia Swam mentioned, we must also bolster support for our extended families – they provide an additional layer of comfort. We recognise that many extended families were unable to gather as often during the pandemic. The eventual easing of safe management measures (SMMs) and resumption of in-person activities would allow for extended families to gather, while staying safe."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00131,2022-03-10-T-010,131,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Intergenerational ties must remain strong. Let us show appreciation for our grandparents, grandaunts and granduncles. We invite Singaporeans to do so, by joining Families for Life's annual ""Celebrating Our Grands"" initiative."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00132,2022-03-10-T-010,132,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We also recognise that every family's journey is unique. Some face greater challenges and pressures, often beyond their control. We will do more to enable these families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00133,2022-03-10-T-010,133,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Earlier, I spoke about our comprehensive range of support for low-income families. In addition to those, we have also expanded other national initiatives – like KidSTART and UPLIFT; and enhanced the Fresh Start Scheme. Coordinated via ComLink, they support low-income families across multiple domains; enabling the Government to adopt a family-centric approach, rather than being agency-driven."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00134,2022-03-10-T-010,134,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Next, for families showing early signs of stress, the Strengthening Families Programme @ Family Service Centre, or we shorten it to call it FAM@FSC, brings together marriage and divorce support programmes and family counselling to support them in a more integrated and accessible manner. We will scale up to 10 FAM@FSC centres by the end of the year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00135,2022-03-10-T-010,135,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For families with more complex needs, we provide specialised support. We will press on with our efforts to tackle family violence. The Government has accepted the 16 recommendations from the Taskforce on Family Violence. They will be implemented over the next few years."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00136,2022-03-10-T-010,136,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank Mr Faisal Manap for his suggestion to strengthen social safeguards for gambling at Singapore Pools outlets. We will continue reviewing social safeguards to ensure they stay relevant whilst balancing the need to divert gamblers from illegal operators which pose significant law and order, and social concerns. We will also continue working with the National Council on Problem Gambling to promote public awareness of the harms of excessive gambling."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00137,2022-03-10-T-010,137,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Families with members who are persons with disabilities may also face unique challenges. We have ramped up support for them over the years through our Enabling Masterplans. Today, we have a more inclusive education system for students with special needs, enhanced employment support for persons with disabilities and a growing ecosystem of support for caregivers. Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua will share more on how the Enabling Masterplan 2030 will achieve an even more inclusive Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00138,2022-03-10-T-010,138,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We cannot build an inclusive and caring society without everyone getting involved. We especially want to encourage Singaporeans who have done well to give back to society. I was glad to know that community donations have increased over the past decade, from about $1 billion in 2011 to over $1.5 billion in 2019, coupled with a rise in volunteerism."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00139,2022-03-10-T-010,139,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I agree with Ms Denise Phua that we can help volunteers play a more active role in uplifting those with less. Hence, we launched the MSFCare Network in January, bringing together over 3,000 volunteers and partners across almost 80 volunteering opportunities under a single umbrella Network."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00140,2022-03-10-T-010,140,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In fact, there are many families who are leading by example. Some foster children, providing a nurturing environment for them to flourish. Others adopt children in-need, giving them love and stable homes."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00141,2022-03-10-T-010,141,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about the review of the Adoption of Children Act.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00142,2022-03-10-T-010,142,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF has consulted the public and stakeholders. We studied best practices around the world and intend to adapt some of them for Singapore, such as mandating pre-adoption assessments and criminalising undesirable practices. We plan to introduce the Adoption of Children Bill this year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00143,2022-03-10-T-010,143,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We hope more families will be encouraged to step forward to achieve our shared vision of a more caring, just and equal society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00144,2022-03-10-T-010,144,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Chairperson, in our work at MSF, beyond families, we join hands with many organisations in the social service sector whichnshare our vision of building a resilient society, underpinned by strong families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00145,2022-03-10-T-010,145,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"During my engagements with social service professionals, a common theme that emerged was the need to place the family at the centre of our interventions, to engage collaboratively with the families so that they feel involved and empowered to turn their lives around. I would like to share an example of the inspiring work of Big Love Child Protection Specialist Centre."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00146,2022-03-10-T-010,146,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Last year, Big Love worked with a family, where the father had repeatedly hit his children and spouse. After ensuring the children's safety, the centre worked with both parents to help them understand how their actions have negatively impacted their children. They also taught them to care for their children safely and responsibly. The centre also built a network of community support around the family, joining hands with NUH, Rotary Family Service Centre and Children's Wishing Well charity."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00147,2022-03-10-T-010,147,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Through a family-centric, collaborative approach, Big Love was able to help the family address their issues and heal. There has been no recurrence of harm since. The father also spends more time with his children now. Big Love's success is a testament to the critical role that our partners play on the ground in our endeavour to build strong families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00148,2022-03-10-T-010,148,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I agree with Mr Seah Kian Peng that we must grow the capabilities of our many Social Service Agencies (SSAs), like Big Love, to support them in the good work that they do. We want to enable them to continue delivering quality, innovative and sustainable services to build strong families and meet growing needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00149,2022-03-10-T-010,149,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From April onwards, SSAs will be able to tap on the Community Capability Trust to fund their capability- and capacity-building efforts, for instance, in digitalisation or research and evaluation."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00150,2022-03-10-T-010,150,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have also seen corporates stepping up to support SSAs during the pandemic. For example, Amazon Connect worked with WE CARE Community Services to remote-enable their call centres."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00151,2022-03-10-T-010,151,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NCSS and stakeholders from the people, private and public sectors are also working to refresh the Social Service Sector Strategic Thrusts, or 4ST. The refreshed roadmap will set out the sector's commitment to building more future-directed services and capabilities over the next five years. It will also advocate for more strategic partnerships between corporates, SSAs and other community partners. More details will be released later this year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00152,2022-03-10-T-010,152,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"These sector-wide developments will also benefit our social workers, who are at the heart of our social service sector and our Family Service Centres, or FSCs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00153,2022-03-10-T-010,153,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Leon Perera and Mr Louis Ng asked about support for our social workers and FSCs. FSCs are resourced based on the number and complexity of active cases. FSCs can hire more social workers if caseloads increase and allocate cases based on the workers' experience and complexity of cases. FSCs can tap on their accumulated programme reserves to hire additional manpower. In FY2020, 68% of FSCs had an average of at least 1.5 years of programme reserves."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00154,2022-03-10-T-010,154,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF works closely with FSC leadership to monitor the caseloads and hiring, and adopt supervision practices that support the welfare of our social workers. In this manner, MSF balances between being prescriptive and allowing FSCs flexibility and autonomy to respond to needs, while looking after our social workers' interest."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00155,2022-03-10-T-010,155,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, our commitment to support families must also involve the community. Together with the Government and families, they care for those in need and reinforce the transmission of social values that we treasure, from one generation to the next. Last year, we celebrated the contributions of Singapore Women to our families and our society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00156,2022-03-10-T-010,156,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Building on this momentum, I am pleased to announce that we will dedicate 2022 as the Year of Celebrating SG Families, or YCF. YCF will rally Singaporeans to celebrate the important role that families play in our lives, encouraging families to spend time together and galvanise whole-of-society support for families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00157,2022-03-10-T-010,157,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This movement will be led by Families for Life, with the support of the Government as well as our community and commercial partners. YCF will comprise three components. First, MSF will engage the public and stakeholders via the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships and their partners, to explore how we can jointly act to strengthen families. The feedback will be consolidated into a Celebrating SG Families Plan, which will set out our society's commitment and support for families. We will unveil the Plan at the CIFA Regional Symposium & MSF Asian Family Conference 2022, in November."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00158,2022-03-10-T-010,158,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, families can look forward to celebratory events, programmes and useful family resources, with three themes – Celebrating Families; Championing Family-Friendly Workplaces and Culture; and Caring for Families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00159,2022-03-10-T-010,159,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, we will launch legacy projects that will last beyond YCF, symbolising the importance that we place on families in our society. We will start with the FamilyTrees planting initiative this Saturday. Parents can commemorate the birth of their baby by planting a tree – a reminder of the enduring role that families play in our lives. Families can also look forward to a National Family Week during the June holidays. Fun-filled events, promotions and family life education programmes will be lined up, including a family carnival; hopefully, with very little SMMs. YCF will also see the launch of a new family zone at Gardens by the Bay this July. We will share more in the coming months. Chairman, in Malay please."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00160,2022-03-10-T-010,160,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mdm Chairman, families are the bedrock of our society. During difficult and challenging times such as during this pandemic, it is our families that we turn to for support and strength."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00161,2022-03-10-T-010,161,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I am thankful that family and family values continue to be treasured by Singaporeans, including the Malay/Muslim community."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00162,2022-03-10-T-010,162,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, families will inevitably, face stressors along the way. In this regard, the Government has worked with the community to strengthen the family institution."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00163,2022-03-10-T-010,163,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Three years ago, we started the Bersamamu Programme, for Muslim solemnisers, the Kadi and Naib Kadi, to journey alongside Muslim soon-to-wed couples and newlyweds during their first two years of marriage. Today, more than 14,500 couples have benefited from this programme."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00164,2022-03-10-T-010,164,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will continue to strengthen support to all families, especially those who need additional assistance. We will scale up KidSTART nationwide progressively and enhance support for families with children living in public rental housing through Community Link, or ComLink."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00165,2022-03-10-T-010,165,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It is heartening to see families which have done well coming forward to contribute. For example, many Malay/Muslim families have become foster parents to children in need. Others have adopted these children. Seeing them open their hearts, their families and their homes readily to children in need is, indeed, heartwarming and admirable."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00166,2022-03-10-T-010,166,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To rally Singaporeans in celebrating the important role that families play in our lives, I am pleased to announce that MSF will dedicate 2022 as the ""Year of Celebrating SG Families"" (YCF). YCF will involve Government agencies, corporates and community partners, including the M3 agencies – namely MUIS, MENDAKI AND MESRA – as well as individuals and M3@Towns. There will be a range of celebratory events, programmes and useful family resources to look forward to. We will share more details soon."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00167,2022-03-10-T-010,167,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Strong and stable families shape individuals with resilience to strive and succeed. This is key to propelling the Malay/Muslim community forward. I will elaborate more on the support for the Malay/Muslim community in my MCCY speech.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00168,2022-03-10-T-010,168,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Chairman, the coming month of Ramadan represents the best opportunity for the Malay/Muslim community to continue strengthening our familial and community ties, while adhering to SMMs. Let us continue to support one another, especially those in need. Together, I am confident that we can build the best future for ourselves and our families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00169,2022-03-10-T-010,169,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In English)  Singaporeans have weathered many trials together since Independence. We will be tested with many more trials to come, but our spirit of working together will keep us strong, no matter the challenges ahead."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00170,2022-03-10-T-010,170,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In our work at MSF, we will continue supporting and uplifting families at every stage of their lives. When families are strong, our nation, too, will be able to chart our way forward on a firm foundation for generations to come. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00171,2022-03-10-T-010,171,,Minister Desmond Lee.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00172,2022-03-10-T-010,172,Desmond Lee,"Mdm Chairman, Minister Masagos Zulkifli spoke about families as an important anchor of our society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00173,2022-03-10-T-010,173,Desmond Lee,"We want all our families and every Singaporean to succeed. Over the years, we have put in place many programmes and schemes to enable Singaporeans to do well in areas, – such as housing, healthcare, education, employment, skills, social support and more, and provided additional help to those who have less."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00174,2022-03-10-T-010,174,Desmond Lee,"But some families face an array of challenges that may prevent them from seizing the opportunities in front of them – debt and financial difficulties, health problems, job instability, children struggling in school, family conflict, mindset barriers, housing insecurity, mental health issues and more. These are often complex, deep-seated and interlocking, unlike the kinds of difficulties that most families face from time to time, and they cannot be resolved by one Government agency, community partner, one social worker or on its own."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00175,2022-03-10-T-010,175,Desmond Lee,Ms Ng Ling Ling asked how MSF will better support such families and Mr Leon Perera also made a few suggestions.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00176,2022-03-10-T-010,176,Desmond Lee,"Policies, programmes and partnerships are important, but paradigms and processes are crucial, too. The way that our ecosystem works together and integrates together to deliver social services matters."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00177,2022-03-10-T-010,177,Desmond Lee,"As Minister Masagos Zulkifli said, we are making a fundamental shift in our paradigm. We want to be proactive in our approach, put the family at the centre, tap on their strengths and that of the community around them, organise our collective resources around them and try to go as far upstream as we can, so that we provide holistic support that addresses their various needs. This is a deep shift in how we deliver social services, from a programme- or agency-centric approach, towards a family-centred one."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00178,2022-03-10-T-010,178,Desmond Lee,"The transformation will take time and we have already started work a few years ago; improving inter-agency processes and officers' capabilities, building systems and enabling platforms and, importantly, strengthening and building relationships of trust within local networks on the ground to provide holistic support to families in need."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00179,2022-03-10-T-010,179,Desmond Lee,"We call this our ""3C""s approach, which we have shared in Parliament over the last few years – providing Comprehensive, Convenient and Coordinated support. Comprehensive – in addressing presenting issues, as well as deeper root causes; Convenient support – so that families can focus their energies on improving their lives; and Coordinated – across different agencies and partners."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00180,2022-03-10-T-010,180,Desmond Lee,"Through this approach, we seek to empower the family to secure a brighter future – by, first, stabilising their circumstances, then enabling them to grow in self-reliance by building up skills and resources and, ultimately, to achieve social mobility."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00181,2022-03-10-T-010,181,Desmond Lee,"Let me illustrate how we are translating this paradigm shift into action, using a ""fly-through"" of a hypothetical ComCare client – let us call her Mrs Tan."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00182,2022-03-10-T-010,182,Desmond Lee,"Mrs Tan is a working mother with school-going children and she recently lost her job. Her first step might be to visit Workforce Singapore (WSG), to find work, amongst other organisations. But WSG officers do not just help Mrs Tan look for a job or upskilling opportunities. They also find out about her situation. And when they realise that she is in financial hardship, they will proactively link her up with a Social Service Office (SSO). That is what we are training our frontline officers to do – to identify the various needs of a client, beyond their presenting issues and connect them with the relevant support. Going forward, we will extend this training to our community partners and volunteers, so that families can get comprehensive support as soon as possible."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00183,2022-03-10-T-010,183,Desmond Lee,"WSG can link Mrs Tan up with an SSO using Case Connect, our new online platform which we launched last year. Through Case Connect, agencies can refer cases to one another, share case updates, discuss next steps and bring in more partners if required. This makes it a lot easier for our colleagues to coordinate with one another and keep track of all case updates to have greater impact."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00184,2022-03-10-T-010,184,Desmond Lee,"The SSO then assesses Mrs Tan for ComCare assistance. To do this, they can use another digital system – One Client View, or OneCV, which was also launched last year. OneCV allows our frontline colleagues to pull the client's relevant information, with the client's consent, from other agencies seamlessly."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00185,2022-03-10-T-010,185,Desmond Lee,"For instance, Mrs Tan does not have to submit her CPF statements or her children's birth certificates for her ComCare application. Instead, she just provides her consent for the SSO to draw the relevant data from Government agencies backend. We will continue to enhance Case Connect and OneCV and extend them to more organisations progressively."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00186,2022-03-10-T-010,186,Desmond Lee,"The SSO assesses that Mrs Tan qualifies for ComCare. But she may need other assistance, too, for example, support with school fees for her children, from MOE. So, we have set up what we call Streamlined Assessment Protocols, or SAPs. These allow ComCare families to easily access different forms of support based on just one means-testing assessment, rather than being assessed separately for each scheme. We have done this across six agencies so far, covering schemes on digital access, rental housing, healthcare, education and childcare. For Mrs Tan, once the SSO officers assess that she qualifies for ComCare, they will also assess whether her children are eligible for Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) and MOE financial assistance (FAS)."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00187,2022-03-10-T-010,187,Desmond Lee,"OneCV and SAPs will reduce the number of times that clients have to be interviewed and means-tested. They also reduce the administrative load for our frontline colleagues. However, in some cases, SAPs still require families to submit separate applications for different schemes, which can be administratively cumbersome."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00188,2022-03-10-T-010,188,Desmond Lee,"Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Leon Perera will be glad to know that we will further streamline this process, so that eligible ComCare families automatically receive help from the relevant schemes, doing away with additional applications for each scheme. Since 2018, eligible ComCare clients automatically receive MediFund assistance and bursaries for full-time Polytechnic and ITE students. We will expand on this effort, to build a ""schemes bundle"" to support families with school-going children. By the end of the second quarter of this year, ComCare clients like Mrs Tan, whose children are in Government or Government-aided schools, will automatically receive MOE Financial Assistance, without needing to apply at their children's schools."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00189,2022-03-10-T-010,189,Desmond Lee,"Mrs Tan's Primary school-age children are enrolled at an MSF-registered Student Care Centre (SCC). So, they will also automatically qualify for maximum SCFA subsidies for 12 months. This applies to children with special needs who attend special SCCs, too. This schemes bundle covers Mrs Tan's children from Primary school to pre-tertiary studies, including after-school care. She need not worry about submitting and tracking multiple applications."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00190,2022-03-10-T-010,190,Desmond Lee,"We will progressively bundle together more schemes that cover other domains. For instance, by the end of 2022, eligible ComCare clients will be automatically referred for the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for medical and dental subsidies at participating clinics. We expect 30,000 ComCare families to benefit from the schemes bundle that we will progressively roll out. Mrs Tan's example illustrates how we are organising support around the needs of families, rather than have them come around our agencies or programmes."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00191,2022-03-10-T-010,191,Desmond Lee,"We will continue to make our processes even more convenient for families by digitalising our social services, while ensuring that in-person support remains available for those who prefer face-to-face interactions. Today, we have the SupportGoWhere portal, which consolidates information across Government schemes into one website for easy reference. But users still need to approach the various agencies separately to apply for the schemes. So, we will enhance the SupportGoWhere portal so that users can also check their eligibility for different schemes, apply for assistance directly and receive prompt updates on their application on a single platform."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00192,2022-03-10-T-010,192,Desmond Lee,"By the second quarter of 2022, families can apply for ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) and submit relevant documents through the portal directly instead of having to apply in-person at an SSO. They will then receive a phone or video call from SSO officers to understand their situation and assess their application. For those who prefer to speak to an SSO officer in person, they can still visit the SSO. We will progressively support more schemes application on this portal. These improvements will reduce the burden on families-in-need, allowing them to better focus on longer-term goals."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00193,2022-03-10-T-010,193,Desmond Lee,"These are the ways that we are transforming our delivery of social services, to provide more comprehensive, convenient and coordinated support. This approach is exemplified by our flagship initiative, which we launched in 2019 – Community Link, or ComLink for short – which several Members spoke about."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00194,2022-03-10-T-010,194,Desmond Lee,"ComLink supports families with children living in public rental housing to achieve three long-term outcomes that we mentioned earlier – stability in meeting basic needs; self-reliance where they can support themselves; and finally, social mobility, so that they can improve their circumstances."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00195,2022-03-10-T-010,195,Desmond Lee,"ComLink embodies the proactive family-centric approach that we are moving towards. We proactively reach out to families to understand their needs and aspirations. We draw relevant data across agencies, with the families' consent, to get a 360-degree view of their situation as best as possible. We work with the family and across agencies to develop goals and a dynamic common action plan. And we then bring in customised programmes and services tailored to their needs, with the support of community partners, donors, corporates and volunteers."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00196,2022-03-10-T-010,196,Desmond Lee,"Throughout this process, the family is working with us on their action plans and taking greater charge of their future."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00197,2022-03-10-T-010,197,Desmond Lee,"We announced during last year's COS that we will scale up ComLink nationwide to support over 14,000 families over the next few years. Mr Faisal Manap asked how we can build strong relationships with these families. Let me share some of the new ideas that we are trying out and what we have learnt so far. My colleague, Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, will then elaborate on our progress in scaling up ComLink."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00198,2022-03-10-T-010,198,Desmond Lee,"As I have explained, ComLink goes beyond episodic transactions with families, towards building longer-term relationships with them, partnering them, empowering them to grow. This is a much more impactful but intensive approach, involving many agencies and partners. As we scale up ComLink, we expect to run up against significant fiscal and manpower constraints."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00199,2022-03-10-T-010,199,Desmond Lee,"To find ways to better manage our resources while ensuring greater impact, we have been running learning pilots with some of our ComLink families since last year. We are streamlining our front-end interactions with the families. Instead of burdening families with the need to interact with many different agencies and their frontline officers, we assign a pair of befrienders to each family to serve as a constant touchpoint. These befrienders journey with the family, celebrating their achievements and encouraging them through setbacks. Over time, they build rapport and trust, allowing them to better understand the family's unique circumstances and encourage the family towards their goals. The befrienders share their understanding of the families with the SSO. SSO officers then serve as overall coordinator, pulling in other agencies to support the family where necessary and aligning agencies' efforts and their schemes and programmes around the family's common plan."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00200,2022-03-10-T-010,200,Desmond Lee,"We have seen good results from our befriender pilot. With befrienders, we can consolidate the manpower needed for public outreach across different agencies and programmes. But more importantly, families and befrienders have the opportunity to develop trust and deeper relationships and the families are often more motivated to follow through on their plans. We will, therefore, scale up the pilot this year to support more ComLink families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00201,2022-03-10-T-010,201,Desmond Lee,"Given how closely befrienders work with ComLink families, we agree with Mr Don Wee that befrienders must be trustworthy and adequately trained. Many of these befrienders are referred to us by community partners. And MSF interviews and conducts suitability assessments on all befrienders. We also have a training roadmap to equip our befrienders with the skills, knowledge and tact to support families. As a start, our volunteer befrienders will be paired with MSF colleagues to befriend these families. This way, we tap on both the expertise of our colleagues and the energies of the community."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00202,2022-03-10-T-010,202,Desmond Lee,"Looking ahead, we will strengthen backroom integration across agencies. Many ComLink families are also supported by other programmes, such as KidSTART for children up to six years old, UPLIFT for Primary and Secondary school students, or M3's Project DIAN for Malay-Muslim families. Agencies that run these programmes often carry out similar functions. For instance, they need a database to support the families' progress and a system to train and manage volunteers. We will, therefore, try to consolidate some of these common systems and processes across agencies and manage them centrally. This will also reduce coordination costs and enable us to provide more integrated support as we gear our systems to look at the progress of families more holistically, instead of along agency- or programme-specific lines."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00203,2022-03-10-T-010,203,Desmond Lee,"To sum up, I have set out the many things that we are doing to transform our social service delivery ecosystem along our new paradigm. These are not technical fixes or technical changes. These manifest the shift that Minister Masagos Zulkifli talked about in our social service paradigm."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00204,2022-03-10-T-010,204,Desmond Lee,"At the same time, this will also empower our frontline colleagues and social work professionals so that they, too, can focus on the most meaningful part of their mission – to support their clients through their challenges."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00205,2022-03-10-T-010,205,Desmond Lee,"Finally, we hope that our efforts will also galvanise the wider community to join us, with the assurance that their contributions will have greater impact. From community and religious groups to corporate partners, many give their time and resources generously to tackle inequality; ComLink and our other efforts to strengthen social service delivery help them achieve greater social impact by better identifying the specific needs of low-income families, through befriending and data integration across agencies; and minimising duplication and wastage across agencies, through stronger coordination of our efforts."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00206,2022-03-10-T-010,206,Desmond Lee,"Through asset-based community development and tighter social, health and community collaboration, we focus not only on the needs and gaps that exist in our society, but also the strengths that we can grow, nurture and tap on. This means building up resources in the community, investing in our families and creating the conditions that enable families to achieve their aspirations."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00207,2022-03-10-T-010,207,Desmond Lee,"We need all the help that we can get. We invite everyone to join the MSFCare Network, which Minister Masagos Zulkifli launched earlier this year, to explore volunteering and giving opportunities and connect with like-minded people in making a difference to our society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00208,2022-03-10-T-010,208,Desmond Lee,"Let us work together to build a caring and cohesive society, so that all families can be more resilient and benefit from our society of opportunities. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00209,2022-03-10-T-010,209,,Minister of State Sun Xueling.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00210,2022-03-10-T-010,210,Sun Xueling,"Minister Masagos Zulkifli had earlier spoken on the important role that families play in our lives and society and on how we will make Singapore a great place for families. Families provide the basic ingredients for us to grow into resilient and caring individuals. When family relationships are strong, they provide a safety net for individuals and a safe harbour to go home to. Families can also empower us to contribute meaningfully to society and lead happy and fulfilling lives."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00211,2022-03-10-T-010,211,Sun Xueling,"MSF is committed to providing support to build strong families and strong family relationships. Today, I will elaborate on three key areas of our efforts to do so. First, we celebrate and support families with varying needs throughout all stages of their life journey. Second, we will continue to build a fairer and more inclusive society where men and women can realise their career and family aspirations. Third, we will continue to invest heavily in early childhood development, so that every child can have a good start in life."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00212,2022-03-10-T-010,212,Sun Xueling,"Chairperson, families have played a central role in supporting us through the ups and downs in the past two years of the pandemic. In the face of COVID-19 measures, we all have found ways to adapt and care for our family members to the best of our abilities."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00213,2022-03-10-T-010,213,Sun Xueling,"It is thus timely to celebrate and strengthen the important role that families play in our lives, as Mr Murali Pillai, Ms Ng Ling Ling and Mr Seah Kian Peng have mentioned."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00214,2022-03-10-T-010,214,Sun Xueling,"Since 2014, about 58,000 parents have benefited from our evidence-based parenting programmes in MOE Primary and Secondary schools. In 2021, we started the Families for Life @ Community initiative (FFLC), in Nee Soon Central and Choa Chu Kang, to bring these programmes into the community so that more families can benefit. We will progressively introduce FFLC to more towns from 2022."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00215,2022-03-10-T-010,215,Sun Xueling,"Building on MSF's sustained efforts to strengthen families, we will designate 2022 as the Year of Celebrating SG Families (YCF). During YCF, we will scale up family bonding activities and continue to offer family enrichment programmes to equip couples and families with skills to cope with common stressors."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00216,2022-03-10-T-010,216,Sun Xueling,"Families for Life (FFL) will continue to disseminate the ""Family and Me"" preschool resource packages to cultivate an appreciation of family from a young age and nurture family values through family songs, activities and big books. We expanded this to around 50% of preschools last year and will reach out to remaining preschools by 2025."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00217,2022-03-10-T-010,217,Sun Xueling,"YCF will also build on the work of the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships (AFAM), which I chair. Mr Gan Thiam Poh had asked for an update."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00218,2022-03-10-T-010,218,Sun Xueling,AFAM was set up last year to co-create and implement solutions with key stakeholders and community groups in six Focal Areas (FAs). Allow me to share the preliminary direction for each FA.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00219,2022-03-10-T-010,219,Sun Xueling,"FA1, otherwise known as FAM Connections, led by FFL, will increase awareness and adoption of resources and evidence-based programmes on marriage and parenting. FFL will work closely with the Centre for Fathering, Mums for Life, the People's Association and many other ground-up groups."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00220,2022-03-10-T-010,220,Sun Xueling,"We will also work closely with faith communities via FA6, or Faith and Families, which will organise cross-sharing of experiences and learning points by religious organisations on their efforts to strengthen marriages and family relationships."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00221,2022-03-10-T-010,221,Sun Xueling,"For the other focal areas, FA2, Support for Young Couples, will strengthen the delivery and uptake of marriage preparation and enrichment programmes. We also aim to guide newly-weds in considering fertility health issues."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00222,2022-03-10-T-010,222,Sun Xueling,"FA3, or Parenting Together, will engage parents to identify key child-raising challenges, especially as young children grow up in the digital age and face mental well-being challenges. We will encourage more parents to take up evidence-based parenting programmes, such as Triple P and Signpost."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00223,2022-03-10-T-010,223,Sun Xueling,"Alongside FA3's work, MSF and MOE will develop resources to empower parents to support their child's mental health and well-being under the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, which I had touched on during MOE's COS."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00224,2022-03-10-T-010,224,Sun Xueling,"Even as we celebrate families this year, we recognise that family relationships are a constant work-in-progress. Mr Melvin Yong asked about how MSF will support stressed families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00225,2022-03-10-T-010,225,Sun Xueling,"FA4, Support for Single Parents, and FA5, Support for Families with Early Risks, will work closely with partners to deliver and develop initiatives that support families which may face challenges."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00226,2022-03-10-T-010,226,Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng asked about support for single unwed parents. This is a focus area under FA4, Support for Single Parents."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00227,2022-03-10-T-010,227,Sun Xueling,"The Government provides Singaporean families with broad-based benefits to support their children's development, regardless of their parents' marital status. I would like to list out 12-line items which are benefits available for both married and unwed parents. They are MediSave Grants for Newborns, MediShield Life Coverage, Infant Care Subsidy, Childcare Subsidy, Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession, education subsidies, healthcare subsidies, Baby Bonus Children Development Account (CDA), including CDA First Step, Childcare Leave, Unpaid Infant Care Leave, Maternity Leave and Adoption Leave."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00228,2022-03-10-T-010,228,Sun Xueling,Our Marriage and Parenthood incentives aim to promote marriage and encourage parenthood within marriage. This reflects the desired and prevailing societal norm.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00229,2022-03-10-T-010,229,Sun Xueling,"And these include the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Working Mother's Child Relief and Parenthood Tax Rebate. Single parents who need additional social support can approach Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Family Service Centres (FSCs) for assistance."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00230,2022-03-10-T-010,230,Sun Xueling,"Through FA4, Support for Single Parents, we are working with stakeholders and community partners to understand and address pain points that single parents have. We had conducted focus group discussions and understand that single parents face challenges with childminding, access to employment opportunities and in some cases, specific cases around housing. On childminding, MSF is partnering a Social Service Agency (SSA) to pilot a childminding service outside childcare centres' operating hours. We will share more information on this soon."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00231,2022-03-10-T-010,231,Sun Xueling,"To support upstream efforts to prevent family violence, FA5 will develop initiatives to raise awareness and share information on the building of safe, respectful and healthy relationships."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00232,2022-03-10-T-010,232,Sun Xueling,"FA5 will complement our broader efforts to tackle family violence. There has been a steady increase in the number of enquiries and new cases on family violence received by Family Violence Specialist Centres and the Integrated Services for Individual and Family Protection Specialist Centres in recent years. For instance, there were 2,906 enquiries in FY2018, of which 891 new cases were taken up. In FY2020, there were 4,574 enquiries, of which 1,103 new cases were taken up."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00233,2022-03-10-T-010,233,Sun Xueling,"The Government has accepted, in principle, all 16 recommendations from the Taskforce on Family Violence which Mr Melvin Yong had asked about. Various agencies, including MSF, will work with our partners to implement them over the next few years."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00234,2022-03-10-T-010,234,Sun Xueling,"For instance, as recommended by the task force, the MSF refreshed the Break the Silence public education campaign in November 2021 to increase awareness of the types of abuse, including non-physical forms of abuse, and to encourage survivors and bystanders to seek help."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00235,2022-03-10-T-010,235,Sun Xueling,"Also, in line with the task force's recommendations, we are enhancing our approach to better rehabilitate perpetrators of family violence. This includes amending the Women's Charter to enable mandatory assessment and treatment orders to be made for perpetrators with mental health conditions that contributed to the risk of family violence."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00236,2022-03-10-T-010,236,Sun Xueling,"While the primary responsibility for complying with rehabilitative Court orders lies with the perpetrator, we recognise the importance of strengthening rehabilitative approaches to encourage perpetrators to complete their rehabilitation. To provide more intensive and specialised support and rehabilitation for perpetrators, we will also deploy forensic-trained psychologists to community-based family violence specialist agencies by the end of this year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00237,2022-03-10-T-010,237,Sun Xueling,Not all perpetrators require alternative accommodation – perpetrators assessed to have low-risk of recurrent violent behaviours may receive intervention while living in their family home. Others may prefer staying with other family members or friends.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00238,2022-03-10-T-010,238,Sun Xueling,"To enhance the safety of survivors, we will implement a more structured referral system for social service professionals, so that perpetrators may be provided shelter, if they require accommodation. We will study the feasibility of a mandatory structured residential programme for the rehabilitation of high-risk perpetrators."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00239,2022-03-10-T-010,239,Sun Xueling,"Chairperson, women have always been key pillars of our families and society. While Singaporean women have made considerable progress in the past decades, many still bear a disproportionate amount of family and caregiving responsibilities and may face glass ceilings due to gender stereotypes. Hence, our work to strengthen families must include efforts to support our women."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00240,2022-03-10-T-010,240,Sun Xueling,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about the initiatives in the White Paper, which sets out concrete action plans to collectively realise our vision of a fairer and more inclusive society. We have been rolling out some of these plans over the past year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00241,2022-03-10-T-010,241,Sun Xueling,"For example, to protect women against violence and harm, we revised the sentencing framework for sexual and hurt offences, with increased penalties for some offences. We also released the report by the Task Force on Family Violence."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00242,2022-03-10-T-010,242,Sun Xueling,"To address gender stereotypes through education, we refreshed the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum to help our students understand the equity of familial roles and gender stereotypes about careers."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00243,2022-03-10-T-010,243,Sun Xueling,"Across all domains, we will consider changes to legislation and policies. But policies must be complemented by whole-of-society action and shifts in mindsets and behaviours. More policies and initiatives will be announced when the White Paper is presented to Parliament."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00244,2022-03-10-T-010,244,Sun Xueling,"Chairperson, the Government is committed to supporting Singaporean families in their journey to raise their children. I will next be speaking on MSF's initiatives to give every child a good start in life, regardless of their family background."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00245,2022-03-10-T-010,245,Sun Xueling,"We have been steadily building up preschool places. The number of full-day preschool places has more than doubled in the past decade – from 90,000 places in 2012 to around 200,000 as of end-2021. We will develop about 10,000 more full-day places by 2023, to meet the growing demand for preschools."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00246,2022-03-10-T-010,246,Sun Xueling,"Ms Joan Pereira will be happy to know that these new preschool places are concentrated in areas with more young families. For example, in the two newer estates of Sengkang and Punggol, the number of infant and childcare places has increased by nearly 60% in the past five years."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00247,2022-03-10-T-010,247,Sun Xueling,"By around 2025, eight in 10 preschoolers can have a place in our Government-supported preschools."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00248,2022-03-10-T-010,248,Sun Xueling,"We will further lower fee caps at Government-supported preschools in the coming years, so that working families pay around Primary school fees plus after-school student care fees for full-day childcare in the medium term."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00249,2022-03-10-T-010,249,Sun Xueling,"We agree with Mr Melvin Yong that the quality of early childhood education is critical to child development. Hence, we will continue to drive quality improvements in the sector, even as we make preschools more accessible and affordable."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00250,2022-03-10-T-010,250,Sun Xueling,"Today, I will be sharing our plans to further raise the quality of early childhood professionals and programmes, to complement parental guidance at home."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00251,2022-03-10-T-010,251,Sun Xueling,"We have increased the number of early childhood educators from 18,000 in 2018 to over 23,000 last year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00252,2022-03-10-T-010,252,Sun Xueling,"To better support the professional development of early childhood educators and leaders, we will provide clearer guidance on career and training pathways. While early childhood professionals have long been undertaking training, efforts have been uneven across the sector."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00253,2022-03-10-T-010,253,Sun Xueling,"Early childhood educators and leaders are crucial to driving the quality of education and care of our children. Today, it is my pleasure to announce the introduction of a Leadership Development Framework (LDF) to the sector. The LDF will guide educators to strengthen competencies in curriculum, pedagogy, as well as strategic and administrative leadership."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00254,2022-03-10-T-010,254,Sun Xueling,We will also enhance the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Leadership as a milestone course to better develop these competencies in our educators before they are appointed as centre leaders.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00255,2022-03-10-T-010,255,Sun Xueling,We will also do more to raise the quality of teaching and encourage the sharing of good teaching practices across the sector.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00256,2022-03-10-T-010,256,Sun Xueling,"I am pleased to share that we are developing a new Quality Teaching Tool. While many preschools already have quality teaching practices, this tool will set a common standard across the sector and guide educators on the use of effective pedagogical practices, identified based on empirical research and ground practice."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00257,2022-03-10-T-010,257,Sun Xueling,"We will also launch the Early Childhood Learning Communities, starting April this year. These learning communities will foster peer sharing of pedagogical knowledge and practices among senior educators and curriculum specialists, focusing on domain areas crucial to child development, including Social and Emotional Development, and Language and Literacy. Members of these Learning Communities will be nurtured to become future curriculum and pedagogical leaders, and to lead Communities of Practice to benefit some 300 early childhood educators within the next two years."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00258,2022-03-10-T-010,258,Sun Xueling,"To ensure programme quality in preschools, the Government has also developed national curriculum frameworks to guide the development of their programmes and curriculum."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00259,2022-03-10-T-010,259,Sun Xueling,"ECDA will review the Early Years Development Framework for children aged three and below to include areas, such as the learning of Mother Tongue languages. The revised framework will also provide more detailed guidance to support educators in creating learning experiences to develop important knowledge and skills like socioemotional skills in children. The refreshed framework will be ready by end-2023."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00260,2022-03-10-T-010,260,Sun Xueling,We recognise that some families face additional challenges and need additional support in developing their children's potential.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00261,2022-03-10-T-010,261,Sun Xueling,"The Government is committed to strengthening support for children from low-income families so that we narrow the gap starting from their early years. In tandem with KidSTART's nationwide scale-up, we will deepen partnerships with corporate and community partners through the Growing Together with KidSTART initiative."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00262,2022-03-10-T-010,262,Sun Xueling,"Ms Joan Pereira will be happy to hear that since the initiative began in 2019, we have received over $4 million in cash donations and sponsorships. Over 1,000 volunteers have stepped forward since 2016 to provide support for KidSTART families, including encouraging eligible families to join KidSTART and helping to pack and deliver essential items to families. I sincerely thank all our partners and volunteers for their contributions."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00263,2022-03-10-T-010,263,Sun Xueling,"The Government is also committed to ensuring the adequate provision of early intervention, or EI, services for children with developmental needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00264,2022-03-10-T-010,264,Sun Xueling,"To meet increased demand for subsidised EI services, ECDA will expand the number of places under the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children, otherwise known as EIPIC, through the construction of two new EI centres. ECDA will also increase the number of providers under the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers, or PPIP programme, from 10 to 16. Chairperson, in Mandarin, please."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00265,2022-03-10-T-010,265,Sun Xueling,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the central role that families play in supporting us through the many ups and downs of life. As such, it is timely for us to designate 2022 as the Year of Celebrating SG Families to celebrate and support Singaporean families."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00266,2022-03-10-T-010,266,Sun Xueling,"Last year, we set up the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships (AFAM) to work with key stakeholders and community groups to co-create and implement solutions to strengthen marriages and families, including families with young children and those with early risks."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00267,2022-03-10-T-010,267,Sun Xueling,"To provide upstream support to parents of young children, MSF is supporting the Families for Life @ Community initiative by offering more marriage and parenting programmes that are conveniently accessible."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00268,2022-03-10-T-010,268,Sun Xueling,"We will also press on with our efforts in tackling family violence and will implement the recommendations from the Taskforce on Family Violence over the next few years. For example, we will make legislative amendments to the Women's Charter to strengthen the protection and support for survivors of family violence as well as rehabilitation for perpetrators."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00269,2022-03-10-T-010,269,Sun Xueling,"On early childhood education, we will further raise the quality of early childhood professionals and programmes. To do so, we will support the professional development of early childhood professionals and develop a Quality Teaching Tool to raise the quality of teaching. We will also review the Early Years Development Framework to support educators in creating enriching learning experiences for our children."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00270,2022-03-10-T-010,270,Sun Xueling,"To provide more support to children in lower-income families, we will progressively scale up KidSTART nationwide from 2023. This will equip parents and caregivers with the knowledge and skills to support their children's well-being and development."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00271,2022-03-10-T-010,271,Sun Xueling,"(In English)  Chairman, in closing, it takes a whole-of-society effort to make Singapore a great place for families. MSF is committed to journeying with families through all seasons of life, providing nurturing learning environments for their children and paving the way to a fairer and more inclusive society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00272,2022-03-10-T-010,272,Sun Xueling,We will continue to work closely with our partners to do so and invite all Singaporeans to join us in the Year of Celebrating SG Families. [Applause.]

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00274,2022-03-10-T-010,274,Eric Chua,"Mdm Chairman, my colleagues have shared how families are the bedrock of our society. In a supportive family environment, we can better navigate life's many challenges."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00275,2022-03-10-T-010,275,Eric Chua,"But some families, including families with persons with disabilities, lower-income families and youths-at-risk face complex stressors and unique challenges. It is our responsibility as a society to journey with these families, share their burden and help them regain confidence to pursue their dreams and aspirations."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00276,2022-03-10-T-010,276,Eric Chua,I will share concrete steps that MSF is taking with our partners to support these families.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00277,2022-03-10-T-010,277,Eric Chua,Persons with disabilities face unique challenges. Family members who are caregivers to persons with disabilities often make silent sacrifices and experience caregiver stress. We recognise these difficulties and have provided greater support to these families over the years.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00278,2022-03-10-T-010,278,Eric Chua,"Ms Denise Phua, Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song and Mr Mark Chay asked about the current support for persons with disabilities and the progress of the Enabling Masterplan."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00279,2022-03-10-T-010,279,Eric Chua,We have provided greater support in several ways.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00280,2022-03-10-T-010,280,Eric Chua,"For example, 1,700 new job and training opportunities were created last year. This includes opportunities from the new Place-and-Train and Attach-and-Train programmes, which we will extend to December this year. The Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) has supported over 2,900 persons with disabilities between September 2020 and August 2021, which MOM will extend to September 2022 this year as well."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00281,2022-03-10-T-010,281,Eric Chua,"We also extended the School-to-Work Transition Programme in January last year and launched the Enabling Mark in October 2020 to recognise inclusive employers, amongst others."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00282,2022-03-10-T-010,282,Eric Chua,"In October 2021, we increased funding for Day Activity Centres (DACs) by $3 million, or 20%. This will allow our DACs to hire more care staff and to increase the quality of care for clients. We are similarly reviewing the Sheltered Workshop programme."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00283,2022-03-10-T-010,283,Eric Chua,"We have also kept assistive technology devices affordable for persons with disabilities and seniors through the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF) and the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund, which Mr Pritam Singh raised."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00284,2022-03-10-T-010,284,Eric Chua,"From April 2019 to December 2021, the ATF benefited close to 7,000 persons, with 66% of beneficiaries from households with a per capita income of $800 or less. Permanent Residents are also eligible for the ATF, with differentiated subsidy rates in line with our position to provide more subsidies to citizens. From April 2019 to December 2021, about one out of 60 ATF beneficiaries were PRs who are seniors."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00285,2022-03-10-T-010,285,Eric Chua,"The most common claims included mobility devices like motorised and manual wheelchairs, hearing aids and daily living aids."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00286,2022-03-10-T-010,286,Eric Chua,"We recently increased the ATF subsidy for Singaporeans with per capita household income of between $801 and $2,000 and expanded the range of items that seniors can be subsidised for to include medical devices like oxygen concentrators and suction pumps."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00287,2022-03-10-T-010,287,Eric Chua,"More can be done to support persons with disabilities. I am co-chairing a cross-sector committee with Mr Gan Seow Kee, vice chairperson of the Singapore Business Federation, to develop our next edition of the Enabling Masterplan, or EMP2030. EMP2030 will set meaningful longer-term goals to foster a more caring and inclusive Singapore, which will continually be monitored to ensure that we are on track on our objectives."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00288,2022-03-10-T-010,288,Eric Chua,"Today, there is a gap in services for adult persons with disabilities who do not attend any regular disability service after graduating from Special Education schools. We aim to gradually close this gap. One of the ways is through piloting regional Enabling Services Hubs (ESH) and Enabling Business Hubs (EBH)."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00289,2022-03-10-T-010,289,Eric Chua,"The Enabling Services Hubs (ESHs), co-funded by the Tote Board, provide persons with disabilities above 18 with a greater range of options for flexible social and learning activities."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00290,2022-03-10-T-010,290,Eric Chua,"Each ESH will identify and reach out to persons with disabilities and their caregivers in their region, understand their needs and link them to relevant support. Those at risk will be further supported by community befrienders. It will also provide on-site services such as continual learning programmes and social inclusion activities, for persons with disabilities and respite care for caregivers."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00291,2022-03-10-T-010,291,Eric Chua,"While the ESHs serve those with care needs, the EBHs support work-capable persons with disabilities who require customised and longer-term support to work. We will share more information on these pilots later this year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00292,2022-03-10-T-010,292,Eric Chua,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Ms Yeo Wan Ling raised an important point about doing more as a community to support caregivers. Last year, NCSS, SG Enable and community partners formed the SG Together Alliance for Action (AfA) for Caregivers of Persons with Disabilities to co-develop a self-sustaining community support model for caregivers. We started with two pilot sites in Boon Lay and Kampong Glam and the AfA has begun to support the implementation of two projects."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00293,2022-03-10-T-010,293,Eric Chua,"Project 3i is a caregiver-led initiative to provide social and emotional support for caregivers that is integrative, individualised and intentional. It will connect caregivers to form community networks and support caregivers through peer mentorship and professional support."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00294,2022-03-10-T-010,294,Eric Chua,"The second project is Community Circles, where a small group of friends, neighbours, or volunteers forms a ""circle"" of support around caregivers, to provide practical and emotional support."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00295,2022-03-10-T-010,295,Eric Chua,"These projects have initiated an ecosystem of community and peer support that reaches out to caregivers. We will evaluate the outcomes from the pilots and facilitate collaborations, so that more networks can be established to support caregivers."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00296,2022-03-10-T-010,296,Eric Chua,"Minister Masagos Zulkifli and Minister Desmond Lee highlighted how MSF has been working to strengthen our social safety net and the delivery of social services so that low-income households requiring assistance can get comprehensive, coordinated and convenient help."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00297,2022-03-10-T-010,297,Eric Chua,Mr Leon Perera will be happy to know that we have been tackling food security and unhealthy eating as part of this broader effort.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00298,2022-03-10-T-010,298,Eric Chua,"We have helped low-income households to defray the cost of purchases at supermarkets, hawker centres and heartland merchants. This includes grocery vouchers for eligible households in 2020 and Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers in 2021 and as part of the Household Support Package (HSP) in Budget 2022."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00299,2022-03-10-T-010,299,Eric Chua,"We also provide comprehensive support to households on ComCare schemes, which can include cash assistance for basic living expenses, such as food. ComCare cash assistance rates, which are regularly reviewed, take into account food-related expenditures based on the Health Promotion Board's nutritional guidelines to ensure that families can meet their nutritional needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00300,2022-03-10-T-010,300,Eric Chua,"The community also plays a big part in tackling food insecurity. Many charities and community groups have stepped forward to offer food support – dried rations, cooked meals, grocery vouchers – to families facing food needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00301,2022-03-10-T-010,301,Eric Chua,"As Ms Denise Phua has mentioned, the efforts of these groups have gone a long way in tackling food insecurity in Singapore but there are some overlaps and some gaps in the demand and supply of food support."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00302,2022-03-10-T-010,302,Eric Chua,MSF has been actively engaging food support organisations and community partners to coordinate food support. We convened the Charity Food Workgroup in 2019 to co-create a more responsive and coordinated food support ecosystem with different stakeholders.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00303,2022-03-10-T-010,303,Eric Chua,"In February this year, we soft-launched the FoodConnect directory and database. This platform allows families and social service agencies to search for food support organisations based on their location and dietary requirements, so that families can receive food which meets their needs. This allows us to move towards a more data-driven and choice-led food landscape where families can choose their preferred type of food support."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00304,2022-03-10-T-010,304,Eric Chua,"But we also want to go beyond addressing immediate needs and look at families' longer-term needs. This is where Community Link, or ComLink, comes in. Dr Shahira Abdullah asked about ComLink's objectives and our strategy to help families to attain them."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00305,2022-03-10-T-010,305,Eric Chua,"In the short term, ComLink focuses on helping families with children and youths living in rental housing to achieve stability, where their basic needs, such as day-to-day living expenses and whether their children are attending school regularly, are addressed. In the medium term, we support families towards self-reliance, such as to obtain a stable job and to sustain that employment. Stability and self-reliance then serve as building blocks towards the longer-term goal of social mobility, where the family achieves real income growth and the children and youths are able to achieve better life outcomes."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00306,2022-03-10-T-010,306,Eric Chua,ComLink achieves these objectives through its three key pillars.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00307,2022-03-10-T-010,307,Eric Chua,"First, we proactively reach out to families upstream to understand their needs, strengths and aspirations. We have reached out to more than 6,800 ComLink families so far. We then provide targeted and coordinated case support and then journey with each ComLink family to address their issues before they become more deep-seated. Together with the family, a customised action plan addressing the families' issues step-by-step is assembled. A pair of befrienders provide even closer support. Befrienders journey with families through their ups and downs and help to keep families' sights on their long-term aspirations, dreams and goals. Together, they work with the SSO coordinators to address issues that each of these families might face."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00308,2022-03-10-T-010,308,Eric Chua,"For our support to be effective, all stakeholders must work together. This is where ComLink's third pillar comes in, where the Government brings together different community partners, corporates and volunteers to provide support for families, based on collective knowledge about a community's needs and strengths."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00309,2022-03-10-T-010,309,Eric Chua,"Together, we have introduced some 74 ComLink programmes to date, including enrichment programmes, to provide children with holistic development, sports programmes to engage youths and support groups for parents. This complements the schemes and services that Government agencies are providing and, through such customised support, we can then have a stab at a transformative effect and set up families for success."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00310,2022-03-10-T-010,310,Eric Chua,Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman will be glad to know that we are fully on track to scale up ComLink over the next few years. We launched ComLink for 11 towns in 2021 and will kickstart efforts for the remaining 10 ComLink towns in the coming months.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00311,2022-03-10-T-010,311,Eric Chua,"We also want to give all our youths the opportunity to succeed in life. For those with difficult backgrounds and challenges, it is even more important that we support them."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00312,2022-03-10-T-010,312,Eric Chua,"The family plays a central role in guiding youths down the right path, particularly during adolescence, and being an anchor through the transition into adulthood. MSF is committed to helping families to do this better."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00313,2022-03-10-T-010,313,Eric Chua,"We recognise that mental well-being is an important point not just for youths, but for everyone. As part of the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, MSF is working together with various Ministries and agencies across multiple sectors to strengthen mental well-being in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00314,2022-03-10-T-010,314,Eric Chua,"We will increase accessibility to a continuum of services across our healthcare institutions, schools and community agencies, so that everyone can receive the appropriate level of care and support. We also want to make sure that these services are well-integrated, so that it is easier to navigate the mental health ecosystem."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00315,2022-03-10-T-010,315,Eric Chua,National Council of Social Service (NCSS) will expand the Beyond The Label campaign to involve more partners and the public in encouraging early help-seeking and greater acceptance of persons with mental health conditions.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00316,2022-03-10-T-010,316,Eric Chua,"As Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has previously mentioned, NCSS and MOM are studying ways to strengthen support for persons with mental health conditions before and during employment and for their colleagues, so as to create a more inclusive work environment."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00317,2022-03-10-T-010,317,Eric Chua,"These are all complex issues that can only be solved through a whole-of-society effort. As Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary has mentioned, the task force will be conducting a public consultation on these ideas and we look forward to developing a national strategy and action plan together with all Singaporeans."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00318,2022-03-10-T-010,318,Eric Chua,"Another group of youths who may need special attention are those who leave the formal education system early. Like Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong and Mr Seah Kian Peng, we believe in the tremendous value of mentoring for these youths."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00319,2022-03-10-T-010,319,Eric Chua,"Co-designed with MOE and ITE, and in partnership with Trybe Limited, our Career Advice and Mentoring Programme (CAMP) will expand networks of positive relationships for youths who leave ITE prematurely and empower them to achieve their aspirations. Under CAMP, mentors are matched with mentees based on the mentees' industries of interest and will guide their mentees in exploring their interests and broadening their exposure to opportunities. Since its launch in January this year, 14 mentors and 10 youths have come on board and more are expected to join in the coming months. Over the two years' pilot, we aim to support 100 youths."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00320,2022-03-10-T-010,320,Eric Chua,"One of the mentors who have stepped forward is Lawrence Tharekheshwaren Supramany, an ITE alumnus with over 4.5 years of experience in the automotive industry. In his youth, Lawrence was involved in a riot. However, he turned his life around with the support of his community, notably from his pastor, who provided guidance and tutoring. Having personally experienced the transformative effect of a mentor in his life, Lawrence intends to inspire other youths as a CAMP mentor."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00321,2022-03-10-T-010,321,Eric Chua,"MSF will track the outcomes of the CAMP youths, such as placement in education, training or employment and assess the suitability of scaling up CAMP beyond the pilot phase."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00322,2022-03-10-T-010,322,Eric Chua,"As Ms Denise Phua has mentioned, the Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) is an important life planning tool should one lose mental capacity. As of 2021, about 130,000 Singapore Citizens, or about 4% of all eligible adult citizens, have registered their LPAs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00323,2022-03-10-T-010,323,Eric Chua,"To promote greater awareness of pre-planning tools, such as LPA and Advance Care Planning, MSF and MOH will conduct a joint awareness campaign later this year. We will also launch the new Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) Online system, which allows citizens to digitally make an LPA in a simple, convenient and secure manner. The fee waiver for LPA applications will also run right through March 2023."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00324,2022-03-10-T-010,324,Eric Chua,"On deputyship, there were 2,794 Court orders appointing deputies in the past five years, with the number growing at about 25% annually. To simplify the application process, the Family Justice Courts have enabled applicants to apply for general orders through the Simplified Track on the Integrated Family Application Management System since 2019. This, typically, covers powers to consent to medical and dental treatment, care arrangements, manage bank or CPF accounts and insurance, set up Special Needs Trust Company accounts, and employment contracts."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00325,2022-03-10-T-010,325,Eric Chua,"MSF also offers the Assisted Deputyship Application Programme (ADAP) for persons with disabilities who do not have mental capacity and who are enrolled in various Special Education schools, Day Activity Centres and Sheltered Workshops. ADAP applicants are provided with mental capacity assessment reports at no cost to the applicant and guidance for applying via the Simplified Track."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00326,2022-03-10-T-010,326,Eric Chua,"The Simplified Track costs $40 in Court filing fees and are usually granted within four to six weeks. The costs and duration are higher for more complex Court orders, which, typically, involve adults and elderly who lose capacity without making an LPA. Thus, I urge all Singaporeans to have your LPAs registered, to provide peace of mind to yourselves and to your loved ones. We will continue to work with community partners to facilitate access to pro-bono or low-cost services. Madam, in Mandarin, please."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00327,2022-03-10-T-010,327,Eric Chua,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Families are the bedrock of our society. When our youths face challenges, families will always be a refuge to comfort them. Families are the source of purpose and strength to guide our youths back to the right path and bounce back. With families' love and care, I believe that our youths can grow into resilient individuals, fulfil their potential and, ultimately, contribute back to society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00328,2022-03-10-T-010,328,Eric Chua,"The mental well-being of our youths is an important priority. While parents will always remain a core pillar of support, the Government will continue working closely with our partners to complement family support. We will transform the YMWBN into a national network to develop whole-of-society partnerships to support the mental well-being of all in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00329,2022-03-10-T-010,329,Eric Chua,"Youths who leave formal education early also merit special attention. Last year, we announced a pilot mentoring programme for students who leave ITE prematurely. We hope that this programme will empower them to achieve their aspirations with a positive mindset. We aim to support 100 youths over the two-year pilot."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00330,2022-03-10-T-010,330,Eric Chua,MSF will continue to work with the community to strengthen our families.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00331,2022-03-10-T-010,331,Eric Chua,"(In English)  To conclude, Madam, MSF has spoken about the suite of policies and programmes to support families with different needs. We will continue to work with the community to build resilient individuals, strong families and a caring society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00332,2022-03-10-T-010,332,Eric Chua,"Families serve as a beacon of light in our lives. It is an inspiring light that pushes us to greater heights. It is a guiding light that always leads us back if we ever take the wrong path. But it is also a comforting light that provides us with refuge whenever the going gets tough and where we need to look towards to share our joys and anxieties. Our families also serve as compasses that help us navigate through life. Families shape our values, beliefs and a sense of purpose. Through the storms of life, we need only reach into our pockets for our compass to help us all find our true north."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00333,2022-03-10-T-010,333,Eric Chua,"So, in this Year of Celebrating SG Families, let us all aim to become a bright beacon of light and a trusty compass for our families, just as they are for us. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00334,2022-03-10-T-010,334,,Clarifications? Mr Seah Kian Peng.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00335,2022-03-10-T-010,335,Seah Kian Peng,"Mdm Chairman, I have three clarifications to ask. The first is to Minister Masagos Zulkifli. First, I thank him for reiterating the importance of strengthening family resilience and his articulation of what family means. Recently, Minister K Shanmugam made a statement on section 377A of the Penal Code and the changing societal attitudes towards marriage and family. So, my first clarification to the Minister is whether he could give us the Ministry's position on this."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00336,2022-03-10-T-010,336,Seah Kian Peng,"My second clarification relates to single mothers and is addressed to Minister of State Sun Xueling. I know she is very passionate and empathetic to the stresses that single mothers face. She has explained some of the things that have been done for them. I would like to ask whether she could further elaborate on what single mothers could expect, the areas that the Ministry is looking at."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00337,2022-03-10-T-010,337,Seah Kian Peng,"And my third and final clarification is relating to ComLink, either Minister Desmond Lee or Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua could address this. We all know the importance of going upstream and the good results that ComLink has achieved so far. I note that it has already been rolled out to 11 towns and will be rolled out to 10 more soon. My question is, if resource is not a constraint and seeing the good results that have come out so far, I am sure all the 10 towns are looking forward to this. So, how can we roll this out even faster and if this could be shared with especially the 10 towns that are expecting this? What can we do to accelerate this so that we can really make a difference to the families that will benefit from this?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00338,2022-03-10-T-010,338,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I thank the Member Mr Seah Kian Peng for his three questions to open up the clarifications.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00339,2022-03-10-T-010,339,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As Minister for Home Affairs and Law Mr K Shanmugam has shared, the Government recognises that section 377A of the Penal Code is a divisive issue. The Court has acknowledged that the Government's current approach on this matter avoids driving an even deeper wedge in our society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00340,2022-03-10-T-010,340,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our society can be described as largely traditional. However, we now have a wider range of views and attitudes where families and marriage are concerned. For example, take the attitude towards mixed marriages. More than 30 years ago, one in 10 of all marriages were inter-ethnic. Today, it is doubled – almost one in five. And you see this more common, even among ourselves and our Members here, very acceptable to our society."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00341,2022-03-10-T-010,341,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We, therefore, are not surprised that we are seeing an increasing acceptance of LGBT persons socially among Singaporeans. In fact, an IPS survey in 2019 showed that while small, 11.4% of the respondents felt that sexual relations between two same-sex adults were not wrong at all. This is still double the figure in 2013, which was about 5.6%."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00342,2022-03-10-T-010,342,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But while societal attitudes are gradually shifting, the majority value and wish to preserve the traditional family – that of a man and a woman marrying and raising the child or children in a stable family unit. This was also reflected in statements, consequent to Minister K Shanmugam's statement in Parliament recently, by various parties. Family continues to be the bedrock of our society and contributes to social stability, allows children to thrive. We will uphold the traditional family in our Government policies and laws, reflecting our societal norms and values. These include marriage, parenthood, adoption, fertility treatment even, housing and inheritance, amongst others."

For instance, the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) contains a range of both civil and criminal measures that can protect all victims and is meant to protect all victims against offences involving harassment and abuse."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00344,2022-03-10-T-010,344,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From MSF, through public education campaigns, such as Break the Silence, to raise awareness and encourage victims, regardless of nationality, marital status, gender, race, religion or even sexual orientation, to seek help early. We also urge the public to step forward to report violence and abuse where LGBT cases may be involved."

It is an issue that involves deeply-held beliefs and values and divergent societal views and goals. We thank the religious, sectoral, civil society and LGBT groups that have shown support for civil dialogue and respect for the values of others, even when different from their own."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00346,2022-03-10-T-010,346,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will continue to adopt the approach of civil dialogue, working with all, involving all stakeholders as we chart our own unique Singapore way forward, without creating sudden shifts and deep divisions in our society."

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00348,2022-03-10-T-010,348,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member Mr Seah Kian Peng for his clarification. I have said this before and my views have not changed – I respect single parents, single unwed parents, for the love and care that they have for their children. And I fully recognise that it is not easy to bring up children, even more so single-handedly."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00349,2022-03-10-T-010,349,Sun Xueling,"That is why in the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships (AFAM), we have a dedicated focal area on single parents. Specifically, for the areas which we are following up on in our dialogues and engagement sessions with single unwed parents, a few areas, a few pain points, have been highlighted to us."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00350,2022-03-10-T-010,350,Sun Xueling,"Firstly, on childminding. That is why, in my main response earlier, I had talked about the childminding service pilot that MSF will be partnering a social service agency to provide childminding service beyond a regular childcare centre's operating hours. And this is important because we know that when we solve childminding issues and concerns of single parents, they then will have the capacity, the time and the energies to look into employment."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00351,2022-03-10-T-010,351,Sun Xueling,"The second area – when it comes to employment support, we are having discussions with NTUC, with community partners, to see what are the areas we can assist our single unwed parents in, be it in training or finding local opportunities for these single parents to be able to re-enter the workforce and get on a sustainable path with their children."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00352,2022-03-10-T-010,352,Sun Xueling,"The third pain point that has been highlighted to us has been around housing. In this particular area, I have had the opportunity to work with Member Mr Louis Ng for many years when we have discussed this in Parliament and in my time at the MND. Members will recall that Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim had recently shared in Parliament that, generally, single unwed parents can receive the outcome of their rental flat application within three weeks of submitting all required information, although additional time may be required for complex cases."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00353,2022-03-10-T-010,353,Sun Xueling,"These three areas – childminding, employment support, housing – have been brought up as pain points and we are actively looking at how we can solve these pain points for our single unwed parents."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00354,2022-03-10-T-010,354,Sun Xueling,"I also wanted to highlight that after the focus group discussion that my team at MSF and I had with the single unwed parents – and Members like Mr Louis Ng and other Members of Parliament had joined me for the session as well – my team had followed up individually with the single unwed parents to clarify any outstanding issues that they had raised, which sometimes also arises out of misunderstandings or miscommunications of Government policies in their interactions with Government agencies."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00355,2022-03-10-T-010,355,,Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00356,2022-03-10-T-010,356,Eric Chua,"Thank you, Mdm Chairman. I want to thank the Member for his clarification on ComLink and I also want to thank the Member for attributing the adjective ""success"" with ComLink at this point. But I do think it is a little bit premature."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00357,2022-03-10-T-010,357,Eric Chua,"We started ComLink with four sites in 2019 – Jalan Kukoh, Boon Lay, Kembangan-Chai Chee as well as Marsiling. So, we have piloted that at four sites. We thought the model worked well and that is why we are going into a two-phased approach  11 towns last year, as well as 10 towns this year."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00358,2022-03-10-T-010,358,Eric Chua,"What we are trying to achieve through ComLink is our promise in our Social Compact  to help our low-income families. This is really going for the long haul because if you look at the broad objectives of stability, self-reliance and social mobility we are talking about – and mostly, on social mobility – we are talking about long-term outcomes."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00359,2022-03-10-T-010,359,Eric Chua,"Through ComLink, we are tracking various outcomes, indicators, not just in terms of immediate process indicators, but also perception. Finally, and most importantly, in my own opinion, outcome indicators – where do the families end up?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00360,2022-03-10-T-010,360,Eric Chua,"I want to stress the fact that, actually, time or speed might not be of the essence in this scenario. Because we are talking about having a very customised, very bespoke approach to going to each family, understanding them, both their challenges that they face, as well as the aspirations and dreams that they have; and then helping them to take away, remove or sidestep some of these challenges while, at the same time, working towards their longer-term goals, their aspirations."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00361,2022-03-10-T-010,361,Eric Chua,"I do not think it is something that can be achieved overnight. You cannot get to Rome in one evening but we can most certainly do that if we adopt a whole-of-society approach – where the community, our social service agencies and the Government come together. Then, I think we have a fair chance at success for this programme."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00362,2022-03-10-T-010,362,,"I see quite a few hands. So, I am going to ask Members to please ask your questions succinctly and for the replies to also be short. Mr Gerald Giam."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00363,2022-03-10-T-010,363,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Thank you, Madam. I have some questions on the adult disability care. Is the staff-client ratio of adult disability care facilities lower than that of the teacher-student ratio at SPED schools? If so, why is there this disparity between the two? Because this is what causes the cliff effect for those who are graduating from SPED schools. And lastly, does MSF have any plans to close this gap, given that most SPED school graduates will need to attend post-18 disability care facilities?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00364,2022-03-10-T-010,364,Eric Chua,"I thank the Member for his clarification. On the first question of whether the staff ratio for the adult disability care facilities is on par with the SPED schools, I do not have the numbers for the staff ratios for SPED schools on hand at the moment. So, I cannot give a fair comparison across these two types of facilities."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00365,2022-03-10-T-010,365,Eric Chua,"On the second point about closing the gaps, I do think that what we are doing is journeying with our persons with disabilities and, as I mentioned earlier, what we have done is to, over time, where necessary, increase funding. For instance, I mentioned increased funding for our day activity centres by some 20% or $3 million last year and we have also increased funding for our adult disability homes by about 25% most recently as well."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00366,2022-03-10-T-010,366,Eric Chua,"Our intention is really to make sure that we cater for the right amount as well as the right type of services that our persons with disabilities need within the community. In terms of closing the gap, that is definitely what we hope to do. That is why in the iterations of the three Enabling Masterplan (EMP) since 2007, we have been keeping at it. We have been working on the fourth edition. As Members know now, the results and findings of which will be made known in the later part of this year. I hope that Members can look out for the announcements that we make under EMP 2030."

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00368,2022-03-10-T-010,368,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"I really appreciate Parliament Secretary Eric Chua's sincerity in working with us on the ground. I also appreciate Mr Gerald Giam's concern for persons with disabilities. My supplementary question is whether MSF would consider convening a very specific group – either you call it Alliance for Action (AfA) or any action group – that will look into the overall holistic needs of this community. Because to ask for, say, free transport or free schools is not complete. MOE, I computed, spends about $260 million a year – there are some more cohorts coming and there are a lot of adults who do not have services now. So, the amount for education alone is going to be a lot bigger. There are other needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00369,2022-03-10-T-010,369,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Rather than asking individually, I do think we need a holistic strategic study of the entire needs of the disabled, then prioritise them, cluster them, size it up, see what is needed and then look at how much can be supported by Government grants, how much can be supported by those who can afford a bit more, and those who are in the community – Temasek Foundation or Temasek Trust for that matter, which have been very helpful – and other foundations. So, look at it holistically, convene a group that will look at it as a whole, size it, compute how much is required and then see how we can actually operationalise the whole thing for sustainability and to meet the prioritised needs."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00370,2022-03-10-T-010,370,,"Ms Denise Phua, please ask your question."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00371,2022-03-10-T-010,371,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Thank you very much.

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00373,2022-03-10-T-010,373,Eric Chua,"Thanks, Mdm Chairman. Likewise, I want to thank Ms Denise Phua for her passion in this area of work, which I think is really infectious whenever she is at the EMP meetings where she brings with her great ideas as well."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00374,2022-03-10-T-010,374,Eric Chua,"I want to keep this short. We will not shun away from our responsibilities on this. That is why the Disability Office, Social Policy and Services Group (SPSG) in MSF, is there, and that is why we will continually look at these issues in totality and not just look at them from our own vantage point, but to also look at them together with our partners in the community, the social service agencies. Which is why, in today's EMP 2030 Steering Committee, we have a whole range of representations from both the people, private and public sectors. I am co-chairing that with Mr Gan Seow Kee, Vice-Chairman of SBF, and I think that is a good example of how we hope to really make a difference in this disability space for good and in a sustained fashion."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00375,2022-03-10-T-010,375,Eric Chua,"And in this latest EMP, one of the bold moves that we are making – and I am letting the cat out of the bag a little bit here – is to really fix some tangible goals for ourselves as to where we want to get to in the next few years leading up to 2030, where the endpoint of the Enabling Masterplan is. It is an endpoint, but it is, to me, just a checkpoint. Because what happens after 2030? It is the fourth, but, definitely, not the last masterplan that we will have. We will have to keep working at these issues because some of these things that we want to change in society pertain to mindsets, culture, how we maybe even react to persons with disabilities in our midst. So, there is a lot of work for us to do together and I want to give the Member the assurance that we will be keeping at this for the long haul."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00376,2022-03-10-T-010,376,,"I like the passion in the room, but I would like to please remind everyone to be succinct. Ms Carrie Tan."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00377,2022-03-10-T-010,377,Carrie Tan,"Thank you, Chairperson, I will try to keep it short. I appreciate the Ministry's efforts to increase the digitalisation efforts to make financial assistance more accessible. But given that many of the vulnerable communities are very low on their digital literacy, where they literally may not even know how to use Gmail on their phones, let alone to navigate Government portals, I would like to know what are the Ministry's efforts in trying to bridge this digital literacy gap and, if the befrienders from ComLink are meant to also support them on this front, then what are the ways that the Ministry might be looking at empowering befrienders and giving them the necessary access and safeguards around PDPA to support ComCare beneficiaries for their online applications?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00378,2022-03-10-T-010,378,Carrie Tan,"Secondly, given that the process of climbing out of poverty tends to be a long one and it is not a matter of bouncing back, will the Ministry consider automatic extension of ComCare to short-term financial assistance recipients, given that, right now, it presents a disincentive to some of them attaining jobs with the uncertainty and prospect that they may lose financial assistance upon getting a job? So, would that not be a way to reduce the administrative load of the Ministry and, at the same time, helping to reduce the bandwidth tax on applicants?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00379,2022-03-10-T-010,379,,Minister Desmond Lee.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00380,2022-03-10-T-010,380,Desmond Lee,"Let me address the Member's first question. The SupportGoWhere portal provides a digital enabler to help families to navigate support schemes and to be able to make the applications digitally. But we are mindful that many of our clients, including seniors, are more comfortable face-to-face, maybe on the phone, and befrienders will be a big plus. And so, all that remains – in fact, that remains core – because, in this line of work, in social service delivery, it is high-touch, high-feel. It is really an emotional connection. But a digital platform adds another layer of support."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00381,2022-03-10-T-010,381,Desmond Lee,"Even in the real-world space, I have described earlier streamlined action protocols, One Client View (OneCV) and Case Connect working in the backend to enable organisations to work around the client's needs and their families, even as the client approaches the Social Services Office (SSO) physically. And for clients who approach the SSO, way before COVID-19 or just before COVID-19, we had already put in place video conferencing capacities to enable a client of the SSO to communicate not just with the SSO officer physically, but virtually be able to link-up with the HDB officer and, of course, with other agencies as well. So, that remains an important way to support those who may not be so digitally-inclined to seek help that way."

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00383,2022-03-10-T-010,383,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I just want to assure Ms Carrie Tan that we do not want a cliff effect and disincentivise someone from graduating. We are not there to kick people out of ComCare, or get them out of ComCare because we just do not want to give them support. We want to enable them and, as mentioned in my speech, if Ms Carrie Tan has heard carefully, the SSOs are given discretion to continue support even after the person has found, for example, a job, a better job, a better paying job, and not suffer this cliff effect that we may have, inadvertently, through our policy, done in the past. This is not how we are going to go forward."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00384,2022-03-10-T-010,384,,Mr Don Wee.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00385,2022-03-10-T-010,385,Don Wee,"Thank you, Mdm Chairman. I have three questions. Minister Masagos Zulkifli mentioned that, through ComLink, there will be a proactive approach to appear at deserving residents' doorsteps. So, I guess the lower-hanging fruits at this moment will be the existing clients in the SSO systems as well as there are also likely to be referrals from the Family Service Centres of ComCare recipients. So, my question is, can the potential pool of clients be expanded to beneficiaries of the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), MediFund as well as the various self-help groups like SINDA, MENDAKI or CDAC? So, by doing so, their application process must have a housing type and identifier in the application process. And it will also mean that system requirements will be required."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00386,2022-03-10-T-010,386,Don Wee,"Second question. Along the same vein, relating to the app which allows clients to apply for various schemes, I guess this is like the Municipal Services Office (MSO) OneService app equivalent for less-privileged Singaporeans. So, over time, I hope the app can also allow these clients to apply for schemes offered by the self-help groups and the ComChest accredited Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs)."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00387,2022-03-10-T-010,387,Don Wee,"Third question. I also welcome the various improvements, like OneClientView, the single means-testing approach, as well as the tele-counselling which expedites the application turnaround time. So, to improve the handshake process further, can we also explore co-locating SSOs as well as the Family Service Centres, or SSAs, in future because the newer rental precincts do not come with spacious void decks these days."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00388,2022-03-10-T-010,388,Don Wee,"Lastly, I would also like to thank the —"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00389,2022-03-10-T-010,389,,"Thank you, Mr Don Wee, you have asked quite a lot of questions. I want to leave time for others. Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00390,2022-03-10-T-010,390,Eric Chua,"Thank you, Mdm Chairman. I also want to thank the Member for his three clarifications. First, on expanding beyond the existing pool that we have identified to include those from self-help groups, schools, FAS and whatnot, I am mindful that we already have 14,000 families identified for this year and the next. We do want to focus on them. I would say that let us focus on these 14,000 families because a bespoke and customised approach has to be had for each of these families. So, I do not think it is something that we want to take lightly. And once we are on a steady state with the existing 14,000 families, we will want to move on to as many other families that we can assist as possible. So, that is for first question."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00391,2022-03-10-T-010,391,Eric Chua,"For the second question, the answer is we will take a look at that and we will, gradually, progressively, evolve what we can provide in the technology and in the app."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00392,2022-03-10-T-010,392,Eric Chua,"The third question relates to the co-location of the different institutions, SSOs, FSCs and all that. We have piloted that at Kreta Ayer and Bukit Merah and we have co-located the SSO and FST. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Social and Family Development"", Official Report, 10 March 2022, Vol 95, Issue No 58, Correction by Written Statement section.]"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00393,2022-03-10-T-010,393,Eric Chua,"We have also co-located SSO and AIC in Bedok and also in Tampines Hub. So, these are some examples. As we evolve the delivery of social services, we can look at how we can actually co-locate some of our services as well."

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00395,2022-03-10-T-010,395,Joan Pereira,"Thanks, Mdm Chairman. I have two clarifications. On the topic of preschool accessibility, I am very glad that Sengkang and Punggol will have more preschool places. Dawson, which I serve, also has many young families. So, I hope and look forward to more preschool centres there."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00396,2022-03-10-T-010,396,Joan Pereira,"Second clarification, can the Ministry consider my proposal to have active reach-outs to families which have been on the waiting list for about three to six months? I hope the Ministry can reach out to them, understand their needs and help them register in a nearby centre with a vacancy, because I know most parents and grandparents will want to put their charges at a centre near their homes."

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00398,2022-03-10-T-010,398,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her clarification. With the injection of new BTOs in the Dawson area, Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has planned new centres, as well as extension of existing centres, to increase preschool places to address the increase in demand. I also want to make a general point that, for other New Towns or some of the older estates where there are new insertions of BTOs, ECDA"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00399,2022-03-10-T-010,399,Sun Xueling,"On the Member's second question, currently, parents may register their interest in a preschool via the Preschool Search Portal, which is an online self-help portal. On this portal, parents can actually search by proximity, understand more about which are the centres that are available, what is the waitlist situation like."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00400,2022-03-10-T-010,400,Sun Xueling,"Every three months, the portal will inform the parents about the latest situation around the preschool places. And if the Member is aware of specific instances whereby the parent is still unable to locate a preschool which is suitable for the family and the child, to please highlight the situation to myself, to ECDA, and we will follow up closely to find a preschool which, hopefully, the parents can accept."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00401,2022-03-10-T-010,401,Sun Xueling,"Sometimes, parents can have their specific requirements around specific preschools. They may sometimes want a specific preschool within a specific walking distance from home and we will try very much to accommodate. So, on a national level, in terms of preschool capacity, we have enough, but we recognise that, in localised areas, there may be areas with higher demand and, when that happens, ECDA will work closely with the parents and the advisor there to help those young families living in those areas."

2022-03-10-T-010-S-00404,2022-03-10-T-010,404,Leon Perera,"Firstly, would the Ministry consider the proposal contained in my Budget speech to set a poverty line and measure the number of families, particularly, the number of children, who fall below this line every year so that we can measure how we are making an impact on the issue of poverty and transitioning people out of poverty? I note that some other countries do publish this data."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00405,2022-03-10-T-010,405,Leon Perera,"Secondly, on the quantum of financial assistance, how often is this reviewed? When will the next review be and do these reviews take into consideration new research, such as the study by Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe that I referred to?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00406,2022-03-10-T-010,406,Leon Perera,"Lastly, a narrow clarification. The Minister referred to our intergenerational social mobility being better than North America and Europe, if I heard him correctly. Could the Minister reference what is the study that demonstrates that? Because I am not aware of that."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00407,2022-03-10-T-010,407,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I will try to answer that in three minutes.
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00408,2022-03-10-T-010,408,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Firstly, the data that talks about social mobility. This came from a study. The source is Chetty et al, 2014, and the authors are from the US, UK, Denmark; and our own estimates are updated by the authors using administrative data. The US is about 7.5% for the share of individuals who reach the top income quintile among those born to the bottom quintile. So, 7.5% and that is North America. For the UK, it is about 9%; Europe, 11%. In Singapore, it is maintained at about 14%, especially for those that we have estimated for the 1985 to 1989 cohorts. This is published, as I mentioned, by Chetty et al, from the US, UK, Denmark, Canada; the authors are from these countries."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00409,2022-03-10-T-010,409,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For the other issue on the publication by the academicians, particularly around what the Member called minimum income standards, this was responded to by MOF in October, giving its views about the minimum income standards. This was a study started in the United Kingdom in 2006. So, it is a relatively new approach in determining what are the benchmarks and standards to look at in alleviating poverty."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00410,2022-03-10-T-010,410,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For this particular standard, the idea is to determine what incomes different household types require to reach a socially acceptable living standard. It has nothing to do with determining what low-income families should get."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00411,2022-03-10-T-010,411,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As such, even the Singapore study reflects the processes and outcomes expected from the study by the UK condition and do not necessarily reflect the needs of the low-income households."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00412,2022-03-10-T-010,412,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, the call for $1,600 monthly income for a single or partnered household includes private enrichment classes, jewellery, perfume and therefore, in no way reflects what should be, at least, the basic necessity that we should meet for needy income households."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00413,2022-03-10-T-010,413,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nonetheless, I will respect that this is an approach, a particular academic approach, and like the UK exercise, it should be seen as a reflection of what society aspires everyone to have for them, like what they want to have at least for themselves. Nonetheless, there are many other academic approaches to social spending. These include those around measuring outcomes on social mobility, like the publication I mentioned just now, as well as issues around social inclusion."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00414,2022-03-10-T-010,414,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In Singapore, for example, we make sure social inclusion is something we work very hard on. Hawker centres are a very good example where the rich and poor dine together under a community hall and they do not feel rich, do not feel poor. In the same way too, community clubs, even our housing estates, are designed for that."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00415,2022-03-10-T-010,415,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"There are other studies which talk about how it should be done. For example, raising average incomes, building pathways for continuous improvement. These two studies that I have mentioned by the academics —"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00416,2022-03-10-T-010,416,,"Minister, if you can wrap up, please."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00417,2022-03-10-T-010,417,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Yes. Put emphasis on personal responsibility, the role of the family and not just Government intervention. So, I hope that we do not get fixated by a publication, as popular as it is, but look at the broad literature and the outcomes that we have achieved so far."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00418,2022-03-10-T-010,418,,"Mr Seah Kian Peng, if you can withdraw your amendment, please?"
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00419,2022-03-10-T-010,419,Seah Kian Peng,"Chairman, I would first like to thank Minister Masagos Zulkifli, Minister Desmond Lee, Minister of State Sun Xueling and Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua for their responses to our cuts and also their subsequent responses to our clarifications."
2022-03-10-T-010-S-00420,2022-03-10-T-010,420,Seah Kian Peng,"Renewing and strengthening our social compact to build a fair and just Singapore require the work and support of all of us. Certainly, for those in the social sector, I think they are doing a lot of heavy lifting on this front. So, on behalf of all of us, inside and outside of this House, I want to express our sincere appreciation to all of them. On that note, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment."

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00426,2022-03-10-T-011,426,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, MCCY shoulders the heavy responsibility of safeguarding the social compact that we have assiduously built in Singapore over the years – the unwavering belief and determination to work together to build towards a collective future regardless of race, language, culture or religion."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00427,2022-03-10-T-011,427,Sitoh Yih Pin,This social compact amongst Singaporeans forms the bedrock that has enabled us to overcome many challenges faced in nation-building over the years. Our unity and strength in diversity is a unique part of our social fabric that is vital to the survival and progress of Singapore.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00428,2022-03-10-T-011,428,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis brought out the very best of our Singapore community. We have seen the bravery and sacrifices of our frontline teams and heard of anecdotal stories of neighbours and friends within communities caring for and reaching out to one another in these challenging times."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00429,2022-03-10-T-011,429,Sitoh Yih Pin,"But, Sir, on the other hand, as a result of the pandemic, we have also observed the polarisation of some societies along the lines of socio-economic status, race and nationality. Despite our strong social compact, Singapore has not been spared."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00430,2022-03-10-T-011,430,Sitoh Yih Pin,"We have seen racist incidents, vocal discussions on the treatment of low-wage workers and attitudes towards foreigners. Some of the incidents gained widespread publicity, amplified through social media and other online platforms. Such issues are highly emotive in nature and can easily serve to divide us, if not carefully managed. It is a timely reminder that we cannot take social harmony in Singapore for granted."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00431,2022-03-10-T-011,431,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, I do believe, however, that the current discourse over race and religion as well as foreigners and jobs, can be useful if discussed in a constructive and respectful manner. It can also prompt a deeper reflection about our values and what it means to be Singaporean."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00432,2022-03-10-T-011,432,Sitoh Yih Pin,"We must, however, exercise ample deliberation in managing the discourse. We must remember that we did not build the social compact we have where we enjoy racial and religious harmony overnight and it, certainly, did not happen by chance. It took generations of effort, understanding, compromise and reaching out to grow the common spaces we share in order to attain what we have. It is a precious commodity that we must not freely give up."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00433,2022-03-10-T-011,433,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, as we move towards the future, we can expect these issues to continue to be discussed. In the TODAY Youth Survey published in November last year, it is clear that our youths are progressively seized with and are inclined to speak their minds on issues such as race and religion."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00434,2022-03-10-T-011,434,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Our demographic is also slowly moving in a different direction. Over the past 10 years, approximately one in five marriages has been between couples with different ethnicity and/or race. With this trend, it will mean that there will be a whole segment of the next generation of Singaporeans born of these marriages who will also join in the discussions of race and religion but from a wholly different perspective."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00435,2022-03-10-T-011,435,Sitoh Yih Pin,"We are, therefore, likely to grow into a more diverse society in the future. And while that will mean that more voices will need to be heard, it will, hopefully, make us a more robust, culturally richer and enduring society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00436,2022-03-10-T-011,436,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I, therefore, invite the Minister to share MCCY's strategies to ensure that Singapore remains a caring and inclusive society where we care for one another, where everyone's voices are heard and where our shared beliefs unite and drive us as a nation in the years to come."

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00438,2022-03-10-T-011,438,,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin. You can take your three cuts together.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00439,2022-03-10-T-011,439,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Thank you, Chairman."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00440,2022-03-10-T-011,440,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Since the M3 network was established some years ago, we are now in a better position to understand how our outreach efforts can be coordinated to enhance our community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00441,2022-03-10-T-011,441,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Organisations and agencies have adopted a collaborative attitude to achieve better outcomes for the people. However, there are still residents in rental units facing multigenerational issues, and this hinders their aspirations to achieve a better life."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00442,2022-03-10-T-011,442,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Last year, the Government launched Project DIAN@M3 in Geylang Serai, Bedok and Jalan Besar."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00443,2022-03-10-T-011,443,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,What are the best practices learnt in terms of volunteer engagement and data sharing that have led to better collaboration among agencies in helping families living in rental units?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00444,2022-03-10-T-011,444,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,How can we coordinate and work more closely with Malay/Muslim organisations that are actively helping the residents in order to avoid duplication of efforts?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00445,2022-03-10-T-011,445,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for Project DIAN@M3 in reaching out to our community over the next decade?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00446,2022-03-10-T-011,446,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In Cheng San-Seletar, my team of volunteers run a research project to better understand the needs of families which have an incarcerated family member. More often than not, these offenders are the sole breadwinner, like the father, husband or son."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00447,2022-03-10-T-011,447,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Incarceration is something that can impact the institution of family. Although the offender was the one being incarcerated, his family members are also affected. Usually, the assistance or support given to the offender's family only comes at the beginning or the end of the offender's sentence."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00448,2022-03-10-T-011,448,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"If we look at it, usually at the beginning of the offender's sentence, the offender's family may not feel desperate for daily needs. However, as time goes by, the offenders' families may feel trapped and depressed. If we are not careful, other family members can be affected, too. Efforts, such as reintegration support for offenders and families should be stepped up. I would like to ask how many families have been helped by FITRAH."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00449,2022-03-10-T-011,449,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Can FITRAH monitor and identify any multigenerational problems in the family, and how does FITRAH help those families?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00450,2022-03-10-T-011,450,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Are there plans to coordinate efforts and assistance for the family, not only at the beginning or the end of the prison sentence, but also for the entire incarceration period, so that the families of the offenders are not neglected?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00451,2022-03-10-T-011,451,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"More families are facing complex issues such as mental health and teenage pregnancies, and there is a need for FITRAH to mobilise volunteers to help these families. So, how can the FITRAH structure be strengthened for the long term so that this effort can continue?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00452,2022-03-10-T-011,452,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] When I was given the opportunity to serve in MENDAKI's Committee on The Future Economy, we surveyed our students to understand how we can support their aspirations and ensure that they have a place and role in the future economy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00453,2022-03-10-T-011,453,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"When asked where they received career advice, students from madrasahs and secular schools shared that they usually asked their parents and relatives, although schools now have education and career counsellors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00454,2022-03-10-T-011,454,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"While family advice is important, our young people in this generation are growing up in a different era and economy where job and education opportunities are very much different, compared to 20 years ago."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00455,2022-03-10-T-011,455,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I would like to ask whether the Government employs a strategic approach to support the students' capability and development, and increase opportunities for them to obtain scholarships to enhance their skills in new growth areas."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00456,2022-03-10-T-011,456,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Apart from preparing students with skills even while they are still school, how can MENDAKI work with companies and industries to support the transition to new growth areas?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00457,2022-03-10-T-011,457,,Ms Mariam Jaafar. You can take both cuts together.

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00459,2022-03-10-T-011,459,Mariam Jaafar,Can the Government give an update on the M3 youth mentoring programmes and the value derived from these programmes in the eyes of the mentees? What is the demand for these mentoring programmes and how much of the demand is being fulfilled? How quickly can the programmes be extended to ITE and Polytechnic students?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00460,2022-03-10-T-011,460,Mariam Jaafar,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The number of Malay families living in rental housing cited in the latest population survey is something that has been noted. At the same time, we know that many families in public rental flats aspire to become homeowners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00461,2022-03-10-T-011,461,Mariam Jaafar,"Can M3 provide an update on the KPIs for Project DIAN@M3, what has been achieved to date and how the Government can also extend more support to other vulnerable families which do not own a home, but do not reside in rental flats, for example, renting a room/unit in the open market, staying temporarily with friends or family, or are homeless?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00462,2022-03-10-T-011,462,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,(
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00463,2022-03-10-T-011,463,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"However, to achieve further success, we have to look at the gaps and challenges before us and try to find solutions for each one. The Malay community is known for its ""gotong royong"" spirit. They are good at uniting their efforts. Nonetheless, as the world is changing rapidly, we also need to learn from others to gain new knowledge and skills to overcome the current challenges. As the Malay proverb goes, whenever it floods, the shoreline changes shape, that is, when a major change takes place, everything else will change, too. So, while many people may be happy to just swim in a small pond, the Malay community now aspires to swim in the ocean. However, there is also another proverb cautioning us that if our fishing line is short, do not test the ocean, that is, if we do not have the capacity, do not attempt something beyond our capabilities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00464,2022-03-10-T-011,464,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"A rapidly changing world has impacted on our stability and traditional sources of income. Careers that used to provide stable employment are now facing challenges and becoming scarce. These careers have been replaced by new forms of jobs that change quickly and this requires us to be nimble and adaptable to ensure a stable income. Our workforce is challenged by stiff competition from foreign workers flooding into our country, hungry for job opportunities that are increasingly becoming scarce in their own countries."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00465,2022-03-10-T-011,465,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Mr Chairman, in terms of monthly income, the Malay community is lagging behind. The 2020 Population Census showed that the average monthly household income from work was $6,851 in 2020 and the median level was $5,704 which is the lowest, compared to the Chinese, Indian and other communities, and, furthermore, 37.1% of Malays are living in 3-room, 2-room and 1-room flats."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00466,2022-03-10-T-011,466,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, although I would like to touch on a number of things in this speech, due to time constraints, I will focus on one basic and important aspect in achieving progress and development in any society, which is education."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00467,2022-03-10-T-011,467,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Organisations tasked to address this challenge must ensure that they have made appropriate and sufficient preparations. Hence, improvements must take a two-pronged approach. First, by identifying jobs that will provide the most opportunities for our community right now and in the future. Second, by identifying the community's inclinations and strengths, so that any necessary preparations and adaptations can take place now in order to prepare us for a work environment that has changed and will change in the future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00468,2022-03-10-T-011,468,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,All this will certainly influence the focus of our education in the future. A focus on education that prepares our children in navigating future challenges must be emphasised. Forward-thinking education should be the basis of their curriculum and any exposure that they have to undergo should be future-realistic.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00469,2022-03-10-T-011,469,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"We also need to find new ways to help Malay students excel in innovation and creativity, in Islamic finance which is being increasingly accepted in the global market including fintech, pharmaceuticals, robotics with its sophisticated use of nanotechnology and green technology, which are the bases of the new and future economy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00470,2022-03-10-T-011,470,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"For these new fields, we also need the expertise of religious scholars to enlighten the community on matters that require our involvement. As such, I would like to ask the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs the following questions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00471,2022-03-10-T-011,471,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Firstly, what are the Government's plans to enable more young Malays to enter these new fields by 2025? I hope that the Minister and MENDAKI will share these plans, so that the Malay community knows the direction they need to take in this rapidly-changing world."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00472,2022-03-10-T-011,472,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I would also like to ask what are MUIS' plans to equip our asatizahs with the knowledge and expertise in the areas of fintech, pharmaceuticals, robotics and green technology? The community needs to know if there are any asatizahs in leadership who are knowledgeable in these fields and, at the same time, able to delve deeper into Islamic jurisprudence and syariah issues. I would also like to know how the Malay community can learn from the current asatizahs who are experts on these issues."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00473,2022-03-10-T-011,473,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Mr Chairman, our young Malays are increasingly getting excellent results in the ""O"" and ""A"" Level examinations, as well as in their studies at the local Universities. These include madrasah students who obtained distinctions despite being burdened with a much higher number of subjects compared to their peers in secular schools. This shows that there are young Malays with huge potential who need to be given the full attention, assistance and support."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00474,2022-03-10-T-011,474,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Besides the increase in the number of Malay students in local Universities, there is also a growing number of young Malays who are furthering their studies at the Bachelor's degree or postgraduate level in foreign universities. In future, with the world changing rapidly and new fields of knowledge being created, there will be more Malay students who may want to gain knowledge and experience in institutions of higher learning overseas. I hope MENDAKI can enhance its overseas study loan scheme in terms of the loan quantum and also by including many more new fields. This is to ensure that our Malay students' ambitions and aspirations are not hindered due to financial matters."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00475,2022-03-10-T-011,475,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In this regard, I have some questions for the Minister. Over the past 10 years, firstly, how many Malay students have received assistance through the overseas Study Loan Scheme provided by MENDAKI every year? Second, how many of these students who received assistance had their loan scheme converted into scholarships due to their excellent results? Third, what is the average loan amount given out by MENDAKI every year? Fourth, how many postgraduate students did MENDAKI assist over the last 10 years so that they can take their Master's and PhD in overseas universities? And, finally, what is the average loan amount channelled to overseas graduate students every year?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00476,2022-03-10-T-011,476,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Going forward, the Malay community would like to know clearly whether there is a masterplan by MENDAKI to propel the Malay community forward, in line with the demands of IR 4.0."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00477,2022-03-10-T-011,477,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, at the beginning of my speech, I spoke about achieving progress in both religious and secular fields. I shared my views on how we can further strengthen efforts to continue our progress by expanding educational fields and knowledge to keep up with the changing times. Before I end my speech, I would like to touch on current developments that we must pay attention to, especially by Muslims in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00478,2022-03-10-T-011,478,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, the Muslim community's progress does not depend solely on the development and improvements in education. It also depends on efforts to do good and, at the same time, endeavours to help Muslims follow Islamic values more closely."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00479,2022-03-10-T-011,479,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Last January, the Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (PERGAS) issued a statement via social media platforms Facebook and Instagram that they will form a task force on the issue of LGBT, or Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders in Singapore. Some of the plans made by PERGAS include a dialogue with members of the LGBT community who are Muslims, and efforts to help and guide Muslims in Singapore in facing and addressing the LGBT issue together."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00480,2022-03-10-T-011,480,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, in this regard, I would like to state that I am fully appreciative of this effort by PERGAS and I will certainly support any effort that takes a positive and enlightened approach in discussing and navigating the LGBT issue."

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00483,2022-03-10-T-011,483,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I am also excited about the School Readiness Class (KSS) programme announced last year. KMM and KSS are effective because they are not only meant for our children, but their parents as well."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00484,2022-03-10-T-011,484,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,A KMM participant in Chua Chu Kang told me that the programme gives her confidence when teaching Mathematics to her child.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00485,2022-03-10-T-011,485,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,This is encouraging because many parents participating in the programme come from low-income families and may not be highly educated.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00486,2022-03-10-T-011,486,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,What is the latest update on the achievements of the KSS and KMM programmes and to what extent has the ECDA-led KidStart programme been able to complement the KSS and KMM programmes for Malay/Muslim families?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00487,2022-03-10-T-011,487,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Educational assistance is not just for children, but also for parents in their lifelong learning. So, what are the efforts to improve lifelong learning for young couples and workers in our community?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00488,2022-03-10-T-011,488,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Singapore Community Wakaf (WMS) was announced in 2020 to generate a sustainable income to support the long-term needs of our community which includes religious institutions, asatizah development and community programmes. An Advisory Panel has been set up to review the necessary steps for the wakaf."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00489,2022-03-10-T-011,489,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In March last year, following my Parliamentary Question on WMS, we were informed that the Advisory Panel has submitted its recommendations and Minister Masagos Zulkifli also explained that, apart from the submitted recommendations, the Government also needs to study various other aspects to refine the general approach on wakaf. And this includes considering proposed amendments to existing laws."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00490,2022-03-10-T-011,490,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,The last wakaf was made more than 40 years ago – in 1978.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00491,2022-03-10-T-011,491,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Here, I agree that we need to restore the spirit and culture of endowing property for the benefit of society and nation, as those before us had done in the past, which helped established many of our religious institutions and welfare bodies through wakaf."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00492,2022-03-10-T-011,492,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"To achieve this objective, I had proposed in my previous Parliamentary speech that we need to establish a holistic ecosystem, including a more comprehensive dispute resolution framework and a public awareness campaign, on estate planning. Our community needs to be prepared for a rainy day. I hope WMS can trigger a positive change in our community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00493,2022-03-10-T-011,493,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, can the Minister provide an update on the establishment of WMS and its plans, moving forward, to further encourage the practice of wakaf in Singapore?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00494,2022-03-10-T-011,494,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Can the Government also consider setting up a dedicated department in the Syariah Court or MUIS to hear any disputes related to the issue of Muslim inheritance, including wakaf?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00495,2022-03-10-T-011,495,,Dr Shahira Abdullah. You may take your three cuts together.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00496,2022-03-10-T-011,496,Shahira Abdullah,(
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00497,2022-03-10-T-011,497,Shahira Abdullah,"Recently, a descendent of Haji Pitchay Meerah Hussain claimed mismanagement of his grandfather's wakaf land. MUIS later explained that wakif's wishes are being respected and that the broader intention has been fulfilled."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00498,2022-03-10-T-011,498,Shahira Abdullah,"As such, I would also like to know what MUIS' efforts are in educating the public regarding wakaf and whether input is being sought from the community on how the wakaf assets are being used. This is because I believe that, by doing so, it would put the Muslim community's mind at ease and may encourage the community to contribute further to the fund. Likewise, may I know what are MUIS' plans to grow and invest the fund?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00499,2022-03-10-T-011,499,Shahira Abdullah,Would the Minister also consider introducing a similar concept for the rest of society to consider endowing their assets to charitable perpetual uses?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00500,2022-03-10-T-011,500,Shahira Abdullah,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] It can be difficult for families in need to navigate the social support systems to get timely and holistic help or to gain access to national initiatives that may benefit them. Malay/Muslim Organisations can also play a part in helping to complement and support these initiatives. For example, MENDAKI had loaned out laptops to students who were awaiting approval for new ones under the NEU-PC Plus Programme when students had to suddenly pivot to home-based learning (HBL)."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00501,2022-03-10-T-011,501,Shahira Abdullah,"The Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (LBKM), which has many institutional MMO members, could also galvanise community efforts in relation to education upliftment."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00502,2022-03-10-T-011,502,Shahira Abdullah,"Likewise, the Malay Heritage Foundation has championed cultural heritage and preservation and engaged in active dialogue to recognise some of Singapore's cultural stalwarts, like the late Mr Sarkasi Said."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00503,2022-03-10-T-011,503,Shahira Abdullah,"How can the Malay/Muslim organisations synergise, support and complement other national initiatives?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00504,2022-03-10-T-011,504,Shahira Abdullah,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] On 24 February 2020, the Committee of Future Asatizah (COFA) released its recommendations to help asatizahs take their place as leaders and professionals, able to contexualise their religious knowledge to tackle issues and guiding the Muslim community here."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00505,2022-03-10-T-011,505,Shahira Abdullah,"One of the programmes introduced was RLTD. May I ask what the programme is doing to groom the asatizahs to fill the different leadership positions not just in religious institutions but in the adjacent sectors as well? The religious knowledge asatizahs have is important in providing expertise and guidance in non-religious sectors as well, benefiting not just the Muslim community but the wider community, too."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00506,2022-03-10-T-011,506,Shahira Abdullah,"I would also like to know the progress into the common salary guidelines in religious institutions. I hope, with the important, sincere work that they do, they are renumerated appropriately to attract as well as to retain talent."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00507,2022-03-10-T-011,507,Shahira Abdullah,"How are the salaries benchmarked against relevant sectors and what is the pay progression like as they upskill and upgrade? At the same time, how are we galvanising the community to support this pay progression as well?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00508,2022-03-10-T-011,508,Shahira Abdullah,"Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic saw the need for our religious teachers to quickly pivot and adapt to ensure that religious classes and programmes could still be carried out to benefit the Muslim community. I would like to commend them for their efforts. It also raises the issue that, in addition to the continual need to upgrade religious knowledge, non-typical skills upgrading is also needed to keep up with changes that happen in society. May I know the updates and how ARS is doing this on their CPE platform to better address and respond to these changing needs?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00509,2022-03-10-T-011,509,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00510,2022-03-10-T-011,510,Rahayu Mahzam,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In a discourse written by Mufti Dr Naziruddin Nasir, which was published by Berita Harian last year, he wrote about the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, when we grappled with confusion and uncertainty on how to balance religious obligations and public safety. However, our religious and community leaders did not let the confusion hamper us and proceeded to guide the Muslim community in Singapore. Indeed, contemporary issues bring new challenges. As a minority Muslim community, we often face unique and multiple challenges to thrive in a non-Muslim majority society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00511,2022-03-10-T-011,511,Rahayu Mahzam,"The International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS), which is being planned, is a meaningful platform for the minority Muslim community in Singapore to learn about the efforts of other communities in navigating contemporary issues. MUIS organised two pre-conference sessions last year. We must ensure that ICCOS can benefit the Singapore Muslim community and help other efforts in the religious sector. Can MUIS give details of the key objectives and expected outcomes from ICCOS?"

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00513,2022-03-10-T-011,513,Abdul Samad,"I would like to ask the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs if he could share the progress rate of our community in education over the past decade or past five years and how many people within our community have graduated from ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities? Does the Government also monitor how many from this cohort of ITE and diploma holders have progressed and attained a degree or higher? What are the sectors that have the least participation from our community and how do we, as a community, raise interest in those sectors so that we can seize the available opportunities?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00514,2022-03-10-T-011,514,Abdul Samad,Another group that is of concern to me is the madrasah cohort. How do we track the number of students that have graduated from religious universities across different parts of the Middle East? How has this group of graduates integrated with our multi-racial society? Could the Minister also share how does the salary package for our religious teachers or scholars compare with those teaching in secular schools? How are they benchmarked and how often are they being reviewed for their compensation?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00515,2022-03-10-T-011,515,Abdul Samad,"I always believe that our asatizahs have to be paid competitively, or even higher, in view of the knowledge they impart and the guidance they provide to our community for this world and the hereafter. I call on all my fellow Muslims to come forward and contribute, if a fund is needed to further develop and enhance the performance of our asatizahs and religious scholars. I believe that our religious teachers always have a strong aspiration to be intellectuals and scholars who that are able to innovate and shape policies in our multiracial and multi-cultural society based on Islamic principles that respect each different faith, value and culture."

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00518,2022-03-10-T-011,518,Wan Rizal,This exists because we have an efficient madrasah education system.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00519,2022-03-10-T-011,519,Wan Rizal,I am grateful and proud that we can see progress in our students.

The uncertainties brought forth by the pandemic would mean that we need to support our youths within and beyond the classroom. I am heartened to note that some programmes are already in place to assist your youths and the community, such as MENDAKI's Empowerment Programmes."

Employment opportunities continuously evolve and work from home or other flexible work arrangements are becoming the norm in some industries."

This category usually gets a better salary. Statistics also show that a large number of Malay/Muslim women who are married or had married previously are not economically active and are an untapped labour group. We also have a shortage of Malay workers in certain sectors such as tech financing, green financing, banking, as well as in the developing sectors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00564,2022-03-10-T-011,564,Saktiandi Supaat,"So, our goal must not only be to get more people within our community into permanent jobs and to ensure that they can be upskilled to get better jobs with higher wages and job security, but to work in the developing sectors in future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00565,2022-03-10-T-011,565,Saktiandi Supaat,Various initiatives are already underway to build a competent and future-ready workforce among the Malay/Muslim community.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00566,2022-03-10-T-011,566,Saktiandi Supaat,"One example is the agreement which was signed by NTUC and Yayasan MENDAKI on 24 February 2022. Another example is M3, which leads many initiatives, including organising career fairs and providing training and career advice."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00567,2022-03-10-T-011,567,Saktiandi Supaat,"What is the Government's thinking on streamlining our efforts to build a competent, future-ready workforce in the Malay/Muslim community? Are there specific detailed efforts to reallocate and concentrate more Malay/Muslim talent, both young and mature, in emerging growth sectors, such as through permanent internship opportunities and sectoral level scholarships with various corporations? We must have sectoral focus and have a deeper collaboration with the private sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00568,2022-03-10-T-011,568,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In English)  We will also need to focus on cultivating a culture of learning and upskilling within the Malay/Muslim community. While the take-up rate is increasing, only 8.4% of Malay workers had utilised the SkillsFuture Credit scheme between 2015 and 2020."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00569,2022-03-10-T-011,569,Saktiandi Supaat,I have a few suggestions on that front.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00570,2022-03-10-T-011,570,Saktiandi Supaat,"First, we can tie up career sharing programmes with other initiatives. I recently had the opportunity to visit a clinic where Lawyers@M³ executed Lasting Power of Attorney for my residents. We could perhaps wrap in a sharing on mid-career switch to lawyering, which can reach the applicants, as well as their children who accompanied them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00571,2022-03-10-T-011,571,Saktiandi Supaat,"Second, we can encourage our Malay/Muslim workers, especially the younger ones, to be adaptable and to try new things. Our workers should be encouraged to venture abroad, through overseas secondments and training opportunities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00572,2022-03-10-T-011,572,Saktiandi Supaat,"Third, we can facilitate interaction and cross-pollination of ideas between the Malay/Muslim workforce and the rest of the workforce, among Chinese, Indian and Malay Chambers and with corporates. There are areas where the community has subject matter expertise, for example, Islamic finance, which some of my Chinese and European colleagues are also interested to learn more. By teaching, one can reinforce his or her understanding and expertise in a particular area as well."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00573,2022-03-10-T-011,573,Saktiandi Supaat,"No matter the specific initiatives we implement, we ought to have a coordinated approach to help our Malay/Muslim workers develop into a competent, future-ready workforce."

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00575,2022-03-10-T-011,575,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Chairman, I would like to thank the Members for their cuts. My speech in Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00576,2022-03-10-T-011,576,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] When Singapore became independent in 1965, many had thought that we would not survive. But we were not deterred. To ensure our survival, the Government's priority was to ensure access to affordable education, housing and healthcare. This became the bedrock for us to build strong families and caring communities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00577,2022-03-10-T-011,577,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Even after more than five decades, our Singapore story continues to centre around a shared vision of a society that provides opportunities for all, regardless of race, language or religion. We were united and worked as one to uplift the lives of Singaporeans, including our Malay/Muslim community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00578,2022-03-10-T-011,578,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Census of Population 2020 has shown significant progress in education and household income for the Malay community when compared with 10 years ago. More Malay workers were also employed in fast-growing sectors such as information and communications, as well as financial and insurance services. I am heartened by this as it reflects the good progress of our education and employment outcomes over the decades."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00579,2022-03-10-T-011,579,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In the past few years, I have spoken about the three ""C""s that make us a Community of Success – character, competence and citizenry. This year, I will focus on the development of our competencies, even as we build on our achievements to propel the community towards further success. This will be done through three key strategies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00580,2022-03-10-T-011,580,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Firstly, reinforcing the network of care through M3; second, partnering the community and industry in building a competent workforce; and third, shaping a competent religious sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00581,2022-03-10-T-011,581,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While our economic progress has benefited many Singaporeans, it has also given rise to new challenges, particularly towards the vulnerable. Rising social inequality has become a common concern for many advanced economies. Such situations make it easy for new fault lines to emerge between different segments of society and threaten our social cohesion. In Singapore, we can avoid such a situation if we continue to ensure that social mobility remains alive."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00582,2022-03-10-T-011,582,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, for the vulnerable segments of our community, the Government and the community must continue to work hand-in-hand to ensure that they are well supported through the different life milestones. For example, the Government has rolled out several initiatives, such as support measures for early childhood education, to better prepare our young for the future – this is the best way to ensure social mobility. For our community, these have been further amplified with community initiatives by the M3 agencies – namely, MUIS, MENDAKI and MESRA – as well as those undertaken by other Malay/Muslim organisations, to further amplify support for those in need. Minister Mohamad Maliki will share our plans on how M3 reinforces our network of care for our community and families, as we empower and engage this segment of our community to achieve their aspirations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00583,2022-03-10-T-011,583,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This year, Yayasan MENDAKI is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Some of us would have remembered then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's speech at the opening of the MENDAKI Congress at the Singapore Conference Hall in 1982, where he called for MENDAKI to raise the educational levels and thus the living standards of the community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00584,2022-03-10-T-011,584,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I am pleased that MENDAKI had applied his advice over the past 40 years. In working closely with its partners, MENDAKI had contributed to the very encouraging progress shown by the Malay/Muslim community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00585,2022-03-10-T-011,585,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past four decades, the proportion of Malay University graduates had increased multifold – from only four graduates in 1980 to almost 110 graduates in 2020, for every 1,000 Malays."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00586,2022-03-10-T-011,586,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Better education outcomes have also led to better career opportunities. The proportion of Malay PMETs has increased, from 7.2% in 1980 to 39% in 2020. This is more than five times! Congratulations!"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00587,2022-03-10-T-011,587,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But we cannot be satisfied now and end our journey here, especially when we are faced with stiffer global competition and even more rapid changes in technology. Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad will elaborate on MENDAKI's efforts to expand support beyond the classroom to offer more strategic programmes, in fulfilling the evolving needs of our community. These efforts stress the need to imbue a culture of lifelong learning in our community, especially through upskilling, so that we remain relevant in the new economy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00588,2022-03-10-T-011,588,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In English)  Chairman, as we speak of building relevant competencies for the new economy, we will also nurture future-ready asatizahs, our religious leaders, who are capable and confident in providing sound religious guidance in an ever-changing global landscape contextualised to Singapore's multi-religious, multiracial society. I will elaborate on MUIS' plans to shape a credible and resilient religious sector in the final speech of this segment."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00589,2022-03-10-T-011,589,,Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00590,2022-03-10-T-011,590,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Chairman, our community has done well. Over the last few decades, we have seen generations of Malay families do well and move up in life. At the same time, we still have some who still face challenges and need help as they progress."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00591,2022-03-10-T-011,591,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The Census 2020 found that home ownership in the Malay community remained high at 85.6%. Yet, the proportion of Malay households in public rental flats has doubled in the last decade. Member of Parliament Faisal Manap raised this issue during the Budget debate recently, saying that the community has regressed and families in rental flats are living in cramped conditions. It is sad to hear how Mr Faisal Manap had portrayed the plight of these families."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00592,2022-03-10-T-011,592,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"First, the increase in number of households in rental flats is in tandem with the higher supply of 1- and 3-room public rental flats in the past decade provided by HDB. Second, the public rental households include young families who need temporary accommodation while they stabilise their income and savings. Another group are flat owners who were not able to purchase another flat after selling their previous flats for various reasons, including divorce. Prior to moving into their rental flats, many would be living with extended family members in a crowded environment, far less conducive than what they have now. For these families, public rental flats provide improved living conditions, as the much-needed shelter for them, as they work through their various socio-economic challenges and aspire to be home owners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00593,2022-03-10-T-011,593,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"As a community, we are determined to uplift the vulnerable families, especially those with young children, to secure a brighter future. We set up Project DIAN@M3 last year to support families in our public rental flats to achieve greater social mobility. We will reinforce our network of care for the community through M3 in three ways."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00594,2022-03-10-T-011,594,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"First, upstream. We intend and we will invest early in our children's education, so that we can create a strong foundation for life for them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00595,2022-03-10-T-011,595,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Second, we will provide comprehensive support. We will empower families to achieve their aspirations to be home owners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00596,2022-03-10-T-011,596,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Third, we will galvanise resources. We will enhance community capabilities to strengthen support for families. Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00597,2022-03-10-T-011,597,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, allow me to share some of the challenges that families staying in public rental flats face. Recently, I met Ahmad, not his real name, and his wife. They live in a 2-room public rental flat. Both are 26 years old and have three young children between two and six years old. Ahmad works as a food delivery driver. His wife is unemployed. The young family is faced with financial difficulty and other challenges. Both grew up without stable home environments nor guidance from other family members. Ahmad's parents and his elder siblings are divorced. They also reside in public rental flats. As for Ahmad's wife, her mother passed away when she was two years old, while her father was mostly absent. They have to raise three children at such a young age, without guidance from their elders."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00598,2022-03-10-T-011,598,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The story of Ahmad's family reflects the situation faced by young families in rental flats. They are who we call, first-timer households – families who have neither purchased nor owned a flat but certainly have the potential to do so and do well in life. They feel overwhelmed by their circumstances as they lack the necessary skills and social support networks. We can strengthen the support network for these families and guide them to the resources and support available."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00599,2022-03-10-T-011,599,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"This group will be our focus. We will take an upstream approach to support them. First, we will help them stabilise and increase their incomes. Today, among first-timer households in rental flats with young children, more than 90% have either one or no breadwinner. About one-third are single-parent families while the rest are married couples. We will help them overcome whatever barriers they face, including supporting them to upgrade their skills through training and upskilling, as well as childcare issues."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00600,2022-03-10-T-011,600,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Through this upstream approach, we will focus on their children. There are about 2,300 first-time Malay households living in rental flats with at least one child aged six and below. In total, there are about 3,800 Malay children aged six and below living in public rental flats whose parents are first timers. About 60% of them have at least one child aged three and younger."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00601,2022-03-10-T-011,601,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The early years in a child's life are crucial in laying a strong foundation. This goes beyond preparing our young children academically, but also for them to develop well physically, mentally and socially. As the Malay saying goes, ""bend the bamboo while it is still a shoot"" – which means to mould a person while one is still young. In the past, most children attended school only at Primary 1 as preschool was not viewed seriously. In fact, it was called ""sekolah makan"" and many did not attend preschool. Today, around nine in 10 children in Singapore attend preschool by the age of four."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00602,2022-03-10-T-011,602,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"International research tells us that attending quality preschool early, from around age three, can boost children's confidence and social skills and help prepare them for school. So, we will endeavour to convince and urge these parents to send their children to preschool early, so that their children have at least three years of education before they enter Primary 1."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00603,2022-03-10-T-011,603,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"I share Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's view that more families can benefit from KidSTART. KidSTART is a programme that empowers parents and caregivers to provide infant care and childcare. Through home visits by KIDSTART facilitators, they will also be given appropriate learning tools as well as opportunities to practise effective parent-child interaction techniques. KIDSTART facilitators will also guide them on the appropriate nutritional needs of their children and ways to stimulate their children's brain development to harness their growth potential. These parents will also be assisted in enrolling their children in preschool. Regular screening of the child's development and maternal well-being are also conducted from the antenatal stage to when the child is three years old, so that timely interventions can be introduced should issues arise."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00604,2022-03-10-T-011,604,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Dr Wan Rizal asked about M3's efforts to ensure that young children in public rental flats receive early intervention. Through Project DIAN@M3, our M3 volunteers will work closely with KidSTART to strengthen support for Malay families living in public rental flats with young children. We will start with the three blocks under the Project DIAN@M3 pilot. Our volunteers will work closely with KidSTART officers, visit them regularly, support their child's development and befriend these families. As I mentioned earlier, there are about 3,800 children today aged six and below from Malay families living in public rental flats. I know that many are concerned about the future of these children, and I urge them to step forward to volunteer with us. Your acts of service and compassion have the ability to change the future of these children."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00605,2022-03-10-T-011,605,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"For children entering the formal school environment, we also want to improve their performance. We will provide tools and resources through M3 programmes, such as the KelasMateMatika@CC (KMM) and KelasSiapSekolah (KSS), so that they can succeed in school."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00606,2022-03-10-T-011,606,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about the success of KMM and KSS. KMM has successfully engaged close to 1,700 parents and more than 1,800 children last year. In 2021, 83% of KMM participants came from low-income families. KMM has shown promising results. More than 80% of students who attended KMM felt that they are more prepared for Primary 1 and did not require further assistance through the Learning Support for Mathematics in their respective schools. The KSS has also enrolled 98% of the target of 100 students last year. Parents have also benefited from KSS, with 90% of them reporting that they will use the approaches shared to guide their children."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00607,2022-03-10-T-011,607,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"MENDAKI is also going upstream to strengthen support to children in Mathematics in the early Primary school years, instead of at Primary 6 currently. For Primary 1 to Primary 3 children who have been identified as needing additional support, MENDAKI will bring coaches to their homes to provide one-on-one Mathematics lessons. This will mean a more intensive approach which will require more resources. We are prepared to allocate the necessary resources. The coaches will guide these children at their own pace of learning, recognising that each person has their own strengths. We are confident that the coaches' presence in the homes will inspire and empower the parents to be more involved in their children's education."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00608,2022-03-10-T-011,608,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"These upstream steps may be small but are crucial towards developing our children's competencies in their early years and building their confidence and resilience. In the long run, efforts in early childhood education will help achieve greater inter-generational mobility for these families."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00609,2022-03-10-T-011,609,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Chairman, Project DIAN@M3 also aims to help households in rental flats improve their incomes and work towards home ownership. This is their aspiration. And we want to help them make their dream a reality."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00610,2022-03-10-T-011,610,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"I am pleased to share with Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin and Ms Mariam Jaafar that since last December, Project DIAN@M3 has reached out to almost 65% of all Malay households in the three rental blocks during the first phase at M3@Bedok, M3@Geylang Serai and M3@Jalan Besar. We strengthen wrap-around support for families in rental flats by linking up these families with community and national programmes, including MSF's Community Link, MOE's UPLIFT and ECDA's KidSTART, to complement the Government's effort with an approach that aligns with the Malay community's culture and values. To facilitate this, we have formed the Project DIAN Steering Committee, comprising senior officers from the relevant Government and community agencies, to coordinate efforts among Government agencies and community partners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00611,2022-03-10-T-011,611,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"For more efficient service delivery, we have formed an Operations Group at the local level in each of the three pilot blocks. This local Operations Group comprises officers from the same Government agencies and community partners as the Project DIAN Steering Committee. Through this group, we will further understand each family's circumstances and needs, and work together to provide comprehensive support for them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00612,2022-03-10-T-011,612,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We acknowledge the important role of volunteers in the journey with these families and in guiding them every step of the way – from supporting their children's early education, to equipping parents with skillsets to secure good jobs and stable incomes to buy their own flat. Over the past few years, volunteers from MESRA and the Malay Activity Executive Committees (MAECs) have expanded their roles beyond just organising cultural events. Today, they work together with volunteers from the mosques and professional groups to engage and conduct needs assessment of Malay households in public rental units using similar forms as the MSF's ComLink programme. This will streamline efforts and thus allows us to provide customised services that meet the unique needs of each family."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00613,2022-03-10-T-011,613,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Ms Mariam Jaafar and Ms Nadia Admad Samdin also asked about the success indicators and long-term outcomes of Project DIAN@M3. Our aim is to strengthen the children's early childhood education to help them secure a brighter future, and for families to achieve stability, so that they can be self-reliant and eventually have social mobility. We will track each family's progress in meeting their goal to own their homes. We are confident that these efforts will pay off. But we all know that this process will take time."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00614,2022-03-10-T-011,614,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin asked for an update on the Family and Inmates Throughcare Assistance Haven, or FITRAH programme. Since 2019, FITRAH has supported about 2,600 families and 530 offenders. Seventy-five percent of these supported offenders are male. Uplifting the vulnerable requires a whole-of-community effort. Therefore, I am happy to see many Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) coming forward to support us in this effort, such as through FITRAH's MMO Alliance Network. I look forward to more MMOs partnering M3 to uplift our community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00615,2022-03-10-T-011,615,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, without the support of the community, the reach and impact of our programmes in uplifting the vulnerable will be limited. Our volunteers play an important role in reaching out to families to understand their concerns, conducting needs assessment and befriending them. Many of our volunteers have displayed empathy, patience and resilience. I thank all our M3 volunteers, who have dedicated timeless support for the families. They have been tirelessly helping these families work and walk the journey to achieve their aspirations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00616,2022-03-10-T-011,616,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"To expand our network of care, especially to the families with children aged six and below living in public rental flats, we need more volunteers to come forward to support us in this effort. We need volunteers who can inspire hope in families, engage them regularly over an extended period of time, thereby building rapport and trust with them. I encourage more from the community to step forward and contribute in whatever way they can. We will ensure that all M3 volunteers are equipped with the right knowledge and skillset to meaningfully engage families through the Volunteers Capability Building Framework. So far, more than 150 volunteers have attended our onboarding programme last year and about 120 volunteers have attended the basic house visit workshops."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00617,2022-03-10-T-011,617,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Despite restrictions during COVID-19, our M3@Towns have done well serving the community. A total of 77 initiatives were conducted by 11 M3@Towns last year, benefiting more than 53,000 residents. Our M3@Towns also supported residents through ground-up initiatives, such as the ""Jom Surf!"" – ""Jom"", Melayu word for ""Come"" – which equips our seniors with digital literacy. With guidance from our young volunteers, seniors built their confidence in using technology by learning how to use WhatsApp, Singpass and TraceTogether app. I attended one of these sessions recently and was heartened to see the enthusiasm of both our young volunteers and our senior learners. We bridge the digital gap and the generational gap at the same time."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00618,2022-03-10-T-011,618,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We will be organising another edition of the M3 Forum in the first half of next year after the last session in 2020, to bring together volunteers across various towns and programmes to network and share ideas and best practices."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00619,2022-03-10-T-011,619,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Chairman, we will continue our efforts to strengthen our programmes and outreach to targeted segments – our children, our families and the community – to build up their competencies and empower them to achieve their aspirations. This spirit of caring for one another binds us together and we will leave no one behind as we build our Community of Success. [Applause.]"

The Government, in partnership with industry and the community, is ramping up its efforts to better position our Malay community for employment in growth sectors while inculcating lifelong learning into our DNA. We will focus on upstream support by strengthening mentoring and early career guidance for youths in schools. This year, we have several new initiatives for our students in the ITEs. We will also enhance scholarship opportunities and financial support to help students pursue their aspirations. For those who have entered the workforce, we will partner industries to provide upskilling and direct emplacement opportunities for workers, especially in growth sectors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00623,2022-03-10-T-011,623,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Chairman, each child deserves an opportunity in life to actualise their potential. However, there may be times when they face challenges which weigh heavy on them, causing some to lose motivation and hope. Thus, having a support system is critical to motivate them to stay resilient and keep on the right path to fulfil their aspirations as well as their potential."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00624,2022-03-10-T-011,624,Zaqy Mohamad,"This is why MENDAKI is investing and strengthening its mentoring programmes. We believe that our youths can benefit from a mentor outside the classroom – a role model whom they can turn to for advice, look up to and learn from to realise their aspirations. At the same time, we want to provide opportunities for those who have succeeded to give back to the community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00625,2022-03-10-T-011,625,Zaqy Mohamad,"Ms Mariam Jaafar and Mr Sharael Taha asked for an update on MENDAKI's mentoring programmes. I am happy to report that, as of last year, the M3 Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) has matched over 1,000 mentors to more than 4,000 mentees across various mentoring programmes. The YMO will continue to expand the mentoring ecosystem and will be engaging a further 600 mentors and 2,000 mentees this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00626,2022-03-10-T-011,626,Zaqy Mohamad,"We are also glad to share that 10 community partners from the Community Leaders Forum (CLF), including the Majulah Community, Malay Youth Literary Association (4PM), AMP Singapore and Singapore Tenkasi, have come on board to conduct mentoring programmes for their own beneficiaries."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00627,2022-03-10-T-011,627,Zaqy Mohamad,"With the YMO, we are now making mentoring more accessible for all. I call on more from the community to step forward as mentors to help our youths thrive as successful adults."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00628,2022-03-10-T-011,628,Zaqy Mohamad,"To address Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin's query, mentoring programmes from MENDAKI and M3 Focus Area 3 partners are open to all Malay/Muslim students, including madrasah students. In fact, these programmes aim to expand the social circle and promote bonding among students from the various backgrounds. We have been taking this inclusive approach for other MENDAKI programmes, too, such as the Future Ready initiatives and career programmes, which are designed to prepare our youths for meaningful careers, no matter their background."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00629,2022-03-10-T-011,629,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Abdul Samad asked about the students in our Institutes of Higher Learning. In 2021, there were 5,000 Malay graduates from ITE, 3,200 from the Polytechnics and 800 from the Autonomous Universities (AUs). On average, about 30 Malay graduates from each ITE cohort progressed to the Autonomous Universities. You can imagine the pathways and I think it is quite commendable."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00630,2022-03-10-T-011,630,Zaqy Mohamad,"According to the latest Graduate Employment Survey, among economically-active Malay graduates, about nine in 10 graduates from the Autonomous Universities and Polytechnics, and eight in 10 graduates from ITE were employed within six months of graduation. Their employment outcomes are broadly comparable to their peers from other ethnic groups."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00631,2022-03-10-T-011,631,Zaqy Mohamad,"Chairman, this year, we will provide more support for our youths in ITE to complement the Government's efforts to enhance applied education in Singapore. Piloted in 2019, MENDAKI’s Empowerment Programme at ITE seeks to build support systems and help students acquire life skills, develop confidence and grow their potential."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00632,2022-03-10-T-011,632,Zaqy Mohamad,"To Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman's question, the Empowerment Programme has benefited more than 2,000 mentees since its inception. Through the programme, MENDAKI has managed to enrol one in every five Malay/Muslim NITEC students in 2021. The programme has proven to be successful. Ninety-six percent of participants from the Empowerment Programme in 2021 remained in school and progressed to their second year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00633,2022-03-10-T-011,633,Zaqy Mohamad,"One student who benefited from the ITE Empowerment Programme is Muhammad Roth Isaac from ITE College West. Isaac took on a part-time job to help his family of four after his father's income was affected by the pandemic. Even though Isaac is just a teenager, he had to deal with the pressure and responsibility of juggling school and supporting his family. Fortunately, he had a caring mentor, Mr Sandeep Krishna, who constantly checked on his well-being and helped him with his studies. Mr Sandeep currently works as a Network Engineer. Despite his heavy work commitment, he sets aside time for mentoring. Mr Sandeep recalls the challenges he faced as a student not too long ago and, hence, he believes in the value of guiding youths towards their potential. Mr Sandeep befriended Isaac and motivated him to remain in school. Isaac remained focused and managed to achieve a 3.7 GPA in his first year of NITEC. So, well done, Isaac, and thank you, Mr Sandeep! We need more like them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00634,2022-03-10-T-011,634,Zaqy Mohamad,"We need to help more students like Isaac to do well – not only for themselves, but for their families and the community. The ITE Empowerment Programme will be refreshed to the #amPowered@ITE programme, which will retain key elements of its predecessor, but enhanced to include a tiered mentoring approach where mentees will be assigned to programmes based on their unique needs. This means tailoring the mentoring approach for each mentee to achieve specific objectives, depending on their circumstances. The #amPowered programme will also be progressively made available under the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme (MTS) and at our M3 Towns."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00635,2022-03-10-T-011,635,Zaqy Mohamad,"We agree with Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman and Mr Sharael Taha that our students can benefit from structured career guidance, especially to growth sectors, such as information and communications, financial and insurance services, and professional services. Growth sectors. Thus, to complement the mentoring programmes, MENDAKI will deploy Care Advisors at each of the YouthSpaces in the three ITE Colleges. Their role is to guide students on possible education pathways and connect them to skilling or emplacement opportunities. Care Advisors can also be found at MENDAKI's satellite centres to serve the Malay/Muslim community at large."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00636,2022-03-10-T-011,636,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Chairman, over the years, MENDAKI has provided bursaries, study loans and subsidies, so that financial circumstances do not impede our students from achieving success. Moving forward, MENDAKI will focus on providing targeted financial support for the developmental needs of our students and broaden the opportunities for them to build career aspirations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00637,2022-03-10-T-011,637,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Faisal Manap may be pleased to note that MENDAKI has been actively growing its industry partnerships to provide scholarships for our students to position them into growth sectors. This year, I am pleased to announce the launch of the GIC-MENDAKI Scholarship."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00638,2022-03-10-T-011,638,Zaqy Mohamad,"Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, in collaboration with MENDAKI, will introduce a new undergraduate scholarship for Singaporean Malay students who are keen to pursue a career in the finance industry. The scholarship is in partnership with three local Universities – NUS, NTU and SMU – and will cover the undergraduate tuition fees for most degree programmes in these Universities. GIC will provide structured internships, job rotations, networking and mentorship for the scholarship recipients. So, they can expect an exciting and purposeful career with GIC upon their graduation."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00639,2022-03-10-T-011,639,Zaqy Mohamad,"The GIC-MENDAKI Scholarship is the latest effort by MENDAKI to collaborate with the industry to provide a springboard for our youths into careers in fast-growing industries. This follows other scholarships, such as the MENDAKI-MiRXES scholarship formed last year in Life and Biomedical Sciences, and the SIA-MENDAKI scholarship. These scholarships provide students with priority internship opportunities and secure employment upon their graduation. MENDAKI will continue to expand these opportunities and I urge all Malay/Muslim students to work hard and seize them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00640,2022-03-10-T-011,640,Zaqy Mohamad,"The generosity of our corporate partners and community has enabled us to provide more support to deserving students. Since we set up the Education Trust Fund (ETF) in 2003, MENDAKI has disbursed over $30 million in financial assistance donated by the community to over 130,000 Muslim students."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00641,2022-03-10-T-011,641,Zaqy Mohamad,"Last year, over $1 million of ETF bursaries was established, including the ETF-Gafoor PropNex Bursary and Math Coaching Fund. On top of school necessities, this bursary would directly pay for students' development programmes in Mathematics. I hope this targeted approach will be the way forward for MENDAKI to better support the immediate needs of our students and their growth."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00642,2022-03-10-T-011,642,Zaqy Mohamad,"I have explained how we intend to prepare our youths for the future. So, let me now elaborate on our plans to provide more directed and targeted support to emplace our Malay/Muslim workers into growth industries. Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00643,2022-03-10-T-011,643,Zaqy Mohamad,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, I have explained how we intend to strengthen upstream mentoring and career guidance efforts to help our youths achieve their dreams."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00644,2022-03-10-T-011,644,Zaqy Mohamad,"MENDAKI will also enhance financial support and scholarship opportunities to help students pursue their aspirations to succeed. For those in the workforce, we will build up their competencies, so that they stay relevant for new and growing industries."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00645,2022-03-10-T-011,645,Zaqy Mohamad,"Last year, MENDAKI conducted 15 career fairs, participated by over 700 job seekers. Out of these, more than 300 workers were placed in jobs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00646,2022-03-10-T-011,646,Zaqy Mohamad,"As part of MENDAKI's transformation efforts, we will expand our partnerships with national training agencies to emplace our Malay/Muslim workers in growth industries, such as in technology and the green economy. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Sharael Taha also asked how these efforts will benefit our new job seekers and mid-career workers. Mr Saktiandi Supaat also gave a few suggestions which we will study further. Do allow me to explain the Government's approach in more detail."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00647,2022-03-10-T-011,647,Zaqy Mohamad,"MENDAKI will build on our partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to promote capability development programmes to the community. We will augment national efforts by mobilising MENDAKI's Care Advisors at our five satellite centres. These Care Advisors will also be deployed at SSG career fairs held at the various M3@Towns. The aim is to increase awareness within the community about the activities and services offered by SSG, as well as share information on Future Ready programmes. The community can look out for our Care Advisors at the employment fairs, to get the necessary advice."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00648,2022-03-10-T-011,648,Zaqy Mohamad,"MENDAKI will also join forces with NTUC to help our Malay workers secure job placements in emerging and growth sectors. Besides offering various job development programmes, NTUC will link our workers to job opportunities and training at the workplace to enable them to reskill and upskill themselves into hiring industries."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00649,2022-03-10-T-011,649,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Government will continue our efforts to support Malay/Muslim workers to build up their competencies and enhance their employability. This includes strengthening the leadership core of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMO) through the Tunas Bersama M3 programme launched last year, and this will further enhance our collective efforts to ensure our community's continued progress. More details on the Tunas Bersama M3 programme will be shared in the near future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00650,2022-03-10-T-011,650,Zaqy Mohamad,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, the community has shown good progress in employment in the last 10 years and we aim to do even better in the years to come."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00651,2022-03-10-T-011,651,Zaqy Mohamad,"As MENDAKI celebrates its 40th anniversary, it remains invested in the community's success by looking at more strategic programmes to support our youths to pursue their aspirations and for our workers to strengthen their competencies in a dynamic workforce. Our growth has only been possible with the strong support of our community and our partners. So, let us all work together as one, keeping the community at the heart of what we are doing so that they, too, can do well for themselves and contribute back to society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00652,2022-03-10-T-011,652,Zaqy Mohamad,This continuous cycle of support would go a long way in strengthening the competencies of our Community of Success. [Applause.]
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00653,2022-03-10-T-011,653,,Minister Masagos Zulkifli.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00654,2022-03-10-T-011,654,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00655,2022-03-10-T-011,655,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Our asatizahs are well-regarded within the community for their important role. In fact, there had been prominent religious scholars in Singapore, such as Ustaz Syed Ahmad Semait, Ustaz Syed Abdillah al-Jufri and Ustaz Ahmad Sonhadji. They have made significant contributions to the Islamic religious discourse in Singapore. The religious texts they produced are still being read and used as reference today. Many of my peers grew up with Ustaz Ahmad Sonhadji's foundation text – Mari Sembahyang, or ""Let's Pray""."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00656,2022-03-10-T-011,656,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are fortunate to have our own local madrasahs that ensure a steady pipeline of asatizah talents. They are also familiar with our way of life within Singapore's context. Since the curriculum review implemented over 20 years ago, madrasah students now are capable of pursuing either Islamic Studies at the higher education level or take up secular education."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00657,2022-03-10-T-011,657,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Abdul Samad asked about the retention rate of students in the madrasah system. Every year, the madrasahs collectively enrol about 380 students at Primary 1. Within each cohort, about 50 students leave to join the national schools, either within the six years of Primary school education, or after the PSLE. Among those who remain, about half will pursue post-Secondary education in secular institutions. Today, about one in every four students who started their education in the madrasah graduate from the religious track and become asatizahs. One in every four students. Based on the Asatizah Manpower Planning Study, this is almost sufficient. Indeed, we should be proud that our madrasah students have no problems switching to secular education. However, it should be emphasised that the main goal of madrasah education here is to produce new asatizahs who can guide the Singapore Muslim community and expand our asatizah sector, in addition to contributing to broader sectors should they wish to do so."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00658,2022-03-10-T-011,658,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For students who eventually become asatizahs, they need to be able to provide sound religious advice. They need to understand the lived realities of the community here and be sensitive to the cultural nuances to guide the Muslim community in navigating new and complex challenges. In line with this year's focus on enhancing competencies within our community, we will support the asatizah sector to acquire impactful competencies. This will be done through three strategies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00659,2022-03-10-T-011,659,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, we want to develop critical bodies of knowledge for the asatizahs, so that they can be exposed to broader perspectives and worldviews."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00660,2022-03-10-T-011,660,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, we will enhance the career pathways for the religious sector, to ensure that this profession remains appealing and relevant."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00661,2022-03-10-T-011,661,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Third, we want to mobilise community resources to sustain the development of our religious sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00662,2022-03-10-T-011,662,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the need for our asatizahs to be prepared to address complex issues in a contemporary society and unprecedented global challenges. In addition to acquiring a deep knowledge of our religious traditions and having a strong character, our asatizahs must also possess the competency to contextualise religious teachings to Singapore. This requires them to form a strong connection with our multiracial society, in order to better understand our experience of living in a country full of diversity. This is especially so, because our experience as a Muslim-minority community is different from those of Muslim-majority societies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00663,2022-03-10-T-011,663,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, I agree with Dr Wan Rizal that we need to develop bodies of knowledge that can guide Muslim-minority communities living in multi-religious societies to navigate contemporary socio-religious issues more confidently, while enabling them to practise their faith with ease. On this front, we have rolled out several initiatives like the ISEAS-MUIS Masters Scholarship, the Research Programme in the Study of Muslim Communities of Success, as well as the Postgraduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies (PCICS)."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00664,2022-03-10-T-011,664,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Abdul Samad asked about efforts to help returning Islamic Studies graduates contextualise their knowledge for the local community. This is the aim of the PCICS, which provides returning students with the framework to apply their knowledge to the local context. One of the graduates who benefited from the PCICS programme is Ustazah Sarah El Rani. She found the programme useful in deepening her understanding of Islamic traditions, such as the use of Maqasid Shariah in Islamic Jurisprudence to address new challenges faced by societies. This allowed her to better understand its application in the Singapore context, such as the adjustments made to religious practices as part of COVID-19 preventive measures."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00665,2022-03-10-T-011,665,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To address Dr Shahira Abdullah's query on support given to returning Islamic Studies graduates, our key focus is to ensure that these graduates contribute back to the Muslim religious sector in Singapore. The PCICS equips them with the knowledge to provide progressive religious guidance, while exposing them to critical skills and competencies that can also be applied in relevant non-religious sectors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00666,2022-03-10-T-011,666,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MUIS will be organising the International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS) later this year. Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Dr Wan Rizal asked about the key objectives of this conference and how it will benefit the Singapore Muslim community. Building on the two pre-conference seminars held last year, the upcoming conference will bring together religious scholars to develop critical bodies of knowledge that can guide Muslim-minority communities in multicultural societies. With the theme ""Contributing Citizens, Dynamic Institutions"", it will focus on how enlightened and contextualised religious guidance, coupled with institutional support, can empower Muslims to live as dignified citizens and contribute to the nation's development. Delegates from various nations will be invited to share and learn from one another."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00667,2022-03-10-T-011,667,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For students who have done well in the madrasahs, I hope more of you will go into the religious sector and see the asatizah profession not merely as an employment opportunity, but as a meaningful and attractive calling. This is my hope for students who have done well in the ""A"" Levels, the IB Diploma, as well as the Aliyah programmes. They are excellent candidates for the next generation of our future asatizahs. We will continue to support these students in their education, including providing prestigious scholarships for the talented ones to further their studies. This is how we can ensure strong leadership renewal in our religious institutions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00668,2022-03-10-T-011,668,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For those that show potential, MUIS offers the Religious Leadership and Talent Development Programme, or RLTD. Presently, around 120 asatizahs have benefited from the various initiatives within this programme. It provides participants opportunities to have fireside chats with community and religious figures and benefit from mentoring programmes. Most participants have found the programmes useful as part of their career development in the religious sector. This addresses the questions from Dr Wan Rizal and Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman about plans to develop and groom asatizah leadership in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00669,2022-03-10-T-011,669,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Under the RLTD as well, MUIS is introducing the Leadership Milestone Programme which provides formal training for asatizahs with good potential. The objective is to further develop and groom them for future leadership roles. This comprises two key tracks."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00670,2022-03-10-T-011,670,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First is the general leadership track, where asatizahs will benefit from a wide range of courses offered by various public and private institutions, to hone their competencies before they lead an organisation. This includes courses in financial management, strategy formulation and human capital management."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00671,2022-03-10-T-011,671,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second is the religious leadership track. This seeks to deepen the asatizah's knowledge and appreciation of our religious traditions and its application in the Singapore context. Under this track, the Leadership Executive Programme will provide a platform for asatizahs to have discussions on the religious life of the Singapore Muslim community and gain a deeper understanding of policy issues."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00672,2022-03-10-T-011,672,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"These initiatives will expose our asatizahs to a wide range of issues, to help nurture their leadership potential and hone their critical thinking, especially on religious issues impacting our Muslim community. Ultimately, our aim is to prepare the younger generation of asatizahs to be ready to serve when called to higher office, including helming our key religious institutions, such as the Mufti, the President of the Syariah Court and the Kadi at ROMM."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00673,2022-03-10-T-011,673,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, we need to structure clear and meaningful career pathways for the asatizah. This includes remuneration for the asatizahs, as asked by Mr Abdul Samad and Dr Shahira Abdullah. MUIS is reviewing the salary guidelines for the religious sector, especially for those working in the formal religious sector like mosques and madrasahs. We will need to ensure the sector is equally attractive as competing sectors. Details will be provided when the review is completed."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00674,2022-03-10-T-011,674,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will also need to fund the long-term needs of our religious sector. This is why there are plans to encourage the wakaf culture within our community, as asked by Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Dr Shahira Abdullah. Since the launch of Singapore Community Wakaf, an Advisory Panel has been formed to get feedback from key stakeholders and put forth recommendations on how to galvanise community support in the implementation of this wakaf."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00675,2022-03-10-T-011,675,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This year, MUIS formed working groups, comprising MUIS officers and industry experts, to implement detailed action plans for the Singapore Community Wakaf. It will take into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Panel Report that was submitted last year. This includes plans like engaging our institutions like the wakaf and mosques to pool our assets together and invest their reserves to grow the corpus fund; and second, encouraging the community's participation through public education initiatives on wakaf, particularly on wealth and legacy planning."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00676,2022-03-10-T-011,676,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Chairman, in English, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00677,2022-03-10-T-011,677,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In English)  Chairman, to further support the development of our young asatizahs, MUIS is dedicating a campus for the PCICS programme, to be housed within the Wakaf Bencoolen complex. The new campus will include various learning facilities, including its own library, and is expected to be completed by the end of this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00678,2022-03-10-T-011,678,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Initiatives, such as the RLTD, PCICS and the International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS), are key enablers to propel the asatizah sector forward and we will need the community's support to achieve its desired outcomes. The Singapore Community Wakaf will thus be crucial in catering for the long-term needs of the Muslim community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00679,2022-03-10-T-011,679,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Chairman, in conclusion, my colleagues and I have spoken on three strategies to strengthen our competencies as a Community of Success. Underpinning these strategies are strong and resilient families who provide a conducive environment for children to grow and achieve their fullest potential."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00680,2022-03-10-T-011,680,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Here, our community partners and institutions play an important role. Our Naib Kadis, for example, are key partners in supporting the work of building strong and resilient Muslim families, especially through the Bersamamu programme. In this regard, the M³ agencies will also partner MSF to commemorate the ""Year of Celebrating SG Families"" this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00681,2022-03-10-T-011,681,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Through these efforts, we will keep social mobility alive in Singapore, so that every Singaporean has a fair chance to succeed in life and contribute back to the society. In this regard, we will journey with our community every step of the way to propel them towards success. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00682,2022-03-10-T-011,682,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00683,2022-03-10-T-011,683,Saktiandi Supaat,"Chairman, I would like to thank Minister Masagos Zulkifli, Second Minister Mohamad Maliki and Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad for answering my questions. I have two clarifications. First is in regard to the GIC-MENDAKI scholarship for Singaporean students, I really welcome the announcement. It is a good step in that direction. I need to seek further details on the scholarship."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00684,2022-03-10-T-011,684,Saktiandi Supaat,"One, when will it be offered? How many recipients will be awarded the scholarship? What are the eligibility criteria? And would there be further expansion to possibly postgraduate scholarships because I mentioned that the SkillsFuture credit take-up is quite low. So, the lifelong learning efforts in the community can be enhanced even further through postgraduate scholarships as well."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00685,2022-03-10-T-011,685,Saktiandi Supaat,My second clarification is with regard to the question in my cut. What are our plans for a sectoral-based approach to enhance our PMET representations in sectors which are growing as well as sectors that are growth industries as it is now? What are our plans for corporate scholarships and partnerships because of the points that I raised earlier about low PMET numbers and the low take-up of SkillsFuture credits?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00686,2022-03-10-T-011,686,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I thank the Member for his clarification and for acknowledging the hard work that MENDAKI has put in, to put some of our industry scholarships together. So, I am pleased that the GIC-MENDAKI scholarship has come about and we will announce more details in due course. Do keep watch for this because I am quite sure it will excite quite a number of prospective young graduates who are keen to join the financial sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00687,2022-03-10-T-011,687,Zaqy Mohamad,"On postgraduate scholarships, generally, as a basis, if you look at where the Government is putting its resources today, we have made a lot of push with SkillsFuture to support individuals, regardless of where they are, to gain mastery of skills and master lifelong learning. It is not just about going for a Master's or postgraduate degree, but there are also other skills training and certificates you can go for postgraduate studies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00688,2022-03-10-T-011,688,Zaqy Mohamad,"But even today, there are schemes like the SkillsFuture Mid-career Enhanced subsidy and the SkillsFuture Work-Study degree. You can also go for the Work-Study degree that is open to all eligible Singaporeans, including the Malay/Muslim community. These are already available scholarships that are provided across nationally. Where MENDAKI comes in is, really, to augment the suite of existing financial assistance."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00689,2022-03-10-T-011,689,Zaqy Mohamad,"But our intent, as Mr Saktiandi may note, is that we have already started with SIA, followed by MiRXES and now GIC. There is a certain trend that we are going to work towards to look for more like-minded corporate partners who could support the move of our Malay community. One, to enhance and to provide them with a pathway into growth sectors, but also more importantly for them, it also helps to build diversity and a strong Singaporean Core for PMETs in the various companies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00690,2022-03-10-T-011,690,Zaqy Mohamad,"We hope to announce more in future, but it is going to be hard work in the next coming months and years to make sure that we can expand this programme further."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00691,2022-03-10-T-011,691,,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00692,2022-03-10-T-011,692,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Thank you, Chairman. I thank the Minister for the announcement on the update on the Singapore Community Wakaf. I think the bigger issue will be the general estate planning, future planning and retirement security of our community. So, I agree that public awareness is key."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00693,2022-03-10-T-011,693,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"If I may ask, with the workgroup, will there be other efforts to be made to approach the community and engage the community through the community partners, preferably through M3 and other Malay/Muslim organisations to tailor-make the message, for example, just like ""Dadah Itu Haram"" campaign that is quite effective for the community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00694,2022-03-10-T-011,694,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Secondly, what would be the framework of support that we would encourage the take-up of such strategies to plan for estate planning and wealth planning, including the recruitment of Wakaf and also the Lasting Power of Attorney. This could also include legislative amendments and the proposals that I suggested in terms of the Syariah court and MUIS' recommendations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00695,2022-03-10-T-011,695,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would like to thank the Member for the clarification. For Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura (WMS), like the Member has pointed out, the last one was given almost 40 years ago. In fact, more than 40 years ago. This culture of bequeathing your property to benefit yourself for your religious needs – but more importantly, to benefit society for the long term – is a culture that we have had for 1,400 years and we have had it in Singapore when Muslim Singaporeans had become wealthy during the early days of our colonisation. And in bequeathing these properties and, actually, in enhancing these properties alone, we have managed to accumulate something like almost $800 billion worth of assets. That is wonderful."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00696,2022-03-10-T-011,696,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Unfortunately, I would say there are some constraints on how the benefits of such bequeathed properties and trusts should be distributed. Sometimes, we have problems finding the village in a country that does not exist anymore or people whom we do not know whether they are still around to benefit from these assets and trusts. And, therefore, going forward, we have to look at how these problems do not get encountered again by us and future generations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00697,2022-03-10-T-011,697,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I also want to point out that in formulating WMS, it is beyond just calling the community to bequeath their assets; it is also calling them to prepare their children to be well-endowed through education, career and also to build their own wealth, so that they do not rely on their parents' wealth to live on in their life. And that their parents also do not feel guilty in giving away that wealth for the sake of the community, for the future of the community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00698,2022-03-10-T-011,698,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are in a good place and time right now, because, as Members have heard from many of our speeches just now, the community is at that inflexion point of being better and acquiring wealth for themselves. And I am calling them  it is great that you are benefiting yourself and your children; just think about benefiting the community and for the future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00699,2022-03-10-T-011,699,,Dr Shahira Abdullah.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00700,2022-03-10-T-011,700,Shahira Abdullah,"Thank you, Chairman. I have a few clarifications. I note that we are going to have a salary review of the asatizahs and I also realised that it was announced somewhere in early 2020. May I know what is the rough timeline and when we can expect the results of the review since it was announced in 2020?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00701,2022-03-10-T-011,701,Shahira Abdullah,"Secondly, I would like to say that the PCICS is a wonderful initiative. From what I see from the news recently, they were given a salary incentive of $100, but it was only offered to those working in mosques and madrasahs. May I know whether it will be extended or expanded to other asatizahs and whether this $100 is benchmarked against other sectors?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00702,2022-03-10-T-011,702,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For MUIS, we can only be in control of the sectors under our care and that have to do with our madrasahs and mosques. I am very thankful that the mosque community, the madrasah community have responded without us making it compulsory or mandated through MUIS' instructions. I call upon the other sectors to do the same – recognise our asatizahs, give them a meaningful salary scale, salary level, let them live a dignified life like everybody else, like the ones that we want for our own children."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00703,2022-03-10-T-011,703,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I believe our community is very, very generous. We have not pulled ourselves back whenever we call for support for our friends in Palestine when some calamity has befallen them. In fact, in many circumstances, through the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF), when disasters happened around our area, we have been able to collect donations to help victims who are not Muslims, who do not live in Muslim countries. So, we have also given, regardless of race, language or religion."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00704,2022-03-10-T-011,704,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, for our asatizahs, we should be more generous and not hold back this amount. There is no benchmark for this, but, over the long term, we hope that the review on the salaries will tell us exactly where we are, what the gaps are, and, more importantly, how to get the funds to fund this gap, and here is where we will need to rely on the wealth and generosity of our own community to fund our own religious needs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00705,2022-03-10-T-011,705,,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00706,2022-03-10-T-011,706,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I would like to thank Minister Masagos Zulkifli and Second Minister Mohamad Maliki Osman. In Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00707,2022-03-10-T-011,707,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I would like to come back to my two questions on FITRAH, that is, if M3 will collaborate with the Malay/Muslim organisations, ComLink and other agencies. Are there plans to offer and coordinate support to the family of offenders, not just at the beginning or the end of their incarceration period, but throughout the sentence so that the offender's family can emerge stronger?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00708,2022-03-10-T-011,708,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Second, as the FITRAH programme requires the commitment and support from a rather large number of volunteers, how will the FITRAH structure be strengthened for the long term?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00709,2022-03-10-T-011,709,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Sir, I thank Ms Nadia Samdin for the supplementary question. She is absolutely right. When we work with families, like those under FITRAH, it is very complex. The structure of the families is very complex. Sometimes, you do have the father in prison, single mothers having to deal with very young children. Sometimes, you have both parents who are in prison, incarcerated and the children are under the care of grandparents, making it very complex."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00710,2022-03-10-T-011,710,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"When we started FITRAH, it was really looking at many different dimensions. One is to ensure that the needs of the children are supported primarily by family members who are outside, because it is the stability of the children, while the parents are incarcerated, that is very critical. And stability comes in the form of ensuring that they continue to be able to go to school, they are able to get support for their socio-emotional development and everything around that concept. And that is the first part of looking after the children – to understand their socio-emotional needs, and even their economic needs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00711,2022-03-10-T-011,711,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"At the same time, we ensure that work with the inmates continue. That is very important. And the reason why we put the framework in place is to give a very strong message to the inmates that it is a time for reflection and rehabilitation for you, too, so that when you do come out and get released, that you do make every attempt to turn over a new leaf."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00712,2022-03-10-T-011,712,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"And this is very important because, sometimes, we do come across inmates who repeat the offences and they go back in and we want to make sure that FITRAH provides comprehensive support to prevent relapses amongst the inmates."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00713,2022-03-10-T-011,713,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"On collaboration and coordination of different programmes, I assure Ms Nadia Samdin that we continue to do so. Part of the effort of helping FITRAH families will be the effort of UPLIFT, part of the effort will be under ComLink. So, the coordination effort is being worked on and, certainly, we agree that it is not just while the inmate is incarcerated, support must continue to be given even after they have been released so that they see stabilisation has been achieved while they are incarcerated. Yet, at the same time, we work towards independence and self-reliance moving forward for the incarcerated individual and their families."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00714,2022-03-10-T-011,714,Tin Pei Ling,"Chairman, community harmony is important to engender a sense of collective and shared destiny. But this can be undermined at times by misunderstandings and disputes. During our constituency work, we would have come across a range of community disputes – noise from neighbours, noise from groups playing at the basketball court downstairs, cigarette smell, incessant high-rise littering, irresponsible feeding, encroachment of common space and the list goes on. In these disputes, one party may be puzzled about why does the other party not understand or comply with the implicit and explicit ""rules""; the other party may think that there was nothing wrong with the behaviour and wonder why the complainant is making life difficult."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00715,2022-03-10-T-011,715,Tin Pei Ling,"Small disagreements, if left unresolved, can fester into ill-feelings and anti-social behaviours with long-lasting effects. Our community is diverse, with people of different backgrounds. The idea of co-existence is important, though a delicate balance to strike. Community norms, therefore, play a critical role in keeping a certain order and harmony in the community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00716,2022-03-10-T-011,716,Tin Pei Ling,"As time passes or as environment changes, norms could shift. The pandemic has forced us to stay home more. We face one another more and things that used to not bother us can become difficult to bear. So, we need to review, re-establish and/or revise the norms needed in the community. To do so, we need more dialogues and engagements but, most importantly, is that the community must come to a common understanding on the priorities and acceptable behaviours within the community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00717,2022-03-10-T-011,717,Tin Pei Ling,"To this end, the Community Dispute Resolution Framework has been a useful and complementary tool to improve community dispute management. Therefore, I would like to ask how MCCY will continue to enhance the framework to effectively manage community disputes and relations, while partnering Singaporeans to co-create and establish community norms in their own neighbourhoods."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00718,2022-03-10-T-011,718,Derrick Goh,"Mr Chairman, one major lifestyle change arising from COVID-19 has been about more residents working or learning from home."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00719,2022-03-10-T-011,719,Derrick Goh,"Along with this trend, we are seeing a rise in the number of disputes within the community. For example, last year, HDB reported around 38,400 cases of noise-related feedback, a 25% increase from 2020, while the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) also saw higher applications."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00720,2022-03-10-T-011,720,Derrick Goh,"When community disputes arise, grassroots volunteers and on-the-ground agencies, such as HDB, Town Council or Police, are often the first responders to help engage the parties. Those of us who have helped to mediate a dispute will know that they are never easy. With the number of conflicts between neighbours on the rise, our first responders will be strained with more cases."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00721,2022-03-10-T-011,721,Derrick Goh,"Given this, can the Minister share if MCCY will dedicate more resources, such as improving training for our first responders, to help our communities be more effective in managing such conflicts?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00722,2022-03-10-T-011,722,Derrick Goh,"The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) also plays an integral role in resolving neighbour disputes. Mediation at the CMC is an informal and voluntary process, conducted by professionally-trained mediators who are volunteers from all walks of life. Cases referred to the CMC have seen relative success. Can the Minister share more on CMC's effectiveness and will the Government consider mandating mediation for community disputes?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00723,2022-03-10-T-011,723,Derrick Goh,"Lastly, a legal avenue for resolving disputes is the CDRT. My constituents gave feedback that those who have engaged with the CDRT have not found it to be easy, as they faced long battles which are often adversarial in nature, usually as a result of counter parties raising evidence or allegations haphazardly during proceedings. The process may, therefore, result in more friction and deteriorate relationships further. Therefore, it is important to ensure that parties engaging in the legal process will be able to ensure quick and effective justice at a lower cost."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00724,2022-03-10-T-011,724,Derrick Goh,"Experts and businesses have said that this hybrid model of working and learning from home is here to stay, even if the pandemic ends. I look forward to the Minister's plans on how the Government can strengthen existing solutions to counter the growth in community disputes, so as to preserve our social cohesion and harmony."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00725,2022-03-10-T-011,725,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I would like to seek the Minister's update on the review of the community dispute management framework, which commenced before last year's Committee of Supply. Can the Minister share who the members of the interagency committee conducting this review are and when the review will be completed? How many mediators does the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) currently have and is this sufficient to manage their workload?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00726,2022-03-10-T-011,726,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I have met residents who have a vexing dispute with their neighbours but are unwilling to let me refer them for mediation because they know their neighbour will not turn up for the session. Of the average of 735 cases per year registered at the CMC, 70% did not progress to mediation, mainly because one or both parties declined or did not respond to the invitation to mediate. To improve the take-up rate of mediation, could the Ministry consider these suggestions?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00727,2022-03-10-T-011,727,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"First, once the CMC assesses a case to be suitable for mediation, can attendance of both parties be made compulsory? Second, if the dispute eventually goes to the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT), can the Tribunal be allowed to draw an adverse inference from their non-attendance? This potential penalty should be made clear to respondents when the invitation to the CMC is served."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00728,2022-03-10-T-011,728,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Next, I have received feedback from residents about the difficulty they face in filing CDRT evidence. For example, they need to save their audio or video recordings on a CD-ROM or DVD. Most people nowadays do not have a CD-ROM burner in their home. Can the CDRT update its processes to allow evidence to be uploaded on the web portal instead and to make the whole process more user-friendly for the layman?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00729,2022-03-10-T-011,729,Gan Thiam Poh,"Madam, disputes among neighbours are becoming increasingly common. Unfortunately, a significant number take a long time to resolve due to the uncooperative neighbours, some of whom are openly and persistently flouting the law. These cases include harassment, obstruction of passageways, dangerous placement of objects, fire hazard and noise pollution. Would the Ministry consider setting up a dedicated team for mediation and enforcement and a hotline for residents to contact for issues relating to neighbour disputes?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00730,2022-03-10-T-011,730,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Madam, I wish to ask MCCY how many Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) cases have been filed, heard, mediated and adjudicated on annually in the past five years."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00731,2022-03-10-T-011,731,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Also, what actions, if any, have our Courts or complainants taken when offending parties, even after the tribunal order, still continue to perpetrate and breach the order?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00732,2022-03-10-T-011,732,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I wish to also ask MCCY to share if there are plans to better ensure the more effective and efficient resolution of CDRT complaints as there are more situations of work from home and resulting in more neighbourly disputes and some of these disputes cannot be resolved via the voluntary mediation route via community mediation and whether such mediation, moving forward, can be made compulsory?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00733,2022-03-10-T-011,733,,Ms Joan Pereira. Please take your two cuts together.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00734,2022-03-10-T-011,734,Joan Pereira,"Madam, the COVID-19 pandemic ignited a spirit of ""gotong-royong"" in my division when the Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre became a COVID-19 cluster last year. Many residents, community partners, religious organisations, private companies and strangers reached out to me and my community to volunteer and offer various forms of help, especially to the hawkers and the vulnerable in my division. It was very heartwarming and the community became even more closely-knit and resilient. With the pandemic placing restrictions on community events, which we used to organise in the past, we need to reorganise how we connect and strengthen ties among our neighbours. Building friendship and trust amongst our neighbours must still continue to be the focus."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00735,2022-03-10-T-011,735,Joan Pereira,"However, we know that disputes still occur. What we observe sometimes is that relationships become so bad that neighbours do not talk to each other and, in some cases, even dragging in other neighbours into the dispute, creating a non-harmonious living environment. I hope that MCCY can empower our grassroots volunteers and staff with relevant skillsets to mediate disputes between neighbours. It is best when things can be settled and nipped in the bud at the local level without further straining relationships. How will MCCY empower our grassroots leaders and staff to build on this spirit of care and continue to strengthen community life at the local neighbourhood level?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00736,2022-03-10-T-011,736,Joan Pereira,"The mission of our Inter-racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) is ever more important today as we face sharper fault lines and greater challenges to our racial and religious harmony. When there is conflict, especially when it involves potentially sensitive racial or religious issues, we must quickly seek to resolve and nip the problem in the bud. We should not ignore it and hope for it to blow over, thereby allowing the problem to fester and blow up into a bigger problem."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00737,2022-03-10-T-011,737,Joan Pereira,"The best way, really, is through mediation, with trained personnel who have the necessary knowledge and skillsets for the problem at hand. With a mediator, whom all stakeholders can acknowledge and respect, the chances of resolving the problem is much higher. Would the Ministry elaborate on how it will bring disputing parties together to resolve such issues?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00738,2022-03-10-T-011,738,Joan Pereira,"We must also educate our people about the customs of different races and religions, so that we can be more mindful and avoid potentially offensive behaviour. We must be respectful of one another's differences and widen the common space. There are often complaints of noise disturbances or certain practices of religious or cultural events and festivities. As we approach the 20th anniversary of IRCCs in 2022, what are MCCY's plans to ensure that our IRCCs remain relevant and effective in maintaining racial and religious harmony and strengthening our social cohesion?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00739,2022-03-10-T-011,739,Cheng Li Hui,"Madam, over the past two years, we have weathered the challenges brought on by COVID-19, hand-in-hand, both the Government and people. As a result, we are in a much stronger position today even as we ride out the current Omicron wave and look forward to a better future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00740,2022-03-10-T-011,740,Cheng Li Hui,"I was reminded of it recently during the Tampines East Edusave Ceremony when this lady said ""Hi Miss Cheng, we finally meet"". It turns out that she is the chairlady of her company's CSR and she had mobilised the team to help out in our mask-making during the circuit breaker. We had only corresponded via emails and phone. I remembered then, Standard Chartered Bank also listed my email on their CSR portal and I would get dozens of emails daily asking ""How can I help?"" The logistics company, taxi driver and fabric supplier who helped, all declined payment. It was their way of contributing to fight the pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00741,2022-03-10-T-011,741,Cheng Li Hui,"Many would have also heard of neighbours helping one another with grocery purchase, mask and sanitiser collection, especially for their elderly neighbours. Our cohesiveness as a nation has strengthened over the pandemic years."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00742,2022-03-10-T-011,742,Cheng Li Hui,"Chairman, this cohesiveness among our people and the trust in the Government that we have in Singapore are precious. In many other parts of the world, we have seen how the pandemic had aggravated existing fault lines and even created tensions between the government and people, with anti-vaccination and anti-mask protests. These tensions made it more challenging to deal with the pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00743,2022-03-10-T-011,743,Cheng Li Hui,Can the Ministry share how we can continue to build upon this spirit of care and strengthen community cohesiveness in Singapore? How can we make volunteerism and care a part of our lives and match like-minded people to the causes that they are interested in?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00744,2022-03-10-T-011,744,Cheng Li Hui,"Madam, religious and racial harmony is an important part of our social fabric. We are all aware of how racial riots rocked Singapore in the 1960s. Although many years have gone by, that period holds important lessons for us. From time to time, racist incidents happen and we are reminded that building a multiracial and multi-religious society is, indeed, a work in progress."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00745,2022-03-10-T-011,745,Cheng Li Hui,"Take, for example, last year, there was a viral video showing a confrontation between a man and an inter-racial couple. We may not have the full facts of what happened, but many of us were rightly disturbed and worried after watching it."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00746,2022-03-10-T-011,746,Cheng Li Hui,"We must never waver in our commitment to promote harmony among our people. Therefore, the role of our IRCCs is even more important. When I was a young volunteer, I remember IRCCs organising excursions to Hindu temples, churches and we had buka puasa over nasi dulang in mosques and got to know one another's religion better. Unfortunately, IRCCs stopped having these programmes years ago."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00747,2022-03-10-T-011,747,Cheng Li Hui,What are MCCY's plans to ensure the relevance of IRCCs and its role in strengthening our social cohesion?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00748,2022-03-10-T-011,748,,Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman. Please take your two cuts together.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00749,2022-03-10-T-011,749,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"Yes, Madam. In 2020, MHA spotted a spike in race and religion-related Police cases. Last year, we heard about anecdotes where racial remarks were made against Singaporeans. For instance, an ex-Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer made unwelcomed remarks about an interracial couple last year, triggering a slew of responses from the public. The occurrence of such incidents has thus reminded us of the need to show the greatest tolerance and respect for one another."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00750,2022-03-10-T-011,750,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"MCCY has also stepped up its efforts to tackle racism and racial discrimination in Singapore. In response to several Parliamentary Questions raised last year, MCCY mentioned it adopts a multi-pronged approach in combating racism and racial discrimination."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00751,2022-03-10-T-011,751,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"MCCY's approach mainly constitutes enforcement and legal framework, encouraging respectful online behaviour, encouraging conversations on the topics of race and religion as well as enlarging the common spaces. These four elements of MCCY's approach would be essential in ensuring that Singapore society remains resilient and cohesive as we transition to a post-pandemic future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00752,2022-03-10-T-011,752,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"Given MCCY's efforts in promoting social harmony in Singapore, can it provide an update on efforts to continue rallying Singaporeans to step up on integration efforts and build a more cohesive society? Moreover, can MCCY elaborate on its upcoming plans to step up on our social cohesion efforts and partner Singaporeans to bridge existing societal fault lines?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00753,2022-03-10-T-011,753,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"The findings of the Individual Giving Survey by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) in 2021 showed that regular volunteerism took a hit mainly due to the measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19, with nearly half of the volunteers saying that they have volunteered less since DORSCON Orange was alerted on 7 February 2020."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00754,2022-03-10-T-011,754,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"NVPC polled more than 2,000 people between 8 April and 17 September 2021 for the study. They noted that 48% of volunteers volunteered less since DORSCON Orange was declared on 7 February 2020. On the other hand, the survey also showed that online giving rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an overall decline in volunteerism."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00755,2022-03-10-T-011,755,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"Notably, online volunteering sign-ups in Singapore saw a 29% increase and online donation rose 37%, compared to pre-pandemic levels."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00756,2022-03-10-T-011,756,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"In light of these findings, could MCCY share how it plans to leverage the growth of online volunteerism and provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to step forward? Moreover, could MCCY also elaborate on its efforts to reframe the public's impression of volunteerism, often associated with labour-intensive work and perceived as separate from one's social or professional lives. Are there online efforts to make volunteerism and care a part of the Singaporean way of life?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00757,2022-03-10-T-011,757,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Could MCCY also share its plans to provide opportunities for Singaporeans to serve others using their skills and talent and galvanise like-minded people to work together on social and community causes that interest them?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00758,2022-03-10-T-011,758,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"Finally, what is being done to better promote and match volunteers to the needs on the ground?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00759,2022-03-10-T-011,759,Koh Lian Pin,"Madam, our youths are our future. We should engage and encourage them to participate and contribute actively to matters of national concern that will impact our society in the long run."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00760,2022-03-10-T-011,760,Koh Lian Pin,"Over the years, MCCY has announced numerous initiatives, such as the Youth Action Challenge and digital engagements, to engage our youth and seek their views. Could the Ministry share its plans to provide even more opportunities for the civic participation of our youths from diverse backgrounds on topics of national interest, such as the review of our nationally determined contributions and other sustainability goals?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00761,2022-03-10-T-011,761,Koh Lian Pin,"Additionally, what are the Government's plans to support our youths in taking ground-up actions on social and environmental causes they are passionate about?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00762,2022-03-10-T-011,762,,"Mr Mark Chay, please take your two cuts together."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00763,2022-03-10-T-011,763,Mark Chay,"Mdm Chairman, I am aware that MCCY has been engaging citizens through different platforms, such as the Emerging Stronger Conversations, which was launched as part of the Singapore Together Movement in June 2020. There are also Conversations on Singapore Women's Development and OnePeople.sg."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00764,2022-03-10-T-011,764,Mark Chay,"Creating these platforms is commendable and well-intentioned, with the goal of bringing Singaporeans to work with one another for a better future. Feedback is critical for growth and I would like to request that MCCY provide an update on the progress of these conversations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00765,2022-03-10-T-011,765,Mark Chay,"I am aware that these discussions typically span a wide range of topics, such as national identity, care for the elderly, technology, governance and so on. The impact of these dialogues would provide reliable insights into the state and progress of our nation in different areas."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00766,2022-03-10-T-011,766,Mark Chay,"It is, therefore, important that MCCY answers the following questions. How have these conversations translated into concrete and measurable action? How will MCCY continue to provide Singaporeans with opportunities to contribute ideas and work towards our vision of a caring, just and equal society?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00767,2022-03-10-T-011,767,Mark Chay,The world is changing in so many ways. What we do for entertainment today will be replaced by emerging ideas and innovations.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00768,2022-03-10-T-011,768,Mark Chay,"The future of entertainment is firmly rooted in digitisation and technology. Netflix, for instance, has revolutionised the entertainment industry by giving customers original and high-quality on-demand content available to people regardless of location. Other platforms, such as Twitch and YouTube, take live content to hundreds of millions of viewers around the world."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00769,2022-03-10-T-011,769,Mark Chay,"On the future of entertainment, I would like to discuss two points  first, the need for enabling technology and the metaverse; and second, the importance of adapting to hybrid and digital events."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00770,2022-03-10-T-011,770,Mark Chay,"Mdm Chairman, entertainment platforms and opportunities will almost be exclusive to the Metaverse in the not-too-distant future. This will serve as the future for many things we are currently doing today. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), e-commerce and the integration of collectibles give the audience ownership of their fan experience. These will enhance interactions between users and their favourite teams."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00771,2022-03-10-T-011,771,Mark Chay,"It would be highly beneficial to Singapore if the Ministry could encourage digital content and technologies to facilitate interaction between the real and virtual worlds. I would like the Ministry to consider a gaming, technology and digital content hub. This hub can bring Singapore significant economic opportunities, be an incubator for human capital development and, most importantly, a gateway to youths and community engagement."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00772,2022-03-10-T-011,772,Mark Chay,"I am now moving on to my next point, the need to adapt to hybrid and digital events."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00773,2022-03-10-T-011,773,Mark Chay,"As Singapore opens post-COVID-19, rather than making digital versions of traditional physical experiences, events need to leverage digital and hybrid extensions to engage audiences better. Singapore needs to encourage the arts and sports sectors to adapt."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00774,2022-03-10-T-011,774,Mark Chay,"In the sports and arts industry, COVID-19 testing and safe management measures (SMMs) will remain for the foreseeable future. I want to encourage the Ministry to work together with event organisers and venues to ensure the safety of participants and spectators. We must also keep in mind the viability and sustainability of such events to create practical SMMs that make sense to everyone involved."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00775,2022-03-10-T-011,775,Mark Chay,"Inclusivity and accessibility must be at the forefront of these experiences. Inclusion cannot be a fringe initiative. We must be proactive in designing and producing content that recognises and considers essential demographics. Gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, language, religion, physical and mental abilities and socio-economic status are important parameters that we must not neglect."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00776,2022-03-10-T-011,776,Mark Chay,"Singapore is our home. We want a future filled with opportunities and security for our families. Sports and the arts are, arguably, the two most universal and influential languages we have. I seek clarity on how the Ministry intends to encourage and promote diverse participation in sports and the arts. I would like to ask the Ministry how it can empower the underrepresented and marginalised populations to feel included via sports and the arts."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00777,2022-03-10-T-011,777,Janet Ang,"Mdm Chairman, our arts and culture scene in Singapore plays an essential role in bringing people together from diverse backgrounds and generations. Here, in Singapore, we are very fortunate to enjoy widespread access to arts and heritage facilities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00778,2022-03-10-T-011,778,Janet Ang,"Pre-COVID-19, we were able to enjoy creative offerings by both local and international artists. As we emerge from COVID-19, I believe we need to redouble our efforts in bringing back arts and culture into our community and not undermine the many aspects of what it can offer, of which I will discuss two."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00779,2022-03-10-T-011,779,Janet Ang,"One  a challenge for society in recent years is that with online and social media, we risk taking out bigotry into the virtual space and echo chambers get formed very quickly. COVID-19 has probably made things worse. Society is becoming more polarised, more divisive. I believe that arts can offer a safe space for difficult issues to be discussed, but also a space where differences can be better understood."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00780,2022-03-10-T-011,780,Janet Ang,"One example is A Tapestry of Sacred Music, which is a month-long festival at the Esplanade taking place, in fact, this month."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00781,2022-03-10-T-011,781,Janet Ang,"How precious it is that music from different faiths, traditions and communities can coexist? This is also very much a part of what it means to be Singaporean – our ability to appreciate and celebrate our diversity."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00782,2022-03-10-T-011,782,Janet Ang,Two  another challenge coming out of COVID-19 is that the most vulnerable in society as well as our young have had that quality of human interaction greatly diminished. The arts and cultural spaces are ways for us to safely rebuild that sense of community.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00783,2022-03-10-T-011,783,Janet Ang,"Tough issues, for example, bullying, which is an increasing challenge our young people face today can be more comfortably discussed by kids, parents and teachers when presented in art form. In fact, the annual March On festival is back at the Esplanade with many activities for the young, but also a theatre production and workshops about bullying."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00784,2022-03-10-T-011,784,Janet Ang,"For the young, in particular, art can help kids open up, offer a way for them to learn about themselves and the world more holistically, to develop empathy, imagination but also an appreciation of Singapore in the world."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00785,2022-03-10-T-011,785,Janet Ang,"I have two quick questions. May I ask how MCCY will continue to develop vibrant and inclusive arts and cultural spaces to provide opportunities for diverse communities, especially those who are underserved and vulnerable?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00786,2022-03-10-T-011,786,Janet Ang,"My second question is that the Arts and Culture Resilience Package was much appreciated by our community. Going forward, to ensure a vibrant, resilient ecosystem for the arts and culture sector, how will MCCY plan to build back this community to co-create new innovative and sustainable models together with actors across the value chain, in this sector?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00787,2022-03-10-T-011,787,Janet Ang,"Arts and culture have and can play an important part to bolster our fraternity, solidarity and mettle. Let me close with a quote by Howard Schultz of Starbucks, ""When you are surrounded by people who share a passionate commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible."""
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00788,2022-03-10-T-011,788,,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin. Please take your four cuts together.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00789,2022-03-10-T-011,789,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mdm Chairman, in every country, arts and heritage play a pivotal role in connecting communities and instilling pride and optimism towards the future. It is an essential part of nation building. We are very proud of how far our artists and cultural institutions have come over the years. We must, therefore, ensure that we do our utmost in continuing to support them in the best way possible."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00790,2022-03-10-T-011,790,Sitoh Yih Pin,"The COVID-19 pandemic, as we know, put the hard brakes on the positive development in the arts. The cancellation of productions, the drastic drop in tourist numbers and reduced audience size severely affected the arts sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00791,2022-03-10-T-011,791,Sitoh Yih Pin,"MCCY has been cognisant of this and, in an effort to uplift the sector through the pandemic, introduced the Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) to protect livelihoods and build capabilities. The ACRP was enhanced with $20 million in March 2021, bringing it to a total of $75 million over two years."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00792,2022-03-10-T-011,792,Sitoh Yih Pin,"At the Committee of Supply last year, MCCY had shared that the first tranche of the ACRP created over 13,000 work and training opportunities, of which, 5,000 were for self-employed practitioners. It also supported over 1,400 digitalisation projects."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00793,2022-03-10-T-011,793,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I, therefore, invite the Minister to share with this House an update on the impact of the ACRP and the support provided to cultural organisations and self-employed persons."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00794,2022-03-10-T-011,794,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Given that we are in a much better position now to resume more and more arts and culture activities progressively in line with what the national health situation allows, I also invite the Minister to share MCCY's strategies to revitalise the arts sector as we move forward into the new normal, so as to ensure that our arts groups and practitioners are well-positioned to thrive in the years ahead."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00795,2022-03-10-T-011,795,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Having adequate funding is a key component for any project or programme to achieve the goals set. The arts, culture and heritage sectors are no different."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00796,2022-03-10-T-011,796,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Beyond Government funding, the private and people sectors are key partners of the arts and culture community. Philanthropy has, traditionally, been an important source of funding for the arts groups and practitioners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00797,2022-03-10-T-011,797,Sitoh Yih Pin,"The Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) supports the endeavour to attract private cash donations as it provides dollar-for-dollar matching grants to registered charities in the arts, culture and heritage sectors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00798,2022-03-10-T-011,798,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Over the years, this has boosted private sector giving significantly and is also well-received by arts groups. I note that MCCY had shared at the Comittee of Supply 2021 that a review of the CMF would be conducted, with a view towards an additional top-up of the fund. This top-up was announced by Finance Minister Lawrence Wong in his Budget 2022 Statement."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00799,2022-03-10-T-011,799,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I, therefore, invite the Minister to provide an update on the outcome of the review and to share with us MCCY's strategies to ensure a sustainable arts, culture and heritage ecosystem where Singaporeans can contribute and play a part in."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00800,2022-03-10-T-011,800,Sitoh Yih Pin,The National Arts Council (NAC) and the National Heritage Board (NHB) had previously launched the SG Arts and Heritage Plans which identified the priorities for Singapore's arts and heritage development for 2018 to 2022.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00801,2022-03-10-T-011,801,Sitoh Yih Pin,Both Plans set out bold visions to champion and cultivate the appreciation and development of the arts and our heritage. We are now at the tail end of both plans. I understand that NAC and NHB have started engagements for the next iterations of both plans.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00802,2022-03-10-T-011,802,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I, therefore, invite the Minister to share with this House an update on the progress of the plans, whether MCCY is of the view that both plans managed to succeed in what they had set out to achieve and an elaboration, if any, on the development of the next five-year plans for these sectors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00803,2022-03-10-T-011,803,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Madam, I would also like to add that we must recognise that we have many talented artists and cultural practitioners in Singapore who can make important contributions to the future economy of Singapore. It is, therefore, important as we look ahead that the Government considers the development of the culture and creative economy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00804,2022-03-10-T-011,804,Sitoh Yih Pin,"One way that we can do so is to enable our cultural organisations and practitioners to capture new opportunities, such as those in adjacent sectors within the creative economy and those brought about by digital technology."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00805,2022-03-10-T-011,805,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Seen in these perspectives, I invite the Minister to share MCCY's strategies to bring our arts and culture to new and further heights in the future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00806,2022-03-10-T-011,806,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Our heritage plays an important role in understanding who we are as a nation. It represents a part of our shared history. As a multiracial and multicultural society, it is pivotal that we preserve and promote our heritage, as it is a core ingredient in building our national identity and sense of belonging as a people."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00807,2022-03-10-T-011,807,Sitoh Yih Pin,"We must, therefore, always remain committed to safeguarding our heritage for future generations of Singaporeans."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00808,2022-03-10-T-011,808,Sitoh Yih Pin,"One example is the successful inscription of our Hawker Culture on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of Humanity. Hawker culture is part and parcel of the everyday life of Singaporeans. It is a place where we come together to enjoy a meal together. From traditional favourites, such as chicken rice, nasi lemak or mee goreng, to new fusion options, such as chicken chop laksa spaghetti or smoked salmon and lala congee, our hawker food culture has evolved and grown into something that is distinctly Singaporean. And we should all be very proud of it."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00809,2022-03-10-T-011,809,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I, therefore, invite the Minister to share MCCY's plans to further safeguard and celebrate our shared heritage and how we can continue to engage the community to sustain interest in, and deepen our appreciation for our cultural heritage."

2022-03-10-T-011-S-00811,2022-03-10-T-011,811,Tin Pei Ling,"Arts and culture require human interactions and space for expression. However, COVID-19 has impeded human interactions. Most Singaporeans in this industry are self-employed and have no organisational support. It is inevitable that they were hit harder during the pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00812,2022-03-10-T-011,812,Tin Pei Ling,"The Government launched the ACRP earlier. How is the progress so far and how is the Government helping arts and cultural workers to hone their craft while sustaining their livelihood? With the rapid advancement of digital technology, how do we help these workers use digital platforms to create creative products and enter new markets? How will the Government revitalise the diverse cultural and arts scenes in Singapore and ensure that Singapore continues to have our unique position in the world?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00813,2022-03-10-T-011,813,,Mr Darryl David. Please take your four cuts together.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00814,2022-03-10-T-011,814,Darryl David,"Mdm Chairman, the cultural and creative sectors of our economy are crucial in their own right in terms of their economic footprint and the employment opportunities that they offer across the board. At the same time, we cannot underestimate the innovation that the arts and culture sectors spur across the economy. With wellness and inclusion as key focuses, the arts and culture also offer channels for positive social impact. They encourage education about Singapore's identity, as well as revitalise our city life."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00815,2022-03-10-T-011,815,Darryl David,"Yet, the arts and culture sector has been hard hit by the pandemic and has been severely disrupted by it. In addition to short-term support for artists and firms, which comes from both the public and private sectors, policies can also leverage the economic and social impacts of culture in their broader recovery packages and efforts to transform our economy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00816,2022-03-10-T-011,816,Darryl David,"With COVID-19, digital presentations have provided a lifeline, allowing audiences a new experience in the consumption of the arts. The digital space has provided both opportunities and challenges for local arts groups as they overcome the safe distancing measures and cross into a digital space that is not limited by physical boundaries. Yet, there is also a need to reimagine the business models used in the arts and culture sector, so that they are sustainable. Offering free programmes worked for the short run but the arts also need to be monetised. Effort needs to be placed on the protection of intellectual property in the digital space. Manpower planning and growth are also crucial as the arts groups rethink how to increase capabilities to augment the production quality of digital works."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00817,2022-03-10-T-011,817,Darryl David,"Additionally, talent needs to be boosted through the exploration of new ways of blending digital formats with real-life arts and culture offerings. Training programmes for freelancers and collaborations with the private sector players are some of the ways to further talent growth to ensure sustained development of the arts and culture sectors. What are MCCY's strategies to revitalise the arts and culture sectors and ensure that our organisations and freelancers are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00818,2022-03-10-T-011,818,Darryl David,"Can MCCY provide an update on the impact of ACRP and the support provided to organisations and freelancers? Can MCCY elaborate on its plans to further strengthen the socio-economic nexus of our arts and culture sector, including manpower development and plans for digitalisation, to ensure that our artists are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00819,2022-03-10-T-011,819,Darryl David,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on sports participation on many levels, including the cancelling or scaling down of mass participation events. Safe distancing measures, as well as concerns about the danger of large clusters forming, have had an impact on sports participation. At the same time, there are new developments in sports aimed at coping with the limitations of safe distancing measures."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00820,2022-03-10-T-011,820,Darryl David,"Capacity constraints in sporting venues and the limitations on the way team sport can be engaged have resulted in innovations. An example of innovative approaches to physical space are emerging, such as the use of small box gyms that offer physical fitness enthusiasts a new and different lease of life."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00821,2022-03-10-T-011,821,Darryl David,"Yet, sports and the communal nature of many sporting activities have a huge role to play in the psycho-social aspects of life. These benefits include cooperation, coping with confidence and shyness issues, dealing with stress and coping with aggression and violence. Sports can help curb social isolation and serve as a catharsis or outlet for those dealing with emotional issues."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00822,2022-03-10-T-011,822,Darryl David,"Sports also play a critical and important role in bringing Singaporeans together. Sports, whether it is through participation or spectatorship, foster a sense of pride and build a confident nation, through interaction with athletes or sports fan bases."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00823,2022-03-10-T-011,823,Darryl David,"To paraphrase Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, ""The important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight; the essential thing is not to have won, but to have fought well."" So, in this regard, sports can be used to develop an individual's resilience as well."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00824,2022-03-10-T-011,824,Darryl David,"Can MCCY share its strategies to bring sports participation back into the new normal? Can MCCY also share its strategies to restore and reinvigorate national sports participation, increase access to sports facilities and reintroduce mass sports events in a safe manner?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00825,2022-03-10-T-011,825,Darryl David,"Sports have the ability to reinforce the idea of the importance of equality. For the fourth Paralympics in a row, Singapore's para-athletes have come back with a haul of medals, in spite of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Athletes, such as Yip Pin Xiu and Paraglider Jessica Goh, have gunned for gold, winning the hearts of Singaporeans. Other para-athletes, such as archer Nur Syahidah Alim, cyclists Steve Tee and competition partner Ang Kee Meng, have shown how sports can build an inclusive society through opportunities for talent to shine."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00826,2022-03-10-T-011,826,Darryl David,"In October last year, it was reported that Yip Pin Xiu will receive $800,000 for the two gold medals she won at the Tokyo Paralympic Games in August 2021. It is, indeed, commendable that sponsors, such as DBS and the Tote Board, have stepped in with the cash awards to help the athletes and reward them for their sacrifice. The work of the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC), which focuses on enabling our elite para-athletes to participate in major games, such as the ASEAN Para Games, Asian Para Games, Asian Youth Para Games, Commonwealth Games and Paralympic Games, has also been crucial as the SNPC has undertaken collaborations to enable our para-athletes to soar."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00827,2022-03-10-T-011,827,Darryl David,"It is important to leverage the international success of these para-athletes to encourage more sports participation at all levels. So, what is MCCY doing to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports? In line with MCCY's commitment in the Parliament Motion last year to honour our athletes, what is MCCY doing to support para-athletes and provide more opportunities for our aspiring para-athletes, especially for those who wish to pursue sports at a competitive level to represent Singapore in the international arena?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00828,2022-03-10-T-011,828,Darryl David,Can MCCY also elaborate on its strategies to provide more inclusiveness through sports in the next phase of the Disability Sports Master Plan?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00829,2022-03-10-T-011,829,Darryl David,"In sports, ""it is not the will to win that matters but the will to prepare to win"", according to Paul ""Bear"" Bryant, the late American football coach. At some of the major games such as the Southeast Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games, major games preparation is an important ingredient in the athletes' preparation to enhance performance and recovery."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00830,2022-03-10-T-011,830,Darryl David,"Madam, these games and the results achieved can only be reinforced through advance planning and real-time involvement and investment in scientific methods. Effort also needs to be placed on minimising the distractions and stress faced by athletes during games time, enabling them to focus on their performance."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00831,2022-03-10-T-011,831,Darryl David,"There is also much behind-the scenes work by organisations, such as Sports Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), that have collaborated to prepare for major games to deliver preparation plans, games preparation workshops, performance analysis. Enhanced sports medicine, as well as sports science, are being employed to support athletes in their games preparations. There is also the need to invest time and funds in coaching and providing the best in terms of infrastructure, programmes and sports facilities, so that our athletes can thrive stress-free and focused on delivering an optimum performance."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00832,2022-03-10-T-011,832,Darryl David,"Mdm Chairman, given the pressures that they face, athletes' mental health is just as crucial, so that they can deal with the pressure that intense competition brings. All these preparation and investment are only meaningful and possible if there is psychological support for the athletes and their efforts."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00833,2022-03-10-T-011,833,Darryl David,Can MCCY provide an update on how Team Singapore athletes are progressing in their preparation for the major games in 2022 and beyond? What efforts are underway to rally Singaporeans to support Team Singapore? Sports have the potential to galvanise and inspire the nation. Can MCCY share its efforts to rally Singaporeans to show their support for Team Singapore and also to provide platforms for Team Singapore athletes to connect with and inspire Singaporeans?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00834,2022-03-10-T-011,834,Cheng Li Hui,"Mdm Chairman, in December 2021, it was reported that about 85,000 fans turned out at our National Stadium to watch the 16 Suzuki Cup football matches. That was the biggest mass sports event in Singapore since the pandemic. It brought together many Singaporeans from all walks of life to cheer on the Lions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00835,2022-03-10-T-011,835,Cheng Li Hui,"For some of us, the matches certainly brought back the fond memories of the Kallang Roar at the old National Stadium. Many of us who grew up watching Malaysia Cup will fondly remember Fandi, Sundramoorthy and super-sub Steven Tan. Actually, my family really scream every time Steven Tan comes on."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00836,2022-03-10-T-011,836,Cheng Li Hui,"Those were the days, but Mdm Chairman, the recent Suzuki cup is a good first step to revive our national sports scenes and to reignite interest in sports. Such sporting events unite Singaporeans and foster a strong sense of pride."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00837,2022-03-10-T-011,837,Cheng Li Hui,"I would like to ask the Ministry for an update on the ""Unleash the Roar"" project and its vision to unite Singaporeans of all ages, races and gender through football."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00838,2022-03-10-T-011,838,Cheng Li Hui,"Madam, since the pandemic hit us in 2020, the various measures put in place meant that we had no choice but to reduce our participation in sporting events and matches. National sports participation has also been severely disrupted and the facilities bookings limited."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00839,2022-03-10-T-011,839,Cheng Li Hui,What are the Ministry's plans to restore national sports participation and reintroduce mass sports events in a safe manner?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00840,2022-03-10-T-011,840,Cheng Li Hui,"Madam, before the pandemic, we used to hold free bowling clinics in Tampines East during school holidays for children from lower-income families. We would reserve two lanes for differently-abled children and engage a coach from the Bowling Association for Disabled (Singapore) to guide them. Subsequently, Our Tampines Hub also held a once-off beginner cycling session for differently-abled children. These programmes were very welcomed by their parents. These children require special guidance and there is a lack of suitable programmes for them. It would be wonderful if they can join their families for cycling or bowling events after this training."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00841,2022-03-10-T-011,841,Cheng Li Hui,"On the national stage, many Singaporeans also cheered on Yip Pin Xiu and our Paralympic team in the Tokyo Paralympics last year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00842,2022-03-10-T-011,842,Cheng Li Hui,Can the Ministry elaborate on its strategies to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports in our Disability Sports Master Plan? How can we provide more opportunities for our aspiring para-athletes to pursue sports at a competitive level?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00843,2022-03-10-T-011,843,,Minister Edwin Tong.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00844,2022-03-10-T-011,844,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mdm Chairperson, this pandemic has affected our daily lives in almost every respect. As Mr Sitoh Yih Pin points out, this crisis of a generation has tested the very core of our resilience as a society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00845,2022-03-10-T-011,845,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MCCY and our stakeholders have felt this very keenly. We are a people-oriented, people-focused and community-building Ministry."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00846,2022-03-10-T-011,846,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Community and camaraderie are the bedrock of cohesion. This, however, requires the coming together of people, which is something that we have not been able to do quite so easily."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00847,2022-03-10-T-011,847,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Arts, culture, heritage, religion and sport, to name a few, are critical pieces in our country's path towards development and progress. They give us our unique sense of identity, instil pride in us as the people of Singapore and foster a collectively stronger, more cohesive community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00848,2022-03-10-T-011,848,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,These are the foundational cornerstones of our society.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00849,2022-03-10-T-011,849,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The pandemic has underscored just how important those pieces are. Hence, when Singaporeans interact less, when our young people stop playing sports with one another, when Singaporeans do not come together to enjoy cultural and community events together, the bonds that bind us will gradually weaken. The long-term effects, if not addressed, may erode our sense of ""us"" in years to come. And we will suffer a deficit in social trust."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00850,2022-03-10-T-011,850,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, in these unprecedentedly difficult times, we will redouble our efforts to replenish and fortify the connections that bring us together. Our arts, heritage and sports sectors are that critical social ""glue"" that binds us together, instils pride and gives us a warm sense of belonging to our Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00851,2022-03-10-T-011,851,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To strengthen the threads of our social fabric, we must deepen the partnership amongst Singaporeans and with the Government. This is the spirit of Singapore Together, where Singaporeans shared their post-COVID-19 aspirations for society during the Emerging Stronger Conversations (ESC) conversations that were concluded last year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00852,2022-03-10-T-011,852,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Mark Chay asked about the progress of the ESCs. We have been working with Singaporeans to translate these aspirations into reality. Conversation must, therefore, become action. In this vein, 31 Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfAs), involving over 34,000 individuals from the people, private and public sectors were formed to address key themes, for example, the AfA on Lower-Wage Workers, which spearheaded eight ground-up projects to uplift lower-wage workers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00853,2022-03-10-T-011,853,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The ESCs and AfAs were convened in spite of COVID-19, because Singaporeans wanted to come together to rebuild our Singapore together. We will do more to harness this spirit and to work collaboratively with the public."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00854,2022-03-10-T-011,854,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our arts and culture practitioners were put through a difficult period. We navigated it, with financial support and targeted support. But we know that, ultimately, audiences are the life blood of the arts. Therefore, the resumption of arts and culture activities in a safe manner has been a priority for us."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00855,2022-03-10-T-011,855,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over the past year, we have allowed more activities to resume safely as we continued to simplify and streamline safe management measures (SMMs). We increased the number of audiences and participants who can enjoy these activities. We simplified SMMs for performers and crew, so that larger productions can be staged, especially international productions, and we provided support to preserve core capabilities and ensure a smooth resumption of activities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00856,2022-03-10-T-011,856,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Whilst the situation remains dynamic, MCCY and our agencies will continue to advocate on behalf of the arts and culture, and the sports sectors, for a safe reopening. We remain committed to supporting our sectors through this recovery."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00857,2022-03-10-T-011,857,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Government will introduce the Small Business Recovery Grant (SBRG) and will also extend the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) to end-2022. This will help support small organisations, as well as lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed persons (SEPs) affected by the COVID-19 restrictions, including those in the arts and culture sector, and the sports sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00858,2022-03-10-T-011,858,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Darryl David, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about the impact of the $75 million Arts, Culture and Resilience Package (ACRP), which was introduced in April 2020. The ACRP demonstrated the Government's clear commitment towards supporting the arts, culture and heritage sectors since the pandemic started. This support was critical, safeguarding jobs and livelihoods, and also protecting talent in the sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00859,2022-03-10-T-011,859,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The ACRP and broad-based support schemes supported over 900 arts and culture organisations. Of these, 241 organisations were supported under the ACRP Operating Grant, to sustain operations and make for more nimble adjustments in response to the pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00860,2022-03-10-T-011,860,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We understood how SMMs and venue capacity limits weighed painfully on the sector, with lower revenues arising from reduced audiences or visitor capacities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00861,2022-03-10-T-011,861,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To support our arts groups, we introduced the Venue Hire Subsidy (VHS) to defray performance costs. This encouraged the resumption of activities and also brought back vibrancy to our arts and cultural scene, with more than 1,700 live performances and other cultural events supported in 2020 and 2021."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00862,2022-03-10-T-011,862,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For example, the re SOUND collective made use of the VHS to hold a concert, Tapestry with Jeremy Monteiro. This was held at the Singapore Conference Hall. Likewise, groups like Pangdemonium and The Singapore Ballet also utilised the VHS. I was present at Tapestry some weeks ago. I was present at the Singapore Ballet a few nights ago and I will be present at Pangdemonium's performance this Saturday at the Victoria Theatre. I hope that Members will also support the arts in the same way."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00863,2022-03-10-T-011,863,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,We also used the ACRP to provide opportunities through digitalisation and transformation to meet future challenges.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00864,2022-03-10-T-011,864,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over 1,500 digitalisation projects were supported under the ACRP through the Digitalisation Fund, including the Digital Presentation Grant (DPG). This allowed the sector to obtain invaluable experience innovating in these new frontiers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00865,2022-03-10-T-011,865,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Together with the Capability Development Scheme for the Arts (CDSA), we created close to 15,000 work and training opportunities for the sector in 2020."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00866,2022-03-10-T-011,866,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the back of these gains, we took a longer-term view in 2021 – when we understood the pandemic a little more and we understood the sectors a little better. We wanted to look beyond the pandemic and position the sector for a strong recovery post-COVID-19 and in the mid- to longer-term. With the second tranche of the ACRP, we supported transformation efforts that encouraged even greater collaboration within the sector to explore opportunities, share best practices and come together to tackle common issues."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00867,2022-03-10-T-011,867,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,More than 100 transformation projects by over 190 organisations were supported by the Organisation Transformation Grant (OTG).
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00868,2022-03-10-T-011,868,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Self-employed persons (SEPs) and organisations also came together to develop projects supported by the SEP Grant (SEPG), creating over 5,000 work and training opportunities for our SEPs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00869,2022-03-10-T-011,869,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We will fully utilise the $75 million for the ACRP by the end of this Financial Year (FY). To build on the gains that we have made, we will provide an additional $12 million in FY2022 in continued support of our arts and culture practitioners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00870,2022-03-10-T-011,870,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The VHS will also be extended. Last year, we incorporated the CDSA and DPG into NAC and NHB's ongoing grants and, this year, we will also incorporate the OTG and SEPG."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00871,2022-03-10-T-011,871,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ms Janet Ang asked how we will continue to provide vibrant arts and culture spaces, and about our plans to co-create new models for the sector. Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about our efforts to revitalise the sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00872,2022-03-10-T-011,872,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, they are right. We must act proactively to protect and sustain a thriving and innovative arts and culture sector. If arts and culture become unintended casualties of the pandemic, we will lose a sense of who we are as a nation and what makes us special as a people."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00873,2022-03-10-T-011,873,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Therefore, we will work with the community to ensure that the sector remains vibrant, innovative, and more importantly, forward-looking, and continues to provide good and meaningful jobs. That the landscape continues to reflect our shared values, our ethos and our social mores, inspires and uplifts us and forges a strong sense of national identity."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00874,2022-03-10-T-011,874,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Our key focus areas are
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00875,2022-03-10-T-011,875,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, digitalisation as a key enabler for the sector to engage new and existing audiences and complement existing revenue streams. To encourage more widespread digital adoption, we worked closely with stakeholders and tech partners to develop the Arts and Culture Digital Roadmap which was launched in February this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00876,2022-03-10-T-011,876,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, enhancing conditions for our SEPs. Our arts and culture landscape depends heavily on the rich talent of our freelancers. They are creative and talented and are a source of spontaneity and innovation. We value them and want to help them to continue to thrive and contribute. Therefore, we will work with partners to help SEPs build up their skills, improve working conditions, explore new ways for them to create value in the arts sector and also in the wider creative economy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00877,2022-03-10-T-011,877,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Third, developing vibrant and inclusive arts and culture spaces to keep up with the emerging trends and better meet practitioners' needs. One example is 45 Armenian Street (45AS). We have asked leaders in the arts community to help envision the space and how it can best be operated and managed. I thank the Chair of Art Outreach Mae Anderson, the Vice Chair of Wild Rice Janice Koh, and co-artistic director of Independent Archive Shaiful Risan, as well as other members of the 45AS Resource Panel for so generously sharing their time, expertise and experience with us and also engaging with the wider community, to collaborate with NAC."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00878,2022-03-10-T-011,878,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To ensure that 45AS remains a safe space for artistic experimentation, one that supports the work of our young, emerging practitioners and is always inclusive, multidisciplinary as an arts space. My colleague, Minister of State Low Yen Ling will elaborate further on our focus areas to strengthen the sector."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00879,2022-03-10-T-011,879,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked for an update on the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF). The CMF was set up in 2013 to encourage cultural philanthropy, to push arts and heritage charities to also diversify their income streams via fundraising, with dollar-for-dollar matching of private cash donations to arts and heritage charities. This enhances the resilience of our arts and heritage charities, and there has been an encouragingly strong response to this."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00880,2022-03-10-T-011,880,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Arts and heritage charities received over $300 million in CMF grants, reflecting donations catalysed by the CMF since its inception. To date, a total of 111 arts and heritage charities applied to CMF at least once. These 111 represent over two-thirds of the total number of arts and heritage charities in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00881,2022-03-10-T-011,881,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Many charities have also embarked on their own fundraising for the first time to diversify their revenue streams. We want to sustain the momentum of giving and to encourage charities to keep up fundraising efforts and forge and develop stronger relationships with their own ecosystem of donors. There will, therefore, be a top-up of $150 million into the CMF. The top-up will encourage cultural philanthropy and enhance the sustainability of the arts and heritage sectors. The CMF will complement existing initiatives to provide stronger support to smaller charities to develop their own governance and fundraising capabilities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00882,2022-03-10-T-011,882,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our cultural heritage plays an important role in growing a strong, confident society by anchoring our own unique Singaporean identity and telling stories that are our own and that define and inspire us as a country."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00883,2022-03-10-T-011,883,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Padang, for example, has borne witness to many significant national events. The site is an instantly recognisable enduring testament to our history as a people and as a country. NHB is working towards the gazetting of the Padang as a National Monument on National Day later this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00884,2022-03-10-T-011,884,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, even as we safeguard our tangible heritage, we will continue to preserve and celebrate our intangible heritage. We were very proud some time ago when our hawker culture was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list. We are now looking at a second UNESCO ICH nomination. There are some exciting possibilities. I will not share them here yet. We have sought views on them and we will think about them a bit more, think about how else and what are the possible nominations and will continue to engage with our relevant stakeholders, as well as the public, before reaching a decision."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00885,2022-03-10-T-011,885,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked for an update on our long-term vision for the arts and culture sector. Madam, it is a good question. Even as we work on the here and now, and Members will see that we have many initiatives on the here and now, we have kept a clear eye on the future. Since mid-2021, we have been actively engaging stakeholders in the sector to develop a vision for the next Arts and Heritage Plans and will further engage stakeholders this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00886,2022-03-10-T-011,886,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Arts and Heritage Plans 2.0 will continue to build upon the vital role played by the arts and heritage in deepening our national identity. Again, Minister of State Low Yen Ling will give more details on the Arts and Heritage Plans 2.0."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00887,2022-03-10-T-011,887,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, let me now turn to sports. Mr Darryl David and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about strategies to bring sports participation back, and Mr Mark Chay asked a series of questions about sports entertainment and, in particular, digital content, to promote Singapore's culture and identity. Miss Cheng, in particular, spoke with such passion about the National Stadium. I think she showed her vintage naming those players, but I would suggest that we look forward as well. Irfan Fandi, Gabriel Quak, Jacob Mahler are some names of the future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00888,2022-03-10-T-011,888,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have been supporting the sports and fitness industry to enhance their value proposition through digitalisation, to transform the way they present and, in turn, the way we consume and experience activities and sporting content."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00889,2022-03-10-T-011,889,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The ActiveSG Circle has partnered stakeholders to develop more than 3,000 hours of digital content since 2020 and, to date, has accumulated a viewership of 67 million, with five million unique visitors. This is very encouraging and we will continue with this effort."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00890,2022-03-10-T-011,890,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"SportSG also closely supports the sports and fitness industry in expanding their blended digital and physical offerings, including events and competitions, like the Arena Games Triathlon to be held in May this year, which will blend live and virtual reality experiences for a truly immersive experience."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00891,2022-03-10-T-011,891,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have also been nudging digital production and innovation through the Sports Resilience Package (SRP), which was enhanced to a total of $75 million last year. To date, more than 600 businesses were supported by the SRP. The SRP will sustain the momentum of innovation, such as through the Enterprise Innovation and Capabilities Development Grant (InnoGrant), which supports businesses in applying technology and innovative solutions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00892,2022-03-10-T-011,892,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Through these, some sports businesses are fundamentally transforming the way we experience sports. For example, SportSG's ""Blended"" initiative supports businesses through areas, such as data analytics and fan engagement, so that they can better develop hybrid experiences which better connect with the audience. With Blended's support, 18 hybrid events reached over 90,000 participants. One such event is RIDEnjoySG, an innovative campaign that encourages participants to cycle safely on bike paths and park connectors whilst, at the same time, enjoying real-world rewards via location-based challenges and augmented reality."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00893,2022-03-10-T-011,893,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, 2021 was a thoroughly exciting year for sports, despite the many uncertainties and challenges. We progressively resumed sporting activities and also hosted several international events."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00894,2022-03-10-T-011,894,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In 2022, we want to step it up. Like arts, sports are a social ""glue"" that brings us together, as we cheer on our athletes fighting hard for Singapore, or as we develop friendships by simply engaging in a game or two on the field or on the court."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00895,2022-03-10-T-011,895,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We will commit $20 million to our Bring Sport Back programme in 2022. This is designed to reinvigorate Singapore sports, bring people back to play and enjoy sports together and, through sports, reconnect with one another. Bring Sport Back will focus on three key elements."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00896,2022-03-10-T-011,896,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, we will safely reintroduce mass participation events for all, through more community events and sports festivals. To facilitate this, SportSG will be opening a grant call to fund mass participation events at up to $50,000 per award under the Blended Events Grant – Bring Sport Back edition."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00897,2022-03-10-T-011,897,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, we will ramp up community participation in sports through enhanced programming and more group activities. Currently, more than 170 facilities have already resumed ""5 against 5"" team sports. We are working on resuming larger team sports capacities across more facilities around Singapore, bringing it back to full capacity in several phases. We will roll out more leagues and competitions for people of all ages under the ActiveSG umbrella. These include the ActiveSG Cup launch and ActiveSG Leagues for Athletics, Badminton and Canoeing."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00898,2022-03-10-T-011,898,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"ActiveSG Academies and Clubs will ramp up the capacity of high-quality programmes, to strengthen sport development, social integration, health and wellness and inculcate strong values of resilience and determination, values that one can get through sport participation. They will also offer additional pathways for youth development at the elite level."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00899,2022-03-10-T-011,899,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have also picked up growing interest in pickleball – I think some Members may be familiar with that sport – an increasingly popular sport, particularly amongst our seniors. We will continue to keep our ears to the ground and will, in this case, for pickleball, increase the frequency of this and any other popular activities that will bring people back to sports."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00900,2022-03-10-T-011,900,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Third, we will optimise facilities and spaces to encourage people to return and to play together. These spaces will be community-driven, serving the unique needs of our different neighbourhoods. These include repurposing spaces for a range of sports and converting underused spaces into outdoor gyms. We hope that these measures will encourage Singaporeans to resume sporting and wellness activities safely."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00901,2022-03-10-T-011,901,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, as we raise our ambitions in sports, we also want to emphasise the values that unite and promote an inclusive ""Sense of Us"" – of who we are as fellow Singaporeans."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00902,2022-03-10-T-011,902,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"One of the values that Singaporeans hold dear is inclusivity. We must build a society where everyone, regardless of their own circumstances in life, can take part and can flourish."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00903,2022-03-10-T-011,903,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I appreciate very much Miss Cheng Li Hui's and Mr Darryl David's questions on inclusive sports. There are several aspects to this, for which we have a few broad initiatives. First, SportSG will introduce the Para Sport Academy, under ActiveSG's Academies and Clubs, to create more opportunities for persons with disabilities to pursue their sporting ambition at a competitive level."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00904,2022-03-10-T-011,904,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I spoke during my earlier Parliamentary Motion last year about the unique ability of sports to enhance an individual's own self-confidence and to transform community attitudes towards a person with disabilities.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00905,2022-03-10-T-011,905,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sports are one arena where we can, and, indeed, we should, level everyone up. Through sports, we can empower persons with disabilities in deeply profound ways to help them realise their full potential and raise their visibility and prominence in society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00906,2022-03-10-T-011,906,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For many para-athletes, their stories attest to the value of sports in Singapore, playing a pivotal part in building an inclusive society. The Para Sport Academy will bring us one step closer, one step further along this journey, ensuring our para-athletes will have an equal platform and as much opportunity as any other to scale the pinnacle of sporting excellence."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00907,2022-03-10-T-011,907,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, sports can uplift and motivate. In that spirit, SportCares will be collaborating with ComLink to offer programmes to vulnerable youths, families and seniors. SportCares will also roll out a mentoring programme and will also offer bursaries, scholarships and internships for youths from disadvantaged backgrounds."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00908,2022-03-10-T-011,908,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Both of these initiatives will provide enhanced opportunities for those with disabilities or from less privileged backgrounds to achieve their hopes and dreams and use sports to uplift themselves.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00909,2022-03-10-T-011,909,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"My colleague, Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, will share more details on these two initiatives, as well as other sports developments to look forward to."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00910,2022-03-10-T-011,910,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As Ms Joan Pereira said, this year marks the 20th anniversary of our Inter-racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs). Many Members, in fact, know that our IRCCs have been instrumental in shaping our interfaith harmony over the years. Their mission to strengthen our social cohesion remains as important today as it was 20 years ago, when we first set it up."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00911,2022-03-10-T-011,911,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"IRCC was first formed in 2002, at a time when the world was reeling in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and Singapore had also just uncovered the Jemaah Islamiyah plot to attack embassies on our own soil. We now have IRCCs in every constituency, with over 1,500 members comprising key leaders from various religious organisations, grassroots, community leaders and other stakeholders."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00912,2022-03-10-T-011,912,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The IRCCs have, over the years, been a critical bridge between the different community groups, building bridges, building trust and friendships and just doing day-to-day things, so that the lived experience enhances those bonds. On average, the IRCCs organise over 250 activities each year, including dialogues on different faiths, practices and festivals, and joint collaborations to support one another in times of need. We agree with Ms Joan Pereira that we should do more to open the common spaces, to listen and learn about other faiths, religions and practices, without prejudice. The IRCCs also act as a conduit between the Government and community by highlighting issues emerging on the ground, providing insights and ideas."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00913,2022-03-10-T-011,913,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Fahmi Bin Aliman asked how we plan to step up social cohesion efforts. Ms Joan Pereira and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we plan to keep IRCCs effective and relevant and promote a more inclusive nation.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00914,2022-03-10-T-011,914,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, as a basic requirement, we must ensure that our IRCCs will continue to foster mutual trust on the ground. They are bridges and connectors on the ground across communities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00915,2022-03-10-T-011,915,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At the same time, we are also operating and very quickly moving into a rapidly-changing landscape. We will, therefore, have to refresh our IRCCs, so that they stand ready to respond to future challenges, such as evolving societal attitudes, increasing fault lines and the pervasive impact of social media on race and religious relations, like some Members have highlighted earlier."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00916,2022-03-10-T-011,916,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,We must also anticipate the challenges in the next bound.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00917,2022-03-10-T-011,917,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To this end, we have formed a Workgroup to review how we can refresh our IRCCs to continue strengthening our racial and religious harmony. The Workgroup comprises members who are experienced IRCC leaders, representatives from religious organisations, civil society leaders and groups and community partners as well as youth leaders who play an integral and instrumental part in shaping what we want to be doing in the future to promote racial and religious harmony."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00918,2022-03-10-T-011,918,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over the next few months, the Workgroup will consult widely with a range of community stakeholders, identify the strengths and challenges faced by the IRCCs, look at some of the issues, look at how we can tackle them and put forward their recommendations. I look forward to the Workgroup presenting its recommendations later on this year and I will share them with Members of this House."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00919,2022-03-10-T-011,919,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, Madam, Ms Joan Pereira asked how we can continue to strengthen community life at the neighbourhood level and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we can increase care and cohesiveness in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00920,2022-03-10-T-011,920,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At the heart of our communities and neighbourhoods are the Residents Committees (RC) and Residents' Networks (RN) centres. The way to increase care, cohesiveness, bonds on the ground, is not necessarily to come up with special projects or special events to bring people together, but to share as part of our daily lived experiences. When you step out of your home, when you go down to the common areas in the community, how can we foster that bond?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00921,2022-03-10-T-011,921,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Last October, I had announced that five centres would pilot the smart RC/RN concept, where these centres would be more accessible and better equipped, for example, with smart access control systems, so that residents can access them at a time of their choice."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00922,2022-03-10-T-011,922,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The pilot centres allowed for enhanced use, fostered a greater sense of coming together and community and belonging for the neighbourhoods involved. We will progressively roll out the pilot across more RC centres in the second half of 2022 to take advantage of some of the gains we have seen from the pilot."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00923,2022-03-10-T-011,923,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman and Miss Cheng Li Hui also asked how MCCY plans to make volunteerism and care a greater part of our lives.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00924,2022-03-10-T-011,924,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To do so, the SG Cares movement and People's Association (PA) will generate multiple pathways for volunteerism so that everyone can play a part for the common good."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00925,2022-03-10-T-011,925,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There are several initiatives and I will just highlight one that the PA is studying and will implement shortly. That is, to broaden opportunities for volunteerism on the ground where, as far as possible, we can do it on a fluid, informal and flexible basis. Let me explain that."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00926,2022-03-10-T-011,926,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, working with the community to support volunteers, formal and informal, who wish to work on specific causes. We will support volunteers in causes that they care about."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00927,2022-03-10-T-011,927,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, we want to partner already existing networks on the ground to encourage community involvement and to reach out to potential networks of volunteers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00928,2022-03-10-T-011,928,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Third, we will support these community volunteers in their projects through grants, cross-sharing of volunteering opportunities and also providing resources, together with other agencies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00929,2022-03-10-T-011,929,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The PA's efforts also complement ongoing SG Cares' efforts to expand the base of volunteers through working with community partners.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00930,2022-03-10-T-011,930,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, let me now touch on the prevalence of neighbourly disputes. Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Derrick Goh, Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Gan Thiam Poh all asked about our processes to deal with such disputes and how we can enhance the use of mediation."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00931,2022-03-10-T-011,931,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Members will be aware that in 2014, the Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF) was introduced. The framework was aimed at facilitating effective resolution of common neighbourly disputes to seek to foster a more harmonious living environment."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00932,2022-03-10-T-011,932,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"An interagency workgroup has been reviewing this framework. Mr Gerald Giam asked who was involved. MinLaw, MCCY, MND and MHA are involved in this review."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00933,2022-03-10-T-011,933,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I also mentioned in my MinLaw COS speech, our agencies are exploring a range of enhancements to the framework. These cover both upstream measures to promote prosocial norms and downstream measures to enhance our response to disputes, addressing situations where disputes would benefit from mediation and possibly dispute resolution at the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT)."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00934,2022-03-10-T-011,934,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, we recognise that some disagreements, such as neighbour-generated nuisances, noise, and local and neighbour disamenities may not always meet the threshold for intervention by Government agencies. Oftentimes, they are also best suited for mediation, which provides not just a quick, friendly, informal process to deal with, but also one which, as far as possible, preserves the existing relationship between the two neighbours – one that is amicable and conciliatory in nature."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00935,2022-03-10-T-011,935,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"However, at present, as some Members have pointed out, the mediation take-up rate remains low despite this being a proven effective means to resolve disputes. We are, therefore, considering three broad areas of enhancements to better manage such disagreements."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00936,2022-03-10-T-011,936,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, we will collaborate with residents to strengthen the spirit of neighbourliness and graciousness through shared norms."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00937,2022-03-10-T-011,937,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In her MND COS speech, my colleague, Senior Minister of State Sim Ann, spoke about forming a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) on Neighbourhood Noise. This panel will seek to build consensus through community norms that can be a useful guide for determining acceptable behaviours amongst neighbours and also serve as a useful reference point for agencies in advising residents to be considerate neighbours."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00938,2022-03-10-T-011,938,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, we are considering ways to improve our dispute resolution mechanisms, both in mediation and in the CDRT."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00939,2022-03-10-T-011,939,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For mediation, we intend to increase the take-up rate for mediation, both formal and informal. The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) has a high settlement rate – I mentioned this previously and I will mention it again. For every 10 cases that go before the CMC, 8.8 of them are resolved. That is a very high number. This shows that when parties avail themselves of this process, formal mediation is very effective and should be the preferred mechanism for resolving neighbourly tensions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00940,2022-03-10-T-011,940,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We are looking into increasing awareness on the benefits of mediation. The CMC has been using social media to promote its services and has also been reaching out to frontline officers to promote the benefits of mediation and the referral process. We are exploring more varied modes of mediation to increase accessibility, for example, doing online virtual mediation."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00941,2022-03-10-T-011,941,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Additionally, we are also studying the feasibility of mandating mediation in appropriate circumstances and in those cases, requiring disputing neighbours to undergo mediation before filing a claim with CDRT. This is so that neighbours may resolve differences amicably as far as possible, without first going through the CDRT process, which is adjudicatory and often zero-sum in nature."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00942,2022-03-10-T-011,942,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We are also considering possible consequences for parties who fail to attend mediation and, yet, want to pursue a claim at CDRT."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00943,2022-03-10-T-011,943,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Gerald Giam suggested that we allow adverse inferences to be drawn and we will consider that. We will also consider the other suggestions by Mr Gerald Giam, which were good suggestions, on how to effectively promote mediation in such situations."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00944,2022-03-10-T-011,944,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,We are also studying possible mechanisms for a CMC settlement agreement to be registered as an order of Court. This will then make it easier for the CMC to have its settlement agreements enforced as an order of Court.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00945,2022-03-10-T-011,945,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, beyond these, grassroots and other community leaders also play an important role in preserving positive neighbourly relations and often partner frontline agencies in resolving such disputes. We will work on programmes to better equip our community leaders with the skills to informally mediate between residents. Very often, they are also a neighbour themselves and can be the best first responder to the situation to understand the context, the lay of the land and, quite possibly, be the respected person that both neighbours can look up to. These are the ingredients for a successful mediation."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00946,2022-03-10-T-011,946,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Patrick Tay asked about the CDRT's caseload. In the past five years, 721 claims have been filed with CDRT, with 138 cases ordered to undergo mediation at CMC or CDRC, and 656 cases being disposed of by CDRT."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00947,2022-03-10-T-011,947,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We are studying process changes to alleviate the difficulties which some parties face in navigating the CDRT process and to ensure greater effectiveness of CDRT amongst the parties involved. These changes could include empowering CDRT to obtain expedited relief, akin to an interim injunction, in egregious cases and introducing measures to deter non-compliance with CDRT orders more effectively. In cases where respondents breach the orders granted by CDRT, claimants have gone on to apply for Special Directions, Compliance Bonds and Exclusion Orders from CDRT."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00948,2022-03-10-T-011,948,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Gerald Giam raised a point about uploading of evidence.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00949,2022-03-10-T-011,949,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The current requirement for audio and video recordings, which often are the most direct way in which you can show and substantiate your position to the CDRT, these are usually submitted using CD or DVD due to the need to preserve data integrity and security."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00950,2022-03-10-T-011,950,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Nonetheless, the Courts are continually reviewing their processes and will take into account Mr Giam's point and assess the viability of alternatives to submit evidence in Court. In the meantime, Court users who require assistance to submit audio or video recordings to the CDRT can approach the CDRT Registry for assistance."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00951,2022-03-10-T-011,951,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Third and, finally, we are looking to enhance processes and resources for a targeted response that can better assess the nature and scope of a complaint and attend to them quickly."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00952,2022-03-10-T-011,952,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,One possibility could be a team of ground responders empowered to collect and share evidence or reports with the CDRT to alleviate the evidential burden for parties involved. More details will be announced as we continue with this review and the findings are firmed up.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00953,2022-03-10-T-011,953,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, the various initiatives I have spoken about today signals our commitment to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic not just stronger, but also more cohesive and innovative as a society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00954,2022-03-10-T-011,954,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me round up my response this afternoon by returning to sports and our sportsmen and sportswomen, all of whom exemplify the values and qualities we all aspire to as a people."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00955,2022-03-10-T-011,955,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Darryl David asked for an update on TeamSG's preparations for the major games in 2022.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00956,2022-03-10-T-011,956,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me just recap 2021. We had a successful 2021.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00957,2022-03-10-T-011,957,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Last year, all of us cheered our Olympians and Paralympians as they flew the Singapore flag high and proud in Tokyo. We celebrated the achievements of Loh Kean Yew and Aloysius Yapp who reached the pinnacles of their respective sports last year, in badminton and in cue sports. Shayna Ng and Yip Pin Xiu, names which I am sure all of you recognise, continued to inspire us through world-class performances in bowling and swimming."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00958,2022-03-10-T-011,958,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our youth athletes did extremely well, too. Colin Soon won four Gold medals at the Asian Youth Para Games for swimming; Maximilian Maeder won the Under-19 World Championships for kite foiling; and Izaac Quek, who is competing at the World Table Tennis (WTT) Singapore Smash, won the Under-15 Singles title for table tennis."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00959,2022-03-10-T-011,959,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We will have a busy sporting calendar in 2022. We will have the Hanoi SEA Games in May, the Birmingham Commonwealth Games in July and August, the Hangzhou Asian Games and the Hangzhou Para Games in September and October, respectively."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00960,2022-03-10-T-011,960,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I am confident that our TeamSG athletes will continue to fly our flag high and inspire us with their resilience, fortitude and solidarity, the very same qualities that will enable Singapore to progress and develop on multiple fronts."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00961,2022-03-10-T-011,961,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I have spoken at length in Parliament earlier this year and last year on the Government's support for high performance sports and our TeamSG athletes. We will continue to do so and enable each of our athletes to put their best foot forward in these competitions. We encourage all to support our TeamSG athletes.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00962,2022-03-10-T-011,962,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mdm Chairman, our transition out of the pandemic will not be without bumps and hurdles. Much of the impact that COVID-19 has on the sectors we care for is intangible and often latent. They are hidden. We have to ensure that we do not suffer a deficit in social resilience in our society, even as we strive to protect lives and livelihoods in this pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00963,2022-03-10-T-011,963,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, sports, culture, heritage – they hold a mirror to our society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00964,2022-03-10-T-011,964,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"They show us who we are, how far we have come and what we cherish, value and aspire to. Resilience in defeat and grace in victory – these are qualities that are like a microcosm of our society. As our athletes and artists succeed, so does our nation."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00965,2022-03-10-T-011,965,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"More importantly, in sports, art, culture and heritage, we see that our diversity in race, colour and creed is, in fact, our strength. These distinctions do not divide us; they enable us, they make us stronger. Whether it is on the playing field or under the stage lights, our athletes and artists show us that what matters are what we bring to the table – our unique gifts, talents and experiences – and our shared dreams."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00966,2022-03-10-T-011,966,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The qualities we see on the stage or on the pitch – grace under pressure, commitment to excellence, dedication to one another, to our team mates – are the very same ones we hold dear in society, that inspire in us pride, unity and courage, and the ability to dream even bigger together. They speak to the heart of Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00967,2022-03-10-T-011,967,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On that note, Mdm Chairman, MCCY will ensure our arts, heritage and sports sectors will emerge from this pandemic stronger, better, faster and more vibrant, innovative and resilient. They will continue to inspire, unite and move us, as we continue to strengthen the heart of Singapore towards an even more caring, gracious and truly inclusive society. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00968,2022-03-10-T-011,968,,Minister of State Low Yen Ling.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00969,2022-03-10-T-011,969,Low Yen Ling,"Mdm Chairman, in the last two years, MCCY, the National Arts Council (NAC) and the National Heritage Board (NHB) have rolled out wide-ranging measures to safeguard livelihoods, build capabilities and position our arts and culture sector for a strong recovery in the new normal. Kudos to our arts and culture organisations and practitioners – they have responded boldly and creatively to the challenges brought on by the pandemic. Through their craft and artistic contributions, they have provided soothing balm and comfort to us all in a difficult time like this. We are grateful for their resilience and perseverance."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00970,2022-03-10-T-011,970,Low Yen Ling,"Looking ahead, for the year 2022, we will continue to work closely with our arts and culture community to chart our path towards recovery. We will enlarge our longer-term plans with the aims to foster in Singapore a resilient, sustainable and future-ready arts and culture ecosystem that  one, enriches and inspires lives; two, unites us as a nation, with pride in our shared heritage; and three, enhances Singapore's shine as a global city."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00971,2022-03-10-T-011,971,Low Yen Ling,"Today, we look forward to our arts and culture sector recovering even stronger than before from the pandemic. Our practitioners have reached new audiences, created new experiences and enhanced existing capabilities while developing new ones in areas like digital showcases. This is the result of our collective resolve over the last two years as the arts and culture community collaborate and support one another."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00972,2022-03-10-T-011,972,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Darryl David will be pleased to know that we will do even more to sustain the momentum and enable the sector to build on these gains. As shared earlier by Minister Edwin Tong, we will be injecting an additional $12 million to sustain good practices and learning points from COVID-19 after the end of the Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP). Let me elaborate."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00973,2022-03-10-T-011,973,Low Yen Ling,"As we continue to adapt and move towards a new normal, we will extend the Venue Hire Subsidy (VHS) for another three months from 1 April 2022 to 30 June 2022, at a stepped-down rate of 30%. This will continue to defray venue hire costs for our practitioners, as we progressively resume activities and welcome back larger audiences."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00974,2022-03-10-T-011,974,Low Yen Ling,"Introduced last year as part of the ACRP, the Organisation Transformation Grant (OTG) has attracted keen interest from arts and culture organisations and practitioners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00975,2022-03-10-T-011,975,Low Yen Ling,"To sustain support for transformation, NHB will incorporate the OTG into its existing grants, such as the Heritage Research Grant, as well as the Minor and Major Project Grant. Heritage businesses and organisations will be able to benefit from an increased grant amount of up to $40,000, from $30,000 previously, to cater to larger-scale and longer-term projects. The grants will also be open to Business Associations to encourage transformation efforts in our historic districts."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00976,2022-03-10-T-011,976,Low Yen Ling,"Similarly, NAC will launch a new Sector Transformation Fund (STF) to promote and sustain the transformation efforts of our arts and culture community. Projects previously supported under the ACRP OTG that have longer-term potential for further development, can tap on the STF to push ahead and transform."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00977,2022-03-10-T-011,977,Low Yen Ling,"Let me now share how we will boost the sustainability of the arts and culture sector for diverse communities to enjoy, a point passionately highlighted by Ms Janet Ang. We will empower the sector to leverage digital technologies to pursue new artistic, cultural and business opportunities. Through digitalisation, the sector can enhance their existing revenue streams, as well as improve productivity and organisational effectiveness."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00978,2022-03-10-T-011,978,Low Yen Ling,"We recently launched the Arts and Culture Digital Roadmap on 28 February to equip and enhance the digital journey of our arts and culture organisations and practitioners. They can use the Digital Roadmap, which has a self-assessment checklist, to gauge their level of digital readiness and learn about the range of digital solutions and funding schemes available to businesses, charities and individuals that can support such efforts."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00979,2022-03-10-T-011,979,Low Yen Ling,"As Mr Mark Chay pointed out, we can showcase our unique culture to local, as well as overseas audiences by using more digital content. For instance, Ding Yi Music Company brought their triennial international composition festival called ""Composium"" online last year, which led to its musicians and the compositions of local composers, such as Cultural Medallion recipients Eric Watson and Law Wai Lun, reaching international audiences. In the coming months, MCCY, NAC and NHB will be engaging our arts and culture organisations and practitioners through roadshows and workshops to promote awareness of the Digital Roadmap. We will also provide tailored support to those who require assistance to digitalise. Details of these efforts will be made available on the websites of all three organisations, once they are ready."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00980,2022-03-10-T-011,980,Low Yen Ling,"Madam, through the Self-Employed Person Grant (SEPG) introduced under the ACRP, Self-employed Persons (SEPs) have engaged in new collaborations. For instance, an independent producer, Ms Nurhafezhah Maznan, created a structured programme for eight young theatre directors to learn from 17 artists and other creatives on how to direct works in Malay and Tamil."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00981,2022-03-10-T-011,981,Low Yen Ling,"We will continue to deepen our support for SEPs by incorporating the SEPG into NAC's existing Presentation and Participation (P&P) and Capability Development (CD) grants. Ms Tin Pei Ling will be glad to know that, through this move, priority will be given to grant applications initiated by or targeted at SEPs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00982,2022-03-10-T-011,982,Low Yen Ling,"In addition, we are committed to creating conditions in the arts and culture sector for livelihoods to thrive, with targeted support for SEPs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00983,2022-03-10-T-011,983,Low Yen Ling,"First, we will increase opportunities for capacity development for SEPs. To this end, NAC will raise greater awareness of the skills and competencies that our SEPs need to help them make informed choices for their career progression. NAC will also work with partners to mount training courses in new and emerging areas, such as e-pedagogy and digital arts education programme development, for arts instructors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00984,2022-03-10-T-011,984,Low Yen Ling,"Second, NAC will work with industry partners to ensure better protection and working conditions for our SEPs. NAC will promote the adoption of best practices amongst organisations which engage SEPs – from the signing of formal contracts to improving contractual obligations between the parties and recognising our SEPs for their skills and contributions. For example, our national cultural institutions have adopted the Tripartite Standards on Contracting with SEPs since 2018."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00985,2022-03-10-T-011,985,Low Yen Ling,"Third, NAC will pilot new ways for SEPs to create value in the arts sector and beyond. NAC has observed some enterprising SEPs, especially in the last two years, developing artist-business partnership and testing new ways to work with enterprises working on sustainability solutions. NAC will support SEPs to push boundaries and contribute to the broader creative economy, as well as to collaborate with one another and new partners – such as local businesses – from other sectors in new and innovative ways."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00986,2022-03-10-T-011,986,Low Yen Ling,"We encourage our SEPs to make full use of the available grants to sustain their practices, collaborate on new initiatives and develop new capabilities. We look forward to our SEPs' continued contribution to Singapore's arts and culture."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00987,2022-03-10-T-011,987,Low Yen Ling,"Madam, besides developing our people, MCCY is also working closely with the sector to strengthen our cultural infrastructure for artists and creatives to incubate, to experiment and to collaborate."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00988,2022-03-10-T-011,988,Low Yen Ling,"One of the newest additions to this growing pool is the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) at Tanjong Pagar Distripark (TPD). I visited SAM at TPD just two months ago with Minister Edwin Tong in January for the 10th edition of the Singapore Art Week (SAW) 2022 and we saw for ourselves how a former industrial warehouse was turned into a fascinating location for experimental exhibitions and programmes. The TPD welcomed more than 17,000 visitors during SAW 2022 and its unique large space allowed the public to be immersed in various arts and culture experiences in a very engaging manner."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00989,2022-03-10-T-011,989,Low Yen Ling,Another exciting development is also taking place at Kampong Java. NAC is partnering the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to refurbish and pilot arts and culture sandbox spaces at 52 to 56 Kampong Java. These venues that I have mentioned will offer our artists of various disciplines an affordable space to focus on their experimental and creative process. NAC will seek views from the arts community on the use of these spaces in the first half of this year.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00990,2022-03-10-T-011,990,Low Yen Ling,"Madam, many of these cultural spaces are located at sites with a long history. Our built heritage connects us to the nation's past, like what Mr Sitoh Yih Pin mentioned, and forms a part of our cultural identity. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin will be glad to know that MCCY is continuing to safeguard and celebrate Singapore's shared heritage. One important aspect of this work involves the heritage impact assessment (HIA) framework, which Minister for National Development Mr Desmond Lee had shared earlier at MND's COS. MCCY and NHB will continue to support MND and URA in implementing the HIA framework. The framework further strengthens how public agencies must thoroughly evaluate the heritage significance of a site as an important consideration in the early stage of planning for development projects."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00991,2022-03-10-T-011,991,Low Yen Ling,Our rich heritage is also a source of national pride. All Singaporeans celebrated when our hawker culture was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in December 2020.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00992,2022-03-10-T-011,992,Low Yen Ling,"Last year, at the COS, I shared that we would embark on consultations to identify possible elements for Singapore's second UNESCO intangible cultural heritage nomination. Between June 2021 and January 2022, NHB held Focus Group Discussions with approximately 170 participants, comprising intangible cultural heritage practitioners, heritage business owners, academics and youths, to hear their views and their thoughts and suggestions. Through these conversations, we heard a clear preference for our second nomination to be multicultural in nature and relatable to Singaporeans. A total of 10 possible elements have been suggested through these consultations. For example, our Chingay Parade, the Making and Sharing of Kueh, Peranakan Beadwork and Embroidery, Orchid Cultivation and Yusheng, just to name a few. NHB will broaden its consultations over the course of the coming months to engage more stakeholders, as well as the general public, before a final decision is made on the element to be nominated."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00993,2022-03-10-T-011,993,Low Yen Ling,"Mdm Chairman, our museums showcase our valuable heritage and I am glad to update that, come this December, families and young children can look forward to a dynamic and engaging experience at the new Children's Museum Singapore (CMSG), in what used to be the Singapore Philatelic Museum."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00994,2022-03-10-T-011,994,Low Yen Ling,"Ms Janet Ang spoke passionately about the importance of arts and culture for the young, and we agree with her. The CMSG will feature a range of topics, including Singapore's history and biodiversity, and help foster a stronger awareness of our shared values and national identity in our young children."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00995,2022-03-10-T-011,995,Low Yen Ling,"In another development, following extensive consultations with the community, the Peranakan Museum will reopen in 2023, with an expanded curatorial focus on the rich cross-cultural traditions and distinctive arts of the Peranakan communities in Southeast Asia."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00996,2022-03-10-T-011,996,Low Yen Ling,"Besides looking forward to the CMSG and Peranakan Museum, Singaporeans can all play a part in shaping an important reflection of our heritage – the Founders' Memorial. Next month, NHB will launch the Founders' Memorial ""Share Your Story, Shape Our Memorial"" Travelling Exhibition. Besides an update on the Memorial's architectural design, the travelling exhibition will provide the public a chance to share artefacts and stories related to key national policies or milestones, or their encounters with our founding leaders."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00997,2022-03-10-T-011,997,Low Yen Ling,"For example, Mr Timothy de Souza is keen to share his personal mementoes as one of Singapore's first fighter pilots. We look forward to rich and interesting contributions from all Singaporeans."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00998,2022-03-10-T-011,998,Low Yen Ling,"Madam, looking ahead, MCCY will build upon the foundation and progress made by Our SG Arts Plan in 2018. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin would be glad to know that, today, our arts sector includes diverse talents who collaborate and create new arts experiences for audiences in Singapore and beyond, including the under-reached groups mentioned by Ms Janet Ang and Mr Mark Chay. Through signature arts festival platforms, such as SAW, which I mentioned earlier, Singapore International Festival of Arts and the Singapore Writers Festival, we have brought together diverse players in the local arts ecosystem, grown a strong audience base and profiled Singapore arts globally."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-00999,2022-03-10-T-011,999,Low Yen Ling,"Community partnerships have been forged across 20 Arts and Culture nodes, bringing people of different backgrounds together through the arts."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01000,2022-03-10-T-011,1000,Low Yen Ling,"Arts education has also been enhanced with experiential, cohort-based learning programmes to museums and concert halls, as well as digital content. Arts offerings are more inclusive than before, with support for quality arts experiences for our preschoolers, as well as students with special needs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01001,2022-03-10-T-011,1001,Low Yen Ling,"Since July 2021, NAC has held conversations with around 400 stakeholders in one-on-one interviews and also focus group discussions on the future of the arts for Singapore. Building on these insights, we are developing Our SG Arts Plan 2.0 to set the stage for the next phase of our arts development."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01002,2022-03-10-T-011,1002,Low Yen Ling,"First, we will strengthen the role of the arts in the wider local and global creative economy; second, we will develop further ways for the arts to contribute to deepening our national identity, social cohesion and inclusivity; third, make the arts a distinctive factor that adds to Singapore's attractiveness as a global city."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01003,2022-03-10-T-011,1003,Low Yen Ling,NAC welcomes feedback and ideas from the sector to refine Our SG Arts Plan 2.0. A public consultation will be conducted in the second part of this year.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01004,2022-03-10-T-011,1004,Low Yen Ling,"Let me now turn to Our SG Heritage Plan which has, since 2018, enabled Singaporeans to rediscover and affirm our shared values and identity through diverse offerings and multiple touchpoints. Our museums are now more accessible through digital initiatives and offerings that reach out to a larger audience. Seniors can now enjoy age-friendly programmes under the Silver Hubs initiative, while programmes under HeritageCares also reach out to lower-income families, persons with disabilities, children with special needs as well as youths-at-risk."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01005,2022-03-10-T-011,1005,Low Yen Ling,"Heritage is being infused into everyday spaces around us through the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme. Our Tampines Gallery, Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery and Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery have all enlivened local communities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01006,2022-03-10-T-011,1006,Low Yen Ling,"Following NHB's consultations with a diverse range of stakeholders that include insights from our museum community, youth, creatives, heritage societies and heritage business owners, NHB is drawing up plans for Our SG Heritage Plan 2.0."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01007,2022-03-10-T-011,1007,Low Yen Ling,"Firstly, we will support the heritage sector's digital adoption and develop capabilities to transform their operations and efforts in connecting Singaporeans to our heritage; second, we will also showcase Singapore's rich multicultural heritage beyond our shores to grow new audiences and markets for our heritage sector, while, at the same time, learning from the best in the world to develop our home talents; thirdly, we will work closely with our local communities as well as heritage enthusiasts and partners in the tech and creative industries to celebrate our unique local histories."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01008,2022-03-10-T-011,1008,Low Yen Ling,"We invite all Singaporeans to share your views and feedback for Our SG Heritage Plan 2.0 when NHB launches the public call in the middle of this year. Mdm Chairman, in Mandarin, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01009,2022-03-10-T-011,1009,Low Yen Ling,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Developing our local arts and heritage sectors enhances Singapore's vibrancy and attractiveness as a global city. Further, art pieces and heritage assets that resonate with Singaporeans will also strengthen our sense of belonging and help build a more cohesive and inclusive society. MCCY will strive to achieve these goals by continuing with our SG Arts and Heritage Plans."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01010,2022-03-10-T-011,1010,Low Yen Ling,"Since the launch of Our SG Arts Plan in 2018, we have profiled Singapore arts through signature arts platforms, forged community partnerships and brought arts across 20 arts and cultural nodes. This strengthens community involvement, including preschoolers, students with special needs and the elderly, ensuring that our arts scene becomes more inclusive and benefits more people."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01011,2022-03-10-T-011,1011,Low Yen Ling,"On the other hand, Our SG Heritage Plan, which was launched in 2018, has also allowed Singaporeans to rediscover and affirm their shared heritage. Preservation of more national monuments and the successful inscription of our hawker culture on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage have also engendered greater public recognition of the value of heritage in our everyday lives."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01012,2022-03-10-T-011,1012,Low Yen Ling,"As the next step, NAC and NHB will broaden their consultations this year and continue their conversations with Singaporeans and partners from various fields as we co-create the next editions of Our SG Arts and Heritage Plans, so as to contribute to the creative economy and safeguard and promote Singapore's multicultural heritage."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01013,2022-03-10-T-011,1013,Low Yen Ling,"(In English)  Mdm Chairman, MCCY and our agencies remain committed to working with the arts and culture community to revitalise our arts and culture sector and chart its future directions. As we build on the gains that we have made together over the past two years, we will carve an exciting journey ahead towards a thriving and sustainable arts and culture ecosystem – one that enriches livelihoods, unites our people and enlivens our city. [Applause.]"

2022-03-10-T-011-S-01023,2022-03-10-T-011,1023,Darryl David,"Chairman, many of us remember fondly the Kallang Roar, although I agree with Minister Edwin Tong when he said earlier that while it is great to revel in nostalgia, we should also look forward to the future of the bright talents that we have coming up through the Singapore football pipeline."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01024,2022-03-10-T-011,1024,Darryl David,"Last year, MCCY announced its strategic plan to revitalise our football ecosystem and improve the standards of football at all levels through its Unleash the Roar project, which of course, was mooted to bring back that Kallang Roar. The project relates to the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) goal for the national team to qualify for the 2034 FIFA World Cup – a noble and aspirational goal, indeed. The project is a worthy one as it helps our youths undertake intensive and structured high-quality football training to play football professionally."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01025,2022-03-10-T-011,1025,Darryl David,"Can MCCY provide an update on the progress of the Unleash the Roar project and its vision to unite Singaporeans of all ages, races and gender through football?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01026,2022-03-10-T-011,1026,Abdul Samad,"Chairman, soccer has always been a sport that unites our community since our national team participated in Malaysia Cup. Aside from the Malaysia Cup matches back then, we used to host competitive international friendly tournaments, such as the Merlion Cup, which attracts participation from renowned international teams like South Korea and Saudi Arabia."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01027,2022-03-10-T-011,1027,Abdul Samad,"At the last AFF Suzuki Cup between Singapore and Indonesia, where I was extremely fortunate to be physically inside the stadium with my family members and friends, we witnessed not just a match but a strong Singapore fighting spirit from our players, coupled with a multiracial crowd of all ages cheering the team on. The crowd support for the team on that night was one of passion and certainly brings back memories of the past glory days. In fact, the closure for that was when the crowd stood up and sang our national anthem to show appreciation for the players. They may have lost the match, but they have certainly reignited the spirit of the Kallang Roar."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01028,2022-03-10-T-011,1028,Abdul Samad,"Chairman, the last time our local soccer created a large interest in soccer was when we won the Malaysia Cup in 2015, even if the mood was less happening compared to 1994 when we won the Malaysian Cup League and Cup double. Sadly, after every success in the Malaysia Cup for the last two occasions, we exited – either we exit by choice or Malaysia asked us to exit."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01029,2022-03-10-T-011,1029,Abdul Samad,"I would like to appeal to MCCY and FAS to analyse and review on how we can bring back such moods in our local soccer to where it was at one time. How can we have more support for our local S League team, just like Lion City Sailors? I would also call on big organisations to play a pivotal role by being the main sponsor for all the S League clubs. Only with good sponsorships can clubs bring in quality foreign players that complement our local players for more entertaining games that can also improve our local soccer standards."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01030,2022-03-10-T-011,1030,Abdul Samad,"Singapore must develop more players with calibre of not just Quah Kim Song, but also like Harriss Harun, Faris Ramli, Jacob Mahler and Shahdan Sulaiman, for the future of our local soccer team that is not just of talent, but inclusive of all races that reflect Singapore as a multiracial society. We hope, by doing this, we do not just bring back the Kallang Roar, but we can even uplift the roar beyond Kallang and the Sports Hub!"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01031,2022-03-10-T-011,1031,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, in December last year, our Singapore Lions men's football team put up a brave fight, in the semi-final of the AFF Suzuki Cup. Although they were down to eight men, they put up a proud fight until the final whistle and could hold their heads up high despite the defeat. The team's run in the tournament sparked a reinvigoration in local sentiments about our footballing scene."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01032,2022-03-10-T-011,1032,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Twelve years ago, another team bearing Singapore colours sparked the imagination of local football fans – the Singapore Youth Olympic Games (YOG) football team. The players from that tournament were dubbed a ""Golden Generation"" not only for achieving a milestone bronze medal at the inaugural event, but also for their exciting style of play. And yet, a review of their fortunes a decade later told a story of a lost generation of footballers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01033,2022-03-10-T-011,1033,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"While it is true that youth footballing success is no guarantee of future achievement, we must also be mindful of other factors, such as failures in the training and development systems and the lack of quality in mentoring, coaching and grooming of young talents. Sir, it is my hope that those involved in the ""Unleash the Roar"" (UTR) project announced in March 2021 bear in mind the lessons learnt from the past and continually engage stakeholders, such as coaches, club management, fans, but, most of all – the players."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01034,2022-03-10-T-011,1034,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Just over the weekend, a feature on CNA asked the question, ""What does Singapore football need to raise its game?"" The feature struck a cautious, yet, optimistic note for the future of Singapore football. I welcome the small steps that have been taken under the UTR project, such as the setting up of School Football Academies and partnerships with global leaders in football, such as clubs from the Spanish premier La Liga."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01035,2022-03-10-T-011,1035,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"However, it is disappointing that following the resignation of Mr Tatsuma Yoshida after the Suzuki Cup tournament, a replacement has yet to be announced. Sir, we must move fast or be left behind."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01036,2022-03-10-T-011,1036,,"Mr Mark Chay, please take your two cuts together."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01037,2022-03-10-T-011,1037,Mark Chay,"Chairman, I would like to raise three points for MCCY to consider."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01038,2022-03-10-T-011,1038,Mark Chay,"One, additional funds for national teams. As Team Singapore takes the stage multiple times this year, I would like to ask for additional funds to be allocated to enable our Team Singapore athletes a fair shot at preparing, qualifying and competing at these major international competitions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01039,2022-03-10-T-011,1039,Mark Chay,"Two, additional resources to build our capabilities for sport science and administration. I would like to ask if there are sufficient sports science resources and personnel to support our athletes. If not, what is the plan to ramp up in time for the games?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01040,2022-03-10-T-011,1040,Mark Chay,"Three, greater support for Team Singapore athletes serving their National Service."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01041,2022-03-10-T-011,1041,Mark Chay,"Many of our Team Singapore athletes are National Servicemen. I would, therefore, like to ask if provisions have been made to enable and support our National Servicemen who have qualified for the games, for instance, allowing them time out to train and compete."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01042,2022-03-10-T-011,1042,Mark Chay,"At the outset, I would like to declare the I am a coach with the Singapore Disability Sports Council. I would like to raise three points in this regard. I will first speak on empowering coaches with the requisite knowledge and skills."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01043,2022-03-10-T-011,1043,Mark Chay,"As Singapore moves to be more inclusive in the sporting arena, it becomes all the more timely to ensure that coaches are equipped with the necessary skills to handle differently-abled athletes. I would like to suggest CoachSG work together with the Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) to develop and run courses. On coaching education in the broader sense, I am happy to note that CoachSG is working with experts at Leeds Beckett University to develop a coaching competency framework that would impact and shape our coaching development and education pathway in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01044,2022-03-10-T-011,1044,Mark Chay,"I would like to ask how this study will manifest in the CoachSG courses, and, just as importantly, how the study and the competency framework would result in greater recognition of coaches and their true value proposition, in terms of remuneration."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01045,2022-03-10-T-011,1045,Mark Chay,"Chairman, I will move to my second point – recognising coaches and their accomplishments."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01046,2022-03-10-T-011,1046,Mark Chay,"In my Budget 2022 Debate speech, I listed five Singaporean athletes who have emerged on top of the world in their respective disciplines. Can we name all their coaches who helped them achieve this feat? Do we know that these coaches were all local Singaporeans? And when was the last time we recognised a coach for a National Day Award?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01047,2022-03-10-T-011,1047,Mark Chay,"The achievements of coaches have not enjoyed the same level of recognition as our national athletes do, and this should not be the case. They are with our athletes every step of the way, and these coaches not only ensure the physical performance of our athletes, they also play important roles in developing the athletes in imparting values and ethics."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01048,2022-03-10-T-011,1048,Mark Chay,"I would, therefore, reason that their jobs are as important and deserving of recognition as those teachers at our MOE schools. I would like to propose that coaches be recognised for their contributions to inspire more Singaporeans to take on the mantle of coach and groom generations of world champions to come."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01049,2022-03-10-T-011,1049,Mark Chay,I now move to my final point – improving coaching standards and regulations.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01050,2022-03-10-T-011,1050,Mark Chay,"If we were to celebrate our coaches, we should also consider strengthening the regulatory framework which governs coaches, and sports for that matter. The SafeSport Unified Code was launched last year and this was a huge step forward in ensuring the safety of our participants in sports. However, there is a lacuna in its ambit. It only affects NROC-registered coaches. What happens if the alleged offender is, for instance, an unregistered coach, a team manager or a volunteer?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01051,2022-03-10-T-011,1051,Mark Chay,"To plug this gap, I have two suggestions for the Ministry. One, develop a framework for licensing and compulsory registration for all sports coaches and instructors; and two, extend the registration to administrators and volunteers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01052,2022-03-10-T-011,1052,Mark Chay,"I believe these measures would ensure a consistent standard and accountability for all persons who undertake the coaching role, which will then form a sturdy foundation for the sports scene in Singapore to thrive."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01053,2022-03-10-T-011,1053,Koh Lian Pin,"Chairman, at first glance, sports and sustainability may seem to be two very different arenas. However, there may be opportunities for collaboration between the two sectors and communities for mutual benefit and the benefit of all Singaporeans. For example, in July last year, ActiveSG launched the permanent programme to collect and recycle used sports shoes into construction material for jogging tracks and fitness corners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01054,2022-03-10-T-011,1054,Koh Lian Pin,Could the Ministry share what additional initiatives are being considered to promote sustainability in sports?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01055,2022-03-10-T-011,1055,,"Mr Xie Yao Quan, you may take your two cuts together."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01056,2022-03-10-T-011,1056,Xie Yao Quan,"Chairman, I would like to speak briefly about sports today – the role of sports in our lives and in our community. And I would like to start by recalling Minister Edwin Tong's response to one of my Parliamentary Questions recently."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01057,2022-03-10-T-011,1057,Xie Yao Quan,"In his response, the Minister laid out very comprehensively the overall framework – of our sporting system, sporting programmes and sporting infrastructure – and at various levels, from sports in the community, to sporting performance at the highest level. And his response reminded me then that sports are a little bit like clean air in our lives; we tend to forget that it is there, until it is no longer there."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01058,2022-03-10-T-011,1058,Xie Yao Quan,"But I think, through years of effort, we have built up a framework that has allowed sports to become so integral a part of our lives and our community here in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01059,2022-03-10-T-011,1059,Xie Yao Quan,"It is in this spirit that I raise two questions, around what more we can do to strengthen the role of sports in our lives and our community."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01060,2022-03-10-T-011,1060,Xie Yao Quan,"First, on inclusive sports. Sports have the power to uplift and empower individuals. It uplifts the spirit, it allows for the display and expression of talent and flair, it can help a person discover himself or herself. By extension, sports have the power to uplift and empower whole segments in society – more vulnerable children, youths at risk, persons with disabilities, seniors. It can transform lives."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01061,2022-03-10-T-011,1061,Xie Yao Quan,"The Delta League by the Home Team is a good example. And SportSG has also launched the SportCares programme. So, can MCCY share its future plans on its SportCares programme, so that we can continue to grow a movement of inclusive sports to transform lives in Singapore?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01062,2022-03-10-T-011,1062,Xie Yao Quan,"Chairman, second, on high-performance sports. As Singaporeans, we cheer our national athletes on when they compete, we celebrate with them when they win and partake in their disappointment when they do not."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01063,2022-03-10-T-011,1063,Xie Yao Quan,"But, I think, we will reach the next level in our high-performance sporting culture here in Singapore when we can go beyond spectatorship, transcend spectatorship, to be an active part of the system and an active part of the movement."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01064,2022-03-10-T-011,1064,Xie Yao Quan,"In this respect, MCCY has created a One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF), where individuals and corporates can make donations with dollar-for-dollar matching by the Government."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01065,2022-03-10-T-011,1065,Xie Yao Quan,"Can MCCY share its future plans for this Fund, so that we can continue to encourage a spirit of giving towards high-performance sports in Singapore?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01066,2022-03-10-T-011,1066,,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam, you can take your two cuts together."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01067,2022-03-10-T-011,1067,Rahayu Mahzam,"In 2021, our para-athletes shone on the world stage. For the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, Team Singapore fielded 10 athletes across six sports to compete with the world's best and represent Singapore at the highest sporting showcase. In October last year, this House resolved in a Motion to congratulate Team Singapore Olympians and Paralympians for their achievements. For the Bahrain Asian Youth Para Games, Singapore sent 13 athletes and the amazing team made the nation proud by bringing back five gold, three silver and two bronze medals."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01068,2022-03-10-T-011,1068,Rahayu Mahzam,"Our para-athletes have been an inspiration to us all. They show us what it means to defy the odds and what is possible when you are not defined or constrained by physical limitations. We can, and should, draw from their example to encourage more participation in sports in Singapore, especially among persons with disabilities (PWDs)."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01069,2022-03-10-T-011,1069,Rahayu Mahzam,"I am happy to hear about the Para Sport Academy but beyond the high-performance sporting participation, we should look at how we can facilitate regular participation in sports activities by improving access and creating more opportunities for PWDs to be involved. There are many good reasons for this."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01070,2022-03-10-T-011,1070,Rahayu Mahzam,"For one, sports activities are a good way to keep healthy. We heard yesterday at the MOH COS debate about preventive health, and physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Sports activities not only help with physical wellness, but also mental well-being as participants interact with others and build relationships through their interactions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01071,2022-03-10-T-011,1071,Rahayu Mahzam,"Secondly, sports can be so empowering for PWDs. With facilitation and proper guidance, PWDs can acquire useful social skills and build up their confidence as they participate in sports activities that they enjoy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01072,2022-03-10-T-011,1072,Rahayu Mahzam,"Thirdly, there is so much potential to promote inclusiveness through sports. Sports are a social leveller that does not distinguish between educational levels, socio-economic status, race or religion. It helps bring together people from all walks of life. We can support and cheer for one another and use common facilities together. This would help normalise different abilities and open doors to a better appreciation and understanding of differences."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01073,2022-03-10-T-011,1073,Rahayu Mahzam,"I note that there have been efforts on this front. There is a Disability Sports Master Plan in place setting the roadmap for various initiatives. There are inclusive gyms and several disability sports programmes and also efforts by SportSG. I also understand that various stakeholders like Singapore Disability Sports Council and MOE, work with SportSG to enable talent development in disability sports and strengthen capabilities in the ecosystem."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01074,2022-03-10-T-011,1074,Rahayu Mahzam,I would like to understand if we have been tracking our progress. Have there been developments on inclusive physical exercise and disability sports programmes? Are knowledge and expertise in tailoring sports activities for PWDs and organising inclusive sports programmes sufficiently widespread?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01075,2022-03-10-T-011,1075,Rahayu Mahzam,I hope the Ministry can share its plans to leverage sports to make Singapore a more inclusive society.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01076,2022-03-10-T-011,1076,Rahayu Mahzam,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about much disruption and challenges to all, including our youths. Our young people had to contend with significant changes in their educational journey and there was a particularly specific impact for those who were in certain courses of study or at the tail end of their formal education. They had to quickly adjust to learning online, with less interaction with teachers and other students. It was especially challenging for those in technical courses where hands-on learning is important. Internship programmes had to be adjusted as firms implemented work-from-home arrangements. Those who had planned to study overseas or go for an exchange programme had their plans disrupted. Prospects for some industries appeared bleak as the economy pivoted and some wondered about their choice of study and career prospects."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01077,2022-03-10-T-011,1077,Rahayu Mahzam,"This caused much anxiety and uncertainty. Some young people I spoke to expressed how the pandemic has robbed them of their opportunities and youth. The impact on their mental well-being was, indeed, significant."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01078,2022-03-10-T-011,1078,Rahayu Mahzam,"According to the NYC Youth Statistics in Brief 2020, the youth labour force participation rates for the year 2019 was 61% for ages 20 to 24; 90.1% for ages 25 to 29; 92.3% for ages 30 to 34. According to the MOM report in June 2021, the youth unemployment rate climbed in 2020. Annual average resident youth unemployment rate hit 10.6%, 1.8% higher than during the 2009 global financial crisis and 1.3% higher than during the 2003 SARS pandemic."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01079,2022-03-10-T-011,1079,Rahayu Mahzam,"While the situation is challenging for those transiting from school to work, I feel that our youths have shown a lot of resilience in overcoming their situation. There may be industries affected, but there are many opportunities and new growth areas. It is important, therefore, to strategically look at how we can support our youths to seize the opportunities and provide them with the relevant insights, so that they are motivated and have the necessary information to make decisions for their future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01080,2022-03-10-T-011,1080,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mentors, especially in growth sectors, can play a meaningful role in this effort. I am a strong believer in mentoring. I support the efforts of Mentoring Alliance Singapore and oversee the youth empowerment and mentoring programmes under M3. I do not think I need to extol the virtues of mentoring to this House. We all know the value of having that someone in your life to give guidance and motivation as you venture into new unknown and challenging areas."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01081,2022-03-10-T-011,1081,Rahayu Mahzam,"I would like though to emphasise the importance of mentoring in opening world views and nudging young people to explore possibilities. This is especially significant for families of certain economic status, where their children do not benefit from the social capital of those who are more well-to-do or well-connected. Their world view may be circumscribed by what they see their parents do. Even if they get inspired by someone they read or hear about in the news, they do not know how to get there, how to achieve the same things. Given the current evolution of the economy post-pandemic, it is timely, in fact, more urgent now, to train people from various growing industries to become mentors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01082,2022-03-10-T-011,1082,Rahayu Mahzam,"Further, not everyone is as fortunate to meet a mentor who can guide her along. We need to make sure that every young person has access to the support she needs. There are a lot more programmes and opportunities now, compared to the time when I was in school. We could continue to improve on this by creating an ecosystem and culture of mentoring in Singapore. That way, every young person will have access to mentors and, when they grow older, may be mentors themselves."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01083,2022-03-10-T-011,1083,Rahayu Mahzam,"Aside from educational development and career prospects, it is important to also look into the emotional development and resilience of youths. There is a lot of awareness now about mental well-being and its impact on the holistic development of an individual. We should garner the insights and build that in as part of the training of mentors or mentoring programmes."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01084,2022-03-10-T-011,1084,Rahayu Mahzam,"I, therefore, hope that MCCY can look at efforts to develop a more strategic and current mentoring framework for our youths. I believe with these efforts, we can continue to encourage our youths to be resilient and hopeful for the future."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01085,2022-03-10-T-011,1085,,"Ms Hany Soh, you can take both cuts, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01086,2022-03-10-T-011,1086,Hany Soh,"Chairman, as part of the Government's overall efforts to secure a sustainable future for Singapore, can MCCY elaborate on its plans to ensure a greener and more sustainable sports ecosystem?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01087,2022-03-10-T-011,1087,Hany Soh,"In my previous green, sustainability-related Parliamentary speeches, I have shared my firm belief that community involvement plays a vital role in our overall nation's efforts towards SG Green Plan 2030 through our collective efforts and embracing an eco-friendly lifestyle and greenify the environment. In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set up the right hardware and co-create the green software."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01088,2022-03-10-T-011,1088,Hany Soh,"Active SG Woodlands Sports Centre situated in our Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC is one such example. A community farm was actually set up right next to its swimming pool and is being cared for by a team of passionate Team Nila Volunteers, as well as members of the public living around the vicinity of Marsiling and Woodgrove."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01089,2022-03-10-T-011,1089,Hany Soh,"The ground-up recycling effort at this community farm is commendable. Most of the fittings there are actually recycled items contributed and creatively put together by residents and ActiveSG staff. They have also exhibited their innovativeness by harvesting rainwater to irrigate the greens. These green farming activities not only keep the members active and fit but also build a strong kampong spirit as they routinely contribute the harvest to the vulnerable groups in our community, along with sharing their green tips to other community gardens within the neighbourhood."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01090,2022-03-10-T-011,1090,Hany Soh,"Are there any other plans for Sport SG to roll out similar green concepts to other sports centres across Singapore? How else does MCCY intend to involve the sports community, Singaporeans and partners from the private sectors to co-create solutions for sustainability and play a part in these efforts?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01091,2022-03-10-T-011,1091,Hany Soh,Minister Edwin Tong has previously shared his views that our young people are a crucial segment of our society. The youths of today are the leaders of tomorrow. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister. Our youths are the people who must have a say in the kind of society they want to be in and should play an active role in shaping Singapore's future.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01092,2022-03-10-T-011,1092,Hany Soh,"Youths today, however, faced many uncertainties, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic and other global issues. Many of them are also in transition through different life stages. These have placed a significant amount of stress on our young people, especially in areas, such as job prospects, finances and mental well-being. Despite these challenges, we have witnessed many of them tirelessly volunteering their time and effort in serving the vulnerable groups in our community during this eventful period."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01093,2022-03-10-T-011,1093,Hany Soh,"I am particularly grateful to the youths in our Woodgrove community. Despite facing their own challenges, they have organised mental wellness talks to motivate others to stay positive, distributed ""Return to School"" care packs to low-income group children, hosted upcycling ""Go Green"" workshops and planned many clean-up estate initiatives to raise empathy for our cleaners."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01094,2022-03-10-T-011,1094,Hany Soh,"Can MCCY share what is done to support youths' concerns and needs in their key priority areas? How does the whole Government intend to work together to support youths in navigating their various life stages and transitions? What has also been done to provide opportunities and support to our youths of different cultures and backgrounds to continue contributing to the community and mold the future of our Singapore, despite the present challenges that each of them may be facing now?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01095,2022-03-10-T-011,1095,,Ms Tin Pei Ling.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01096,2022-03-10-T-011,1096,Tin Pei Ling,"Chairman, a young resident of mine, only 23 years old, committed suicide in June last year. He was a good boy who was always giving, always there to support his peers, to counsel and encourage them to not take their lives. But he himself struggled."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01097,2022-03-10-T-011,1097,Tin Pei Ling,"He studied in an Arts school and did not take a conventional path. His graduation coincided with the pandemic. His enlistment was affected as the date for enlistment was unclear back then; he could not plan his life and did not know what he could do. He applied for jobs, but could not secure any, partly due to his specialisation and partly due to the uncertainty of when he had to start serving NS. The future felt bleak to him. Finally, he jumped from the block. I saw him not too long before he took his life, as I had only just given out an Edusave award to his sibling. I was at his wake, saw his mother and spoke with his friends who all missed him very dearly. It was absolutely heartbreaking. Imagine the pain the mummy was feeling."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01098,2022-03-10-T-011,1098,Tin Pei Ling,"So, youths today face many uncertainties and pressures – ranging from body image to grades, to relationships and to whether they have a future. These are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many youths are also in transition through different life stages. Arguably, if even adults having a few hard knocks in life already struggle when hit with a crisis, what more for youths?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01099,2022-03-10-T-011,1099,Tin Pei Ling,"Mental well-being has now come to the fore. It used to be a topic brushed away and shunned by many. I spoke on this for years in Parliament and when I was an undergraduate. People hardly wanted to talk about it. But now, we are forced to come face-to-face with it as we endure the pandemic but, thankfully, there is now a general public will to address it."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01100,2022-03-10-T-011,1100,Tin Pei Ling,"I know stress is not something one can legislate away. But the Government can direct resources through the right channels in a timely manner to help our youths through difficult times, to help build their resilience. Some of the stress could be mitigated by guiding them in the right direction, such as proactive career counselling and matching, and timely intervention to stop physical or online bullying. But, often times, it is also about letting them know that they are not alone, that there is someone or groups of people whom they can turn to for a listening ear, for positive affirmation, for advice and to nudge them to embrace a growth mindset. That someone may not always be a family member and that is okay. The school and community must be ready. And we must also be mindful to avoid coming across as patronising, but are sincere in wanting to help."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01101,2022-03-10-T-011,1101,Tin Pei Ling,"So, I would like to ask how is the Government supporting our youths in overcoming the challenges they face and achieving their aspirations? Our youths are our future. They must not feel hopeless and helpless. How will the whole-of-Government, therefore, work together to be present in their lives, to give and show support to our youths as they transition from one stage to the next?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01102,2022-03-10-T-011,1102,,Minister of State Alvin Tan.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01103,2022-03-10-T-011,1103,Alvin Tan,"Mr Chairman, Minister Edwin Tong spoke about our transition out of the pandemic – to build towards a strong, caring and inclusive Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01104,2022-03-10-T-011,1104,Alvin Tan,"Our national monuments embody our foundational values and where we come from. Elgin Bridge, located just next to this House, is one of them. It quietly symbolises our openness to the world, our strength in diversity, our adaptability for the future. It symbolically connected Singapore and the world, through facilitating trade for our city's growth. It connected the culturally different towns of our Indian and Chinese migrants living on South Bridge Road, to the Malay and European community living across on North Bridge Road. The Elgin Bridge that we walk on today is a result of four major reconstructions over two centuries, adapting to the times of our society. Elgin Bridge continues to bear witness to our Singapore story – where we build connections with the world, re-invent ourselves for the future, bridge our differences and forge a shared identity amidst our diversity."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01105,2022-03-10-T-011,1105,Alvin Tan,"Mr Chairman, I will first touch on our youths, who will realise our future. Together with them, we will continue to build bridges to the world, towards our shared future vision of Singapore and with one another."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01106,2022-03-10-T-011,1106,Alvin Tan,"I chat regularly with our youths, and two issues that they deeply care about are the future of work and mental well-being. I will focus on both."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01107,2022-03-10-T-011,1107,Alvin Tan,"Ms Hany Soh asked how we can better support our youths, especially in their jobs, finances and mental well-being. Our youths know they need to prepare themselves for their future careers and desire three things  (a) opportunities to learn, (b) concrete skills to offer, and (c) guidance along the way."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01108,2022-03-10-T-011,1108,Alvin Tan,"That is why we are building bridges to our region and beyond, to help them to seize new opportunities. For example, we are building bridges all the way with Latin America – a region with immense growth potential, to help Singapore startups enter."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01109,2022-03-10-T-011,1109,Alvin Tan,"Singapore established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Colombia, and a partnership with venture capital (VC) firm, Latin Leap, to promote closer collaboration with companies in Latin America, especially in areas of artificial intelligence, fintech and sustainability."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01110,2022-03-10-T-011,1110,Alvin Tan,"Our youths who are setting their sights beyond Singapore can, therefore, look forward to more global opportunities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01111,2022-03-10-T-011,1111,Alvin Tan,"During the Budget Debates, Mr Desmond Choo referred to our youths as ""Generation COVID-19"" – coming-of-age during the pandemic, in an era of many opportunities, but also, unique challenges. Our youths need the confidence to seize opportunities by acquiring concrete skills and knowledge, and we have developed three initiatives on this."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01112,2022-03-10-T-011,1112,Alvin Tan,"First, our Asia-Ready Exposure Programme (AEP) helps bridge our youths to the region. Through online content and physical trips when possible, we are developing our youths' cross-cultural skills for opportunities in Asia."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01113,2022-03-10-T-011,1113,Alvin Tan,"Our AEP recently collaborated with the Ministry of Trade and Industry Academy on a webinar programme titled ""Regional Economies and Trade"", to equip our youths with insights on market economies, like ASEAN, China and India."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01114,2022-03-10-T-011,1114,Alvin Tan,"Our youths learnt first-hand from industry leaders in Asia, from companies like Quest Ventures, a top VC fund in Asia; YCH Group, a leading regional supply chain management partner; and Riverwalk Holdings, an India-focused VC fund, on what it is like to work abroad and what skills you need to succeed in the region."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01115,2022-03-10-T-011,1115,Alvin Tan,"Second, we are creating opportunities to bridge our youths to local organisations, in the community and social sectors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01116,2022-03-10-T-011,1116,Alvin Tan,"At the height of COVID-19, we rolled out our Youth Corps Internship Scheme, which provided more than 700 youths with internship experiences since September 2020. We will build on this as we recover from the pandemic. Through the Youth Corps Community Internship (YCCI), MCCY and NYC will partner social and community organisations to offer internships, with priority given to ITE and the Polytechnics. Our youths can pick up skills like event and project management, marketing and community engagement."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01117,2022-03-10-T-011,1117,Alvin Tan,"Third, we will build and strengthen bridges for our youths, with mentors, as they navigate life's many milestones."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01118,2022-03-10-T-011,1118,Alvin Tan,Ms. Rahayu Mahzam's question about mentoring opportunities to support our youths emotionally is thus key. Mentoring will play a key part in the upstream.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01119,2022-03-10-T-011,1119,Alvin Tan,"That is why we launched our Mentoring Alliance for Action (AfA) last year, to build a stronger mentoring culture in Singapore, especially for youths undergoing life's many transitions, be it from school-to-work, or when switching careers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01120,2022-03-10-T-011,1120,Alvin Tan,"So, to any youth looking for a mentor, the Mentoring AfA has established WeConnect, Singapore's first dedicated online mentoring platform, where you can find programmes, ranging from mentoring opportunities to community groups, for your personal life-stages. Through WeConnect, you can connect with a pool of over 1,000 volunteer mentors, which is growing, coming from companies like P&G, Unilever and Meta. You can learn from mentors who have traversed career journeys across industries like tech, logistics, media. By the end of this month, you can register on WeConnect. And I highly encourage you to do so."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01121,2022-03-10-T-011,1121,Alvin Tan,"Next, building bridges of mutual support. Ms Tin Pei Ling asked how we are supporting youths struggling with mental health. During the Budget debates, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Ms Nadia Samdin stressed the importance of stronger mental health support in Singapore. I agree with them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01122,2022-03-10-T-011,1122,Alvin Tan,"Even as the pandemic wanes, mental health issues will not just disappear with it. We need to reinforce support for our youths. We want our youths to know that it is okay to reach out and share about their mental health and well-being without fear of judgement."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01123,2022-03-10-T-011,1123,Alvin Tan,"To build supportive communities, we will expand peer support networks across various settings, be it in schools, workplaces, online and in the community. MCCY and NYC are partnering our Youth Sector Organisations, like Campus Psy and Young NTUC, to run peer support network programmes. We are also encouraging trained peer supporters from ITE, Polytechnics and Universities to continue serving the community after graduation, by joining our Youth Corps Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01124,2022-03-10-T-011,1124,Alvin Tan,"And our youths are leading the way on mental health awareness. The Happiness Initiative, Calm Collective and Limitless, are just three of the many ground-up initiatives they are spearheading. And to bring together these efforts, the Government started our Youth Mental Well-being Network (YMWBN) in 2020. Since then, more than 1,500 individuals, comprising youths, parents, caregivers, mental health professionals, have started more than 20 ground-up projects to support youths' mental well-being."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01125,2022-03-10-T-011,1125,Alvin Tan,"But mental health issues do not only affect our youths. So, to achieve even greater impact, we will expand the efforts of the YMWBN to a broader network, which will tackle mental health issues across a broader range of population segments, as mentioned by Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary in his speech."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01126,2022-03-10-T-011,1126,Alvin Tan,"This wider network will be a platform for those who can deliver mental health and well-being outcomes, like Campus Psy and Calm Collective, to come together and spearhead initiatives, with funding support."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01127,2022-03-10-T-011,1127,Alvin Tan,"For those who would benefit from these initiatives, the Network could help you find useful services and initiatives more easily. So, whether you are an organisation, a student, a middle-age PMET, or senior looking for mental well-being support, we welcome you to be part of this effort. MCCY will support this network, which will be advised by the Interagency Taskforce for Mental Health and Well-being."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01128,2022-03-10-T-011,1128,Alvin Tan,I feel privileged to chair this network with the support of my colleagues Minister of State Sun Xueling and Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam. We will announce more details later this year.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01129,2022-03-10-T-011,1129,Alvin Tan,We have learnt a lot from the YMWBN and we will build upon the learnings and networks to build a more inclusive Singapore that prioritises our mental well-being.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01130,2022-03-10-T-011,1130,Alvin Tan,"Next, we must look ahead, or construct new bridges to our desired future, with our youths. At MCCY, we have already begun the work and are now seeing the early fruits of our labour through the Youth Action Challenge (YAC) and the Somerset Belt."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01131,2022-03-10-T-011,1131,Alvin Tan,"Through the YAC, any youth with an idea and a desire to tackle the problems of our day, can pitch their innovative project idea and receive grants to realise these solutions. Since 2019, we have worked with over 700 youths, who have formed more than 170 project teams, to tackle societal issues, ranging from environment and sustainability, to support for vulnerable groups. Many of their projects have made tangible impact."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01132,2022-03-10-T-011,1132,Alvin Tan,"Take, for example, the team Skilio, founded by our youths Felix, Dody and Zhi Hui, with a simple but ambitious vision  creating a society where we are recognised for our unique strengths – not defined by the schools we go to, or the letters on our report cards. Skilio puts these ideals into a tangible product – a digital portfolio that helps youths document any soft skills picked up along their educational journey, to pursue their dream careers."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01133,2022-03-10-T-011,1133,Alvin Tan,"With YAC's support, Skilio has expanded its offerings, giving our youths free access to build these portfolios, and connects them to companies based on their unique qualities and skillsets. Thus far, over 5,000 students across 11 different schools and organisations have joined Skilio, with the potential to scale. This reflects how our youths' ideas can and have made an impact, and, indeed, a difference to many."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01134,2022-03-10-T-011,1134,Alvin Tan,"We are also offering our youths a dedicated physical space to prototype their ideas and implement ground-up programmes for social causes through our Somerset Belt. Since 2019, Somerset Belt has supported more than 20 ground-up projects, reaching more than 20,000 youths on causes like arts, environment and more. In the year ahead, we will partner institutes like Singapore Polytechnic and Singapore University of Technology and Design to translate ideas from classrooms and studios into real life. We will also refresh and enhance the spaces within Somerset Belt in the coming years. Thus far, we have sought ideas from over 240 youths on how they envision or want to use this space. Some envision the Belt to be a Creative Hub, with experimental retail spaces. We will continue to grow and make our youth-initiated ideas come alive through funding support. We will announce more details on the refresh works on the Somerset Belt later this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01135,2022-03-10-T-011,1135,Alvin Tan,"Mr Chairman, we have already seen early fruits from the YAC and the Somerset Belt. In time, especially with the upcoming YAC Season 4 starting October, we will see even more youths coming forward to make their impact, and, in fact, I welcome youths to come and join our YAC Season 4. Mr Chairman, I would like to speak in Mandarin, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01136,2022-03-10-T-011,1136,Alvin Tan,(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about other plans for youths to take action on social causes.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01137,2022-03-10-T-011,1137,Alvin Tan,"We will continue to empower our youths to make a difference, starting from where they live. We will expand and provide 1,500 locale-based volunteering opportunities through Youth Corp Singapore (YCS)'s partnership with SG Cares Volunteer Centres, SSO ComLink and other social service agencies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01138,2022-03-10-T-011,1138,Alvin Tan,"We will match our youths to neighbours in need, to support underprivileged families, senior citizens and more."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01139,2022-03-10-T-011,1139,Alvin Tan,"Combined with locale-based offerings, YCS offers a total of 7,500 opportunities where any youth with a heart to serve can step forward to bridge gaps in our society."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01140,2022-03-10-T-011,1140,Alvin Tan,
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01141,2022-03-10-T-011,1141,Alvin Tan,(In English)  I will next talk about building our youths' civic capacity for constructive discourse with one another.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01142,2022-03-10-T-011,1142,Alvin Tan,"Today, with tech and social media as the frontiers for social discourse, we need to strengthen mutual understanding, especially on key and contentious societal issues. While we see more open discussions on social media, we also see growing polarisation, echo chambers and the rise of cancel culture."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01143,2022-03-10-T-011,1143,Alvin Tan,"When I spoke with youths at the launch of the Inter-University Network last month, they shared with me their wish to discuss difficult and controversial issues frankly. They want to work with us to build what they call safe spaces and also guardrails to do so. That is why Prof Koh Lian Pin's question about opportunities for youth participation on topics of national interest is key, relevant and timely."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01144,2022-03-10-T-011,1144,Alvin Tan,We will work with our youths to create safe platforms for them to explore and engage in a diversity of views and help them build empathy towards those who hold different views.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01145,2022-03-10-T-011,1145,Alvin Tan,"From April to September this year, the National Youth Council will partner Mediacorp to launch a digital engagement campaign called ""Civic Conversations"". We will highlight important norms and values that should guide our conversations and create spaces for respectful and deep dialogue. We will address key topics like race and religion, local-foreigner relations and intergenerational bonding."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01146,2022-03-10-T-011,1146,Alvin Tan,Our youths can participate in a variety of online platforms like Instagram Live! sessions with expert panels and access the content through a microsite. They will pick up useful tips on how to engage in difficult conversations and converse constructively on complex issues.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01147,2022-03-10-T-011,1147,Alvin Tan,"Mr Chairman, we must consciously strengthen the bridges that connect us, not just across the diversity of our perspectives but also across our different racial, religious and ethnic backgrounds."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01148,2022-03-10-T-011,1148,Alvin Tan,Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman asked about our integration efforts to build a cohesive society and bridge societal fault lines.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01149,2022-03-10-T-011,1149,Alvin Tan,"In addition to the work of our Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) as covered by Minister Edwin Tong, our National Integration Council and Singapore Citizenship Journey are important platforms for this. Both platforms help us to strengthen the bridges between locals and newcomers to Singapore. We must never forget that Singapore's story has always been one of an immigrant nation embracing diversity and being open to the world."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01150,2022-03-10-T-011,1150,Alvin Tan,"As part of our Emerging Stronger Conversations, members of the National Integration Council (NIC) candidly discussed challenges around local-foreigner relations, particularly arising from COVID-19. We developed three key themes that the NIC's Alliance for Action and its projects will focus on."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01151,2022-03-10-T-011,1151,Alvin Tan,"First, to create more shared experiences and interactions through a community orientation programme and volunteering opportunities where newcomers and locals can have meaningful interactions. Second, to share positive stories that inspire us to embrace the vibrancy of our diverse backgrounds and common aspirations. Third, to empower and equip more to speak up on sensitive issues relating to diversity and inclusion by developing workshops and programmes."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01152,2022-03-10-T-011,1152,Alvin Tan,"Together, 20 representatives from 15 different community groups, corporations and grassroot organisations will co-create and drive these projects. Everyone can play a part in this effort."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01153,2022-03-10-T-011,1153,Alvin Tan,The efforts of the IRCCs and the NIC emphasise our shared Singaporean identity. But what does it mean to be Singaporean and to live in Singapore?
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01154,2022-03-10-T-011,1154,Alvin Tan,"Through our Citizens' Workgroup for Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ) in 2020, Singaporeans answered this question. They reflected that it is our shared languages and experience. It is how we order kopi with our uniquely Singaporean language, whether it is ""kopi-o"" or ""kopi-c"" or ""kopi peng"". It is our community spirit and shared values where we believe it is our responsibility to care for one another and to leave no one behind."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01155,2022-03-10-T-011,1155,Alvin Tan,"Thanks to our citizens' contributions, we have included refreshed content in our e-Journey and new e-Book, such as our arts and culture and aspirations for Singapore's future. You can experience the e-Journey now through the Singapore Journey website and look forward to the launch of the e-Book next month, titled ""Welcome to Singapore"". I hope these resources remind us about the heart of being a Singaporean. Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01156,2022-03-10-T-011,1156,Alvin Tan,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, our IRCCs, NIC and SCJ strengthen the ties between our different ethnic and religious communities. The solidarity they foster is our nation's source of strength, which we must not take for granted."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01157,2022-03-10-T-011,1157,Alvin Tan,"Walking across Elgin Bridge towards South Bridge Road, we can see how our diversity exists in harmony. Along this one road, we have the Masjid Jamae Chulia, Sri Mariamman Temple, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Fairfield Methodist Church."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01158,2022-03-10-T-011,1158,Alvin Tan,"This is the diversity that our forefathers built our nation on. By building stronger bridges across communities, our diversity will continue to be our defining strength."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01159,2022-03-10-T-011,1159,Alvin Tan,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, Minister Edwin Tong reminded us that our transition out of the pandemic will not be without obstacles. Great cities, including strong bridges, were not built in a day nor by a single person or group. This mirrors the words that our former President, Mr Yusof Ishak said more than 50 years ago, ""In every brick, stone, stool that makes up Singapore, there is contained the effort and energies of generations of men, starting with the early immigrants. The whole fabric of Singapore society is woven out of the thread of human effort, labour and purpose."""
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01160,2022-03-10-T-011,1160,Alvin Tan,"As we embark on the next arc of our Singapore story, it is now our time, our turn, to build on these foundations and create new bridges to the world, towards our shared future and with one another. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01161,2022-03-10-T-011,1161,,Mr Eric Chua.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01162,2022-03-10-T-011,1162,Eric Chua,"Chairman, COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work and play. These past two-plus years, we have had to fight the pandemic together, yet acutely apart. This long fight has been draining. But like other crises we have weathered before, we can overcome COVID-19. But to do so, we must strengthen the sense of ""us""."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01163,2022-03-10-T-011,1163,Eric Chua,"I will now outline how MCCY will build a more caring, inclusive and united society through volunteerism and sports. Ms Hany Soh and Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about efforts to build a more sustainable sports ecosystem. We are doing so in three ways."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01164,2022-03-10-T-011,1164,Eric Chua,"First, we are greening our sport infrastructure like the upcoming Punggol Regional Sport Centre in 2024 and the Kallang Alive Precinct into a sports and recreational Green Mark District."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01165,2022-03-10-T-011,1165,Eric Chua,"Second, we are partnering the sports industry to reduce, recondition and recycle sports equipment. SportSG will ensure that all its supported events attain green certification by 2023."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01166,2022-03-10-T-011,1166,Eric Chua,"Third, we will rally our National Sports Associations (NSAs), Team Nila volunteers and ActiveSG Sport Centres to amplify our sustainability efforts. We have brought community gardens like the one Ms Hany Soh described to other ActiveSG Sport Centres to cultivate community ties through green initiatives."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01167,2022-03-10-T-011,1167,Eric Chua,Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about opportunities for Singaporeans to volunteer and to care for others.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01168,2022-03-10-T-011,1168,Eric Chua,"Through the SG Cares movement, MCCY will work with community partners to make volunteerism our way of life."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01169,2022-03-10-T-011,1169,Eric Chua,"First, SG Cares is partnering professional bodies, such as the Law Society Pro Bono Services, to champion skills-based volunteerism. We aim to grow regular volunteers and deepen our culture of care and service to the community within these professional bodies."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01170,2022-03-10-T-011,1170,Eric Chua,"Second, in every town, the SG Cares Volunteer Centres (VCs) and SG Cares Community Networks are fostering collaborations with partners, such as schools, corporates, ground-up movements and Social Service Agencies (SSAs), to channel volunteers to areas of need."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01171,2022-03-10-T-011,1171,Eric Chua,"Third, we will continue to enhance our charities' capabilities. As shared by the Finance Minister, we will extend the Charities Capability Fund from FY2022 to FY2026. Charities and Institutions of a Public Character will continue to receive funding support to strengthen their governance and management capabilities."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01172,2022-03-10-T-011,1172,Eric Chua,"Lastly, we have made volunteering even more accessible through the SSAs and SG Cares VCs, which have pivoted to virtual volunteering opportunities, such as online storytelling and exercise sessions, that engage diverse age groups."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01173,2022-03-10-T-011,1173,Eric Chua,"Mr Xie Yao Quan rightly pointed out that sports have the power to uplift underserved communities and change lives. Indeed, sports are a powerful force for good and a great social leveller."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01174,2022-03-10-T-011,1174,Eric Chua,"SportSG's SportCares will partner MSF's ComLink to offer programmes like its flagship ""Saturday Night Lights"", a structured football programme, to families with children and youths living in rental housing. This will be launched to all 21 ComLink towns, but starting with five this year. We hope to reach out to 28,000 children and youths across about 300 public rental housing blocks by 2027."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01175,2022-03-10-T-011,1175,Eric Chua,"Sports also play a critical developmental role for youths. It shapes character, teaches resilience and teamwork and builds communities. SportCares will launch two initiatives."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01176,2022-03-10-T-011,1176,Eric Chua,"First, a mentorship programme. I agree with Ms Rahayu Mahzam. Having mentored ITE students myself for many years, I strongly believe that every youth has potential, regardless of what their starting point in life is."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01177,2022-03-10-T-011,1177,Eric Chua,"In addition to WeConnect that Minister of State Alvin Tan mentioned earlier, SportCares has launched a mentoring programme to support 100 disadvantaged young people over the next two years."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01178,2022-03-10-T-011,1178,Eric Chua,"Second, we will support our youths through internships, scholarships and bursaries."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01179,2022-03-10-T-011,1179,Eric Chua,"From July, SportCares will offer industry attachments within SportSG and industry partners. SportCares has also committed $400,000 towards the SportCares Scholarship. Up to 20 SportCares youths will be supported to pursue either a NITEC, tertiary or undergraduate course in a locally recognised institution. Up to 1,400 children, youths and persons with disabilities (PwDs) from low-income backgrounds will benefit from the SportCares Bursary Scheme, which covers the fees to any ActiveSG Academies and Clubs programme for at least a season of 10 weeks."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01180,2022-03-10-T-011,1180,Eric Chua,"Mr Darryl David, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about efforts to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01181,2022-03-10-T-011,1181,Eric Chua,"In my MSF speech earlier, I spoke about the Enabling Masterplan 2030 and our whole-of-society efforts to make Singapore more inclusive. To that end, disability sports play an important role."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01182,2022-03-10-T-011,1182,Eric Chua,"Since the launch of the Disability Sports Masterplan (DSMP) in 2016, we have made good progress. We widened the base of disability sports participation. The number of PwDs participating in sports has grown from one in three in 2016 to one in two today. We will make our sports facilities more accessible and will make all ActiveSG Gyms inclusive by 2026. We have also promoted inclusion through sharing sporting experiences."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01183,2022-03-10-T-011,1183,Eric Chua,Mr Mark Chay raised the importance of empowering coaches to better support PwDs. Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked if expertise in this area is sufficiently widespread.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01184,2022-03-10-T-011,1184,Eric Chua,"Today, CoachSG runs curated coaching courses under the Special Olympics Singapore and Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC). About 2,800 coaches, educators, volunteers, staff and students have been trained in inclusive sports programmes. To equip more coaches with disability sports coaching competencies, CoachSG will incorporate this into the National Registry of Coaches' (NROC) SG-Coach Level Two curriculum this year."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01185,2022-03-10-T-011,1185,Eric Chua,"In summary, the DSMP has benefited more than 18,000 persons with disabilities to date. We will continue to do this and more."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01186,2022-03-10-T-011,1186,Eric Chua,"This year, SportSG will introduce 10 sports programmes under the new Para Sport Academy, starting with Cerebral Palsy Football, Para-canoe and Athletics. The Para Sport Academy will drive the integration of disability and mainstream sports in our ActiveSG Academies and Clubs. They will also provide aspiring para-athletes a clear pathway from recreational participation to high-performance sports. We hope that the Para Sport Academy will be an enabling platform through which more persons with disabilities can build their self-confidence and reach their fullest potential. It is also our ambition to grow a new generation of para-athletes who will go on to represent Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01187,2022-03-10-T-011,1187,Eric Chua,"To better ensure that the Para Sport Academy serves the needs of para-athletes, SportSG has established an advisory panel comprising prominent members of the disability sports community. With their extensive experience in and contributions to para sports, the panel will be well-placed to co-design and grow the Para Sport Academy."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01188,2022-03-10-T-011,1188,Eric Chua,"Mr Mark Chay spoke about raising coaching standards and recognising coaches. On raising coaching standards and regulations, SportSG is working on creating a larger national registry to include coaches and fitness instructors."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01189,2022-03-10-T-011,1189,Eric Chua,"Under the Safe Coach Programme that is being rolled out, all sports participants in member organisations, including administrators and volunteers will be bound by the Safe Sport Unified Code."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01190,2022-03-10-T-011,1190,Eric Chua,"Mr Mark Chay also asked about the Coaching Competency Framework that CoachSG is developing with Leeds Beckett University. This will inform our formal coach education curriculum. When recognised as part of the sport sector Industry Transformation Map, coaches can use the framework to compare the competencies and remuneration of coaching against jobs in adjacent sectors, thereby promoting greater occupational mobility. With established recommended rates, coaches will be remunerated fairly and it is our hope that the coaching profession will become more attractive."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01191,2022-03-10-T-011,1191,Eric Chua,"On recognising our coaches, today there are various awards, such as the Coach of the Year Award by the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and SDSC, as well as CoachSG's Singapore Coach Medallion."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01192,2022-03-10-T-011,1192,Eric Chua,I thank Mr Mark Chay on his interest on various issues and welcome him to continue working closely with us.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01193,2022-03-10-T-011,1193,Eric Chua,"Chairman, 2022 will be yet another busy year for our Team Singapore athletes, as they represent Singapore at the Hanoi SEA Games, the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, the Surakarta ASEAN Para Games and the Hangzhou Asian and Asian Para Games. Keeping in top form will be of utmost importance and Mr Mark Chay will be reassured to know that we are supporting our athletes as best as we can."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01194,2022-03-10-T-011,1194,Eric Chua,"Our support for national athletes is comprehensive and takes both financial and non-financial forms. Each year, the Government spends more than $70 million in high-performance sports, over and above the $90 million on sports infrastructure. Funding support for major games is also planned in advance and accounted for within the NSA's multi-year sports plan."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01195,2022-03-10-T-011,1195,Eric Chua,"We also continually invest resources to enhance the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) and the National Youth Sport Institute (NYSI). Today, both have quality infrastructure to provide sports science and medicine support to our national athletes. Whether it is access to funding, sports science or medicine, the support rendered to each athlete is customised based on individual needs, and specific demands of their sport."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01196,2022-03-10-T-011,1196,Eric Chua,"On National Service, the priority of full-time National Servicemen is their military duties. We are working with MINDEF to support our Team Singapore athletes to address their sports training needs while fulfilling military duties. Provisions like short-term deferment, leave and time-off to train and compete are available, subject to the SAF's operational needs."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01197,2022-03-10-T-011,1197,Eric Chua,Corporates and Singaporeans can also contribute to our athletes' journeys. Mr Xie Yao Quan asked about the One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF) and efforts to encourage a spirit of giving to sports. Mr Darryl David asked about efforts to rally Singaporeans to support Team Singapore.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01198,2022-03-10-T-011,1198,Eric Chua,"As previously announced by the Finance Minister, we are extending the $50 million OTSF Matching Grant for an additional five years until FY2026 and to cover more areas of high-performance sports support. The OTSF offers one-to-one matching for donations and has matched almost $15 million since its inception in 2017. Your donations and matching grant will benefit our athletes."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01199,2022-03-10-T-011,1199,Eric Chua,"We will also establish Team Singapore Cares, a platform for Team Singapore athletes to serve and give back. Team Singapore athletes will be able to tap on the Active Citizen Grant to spearhead initiatives. SportSG will also support them to connect them with Corporate Partners who can help to co-fund these projects."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01200,2022-03-10-T-011,1200,Eric Chua,"Finally, football. I thank Miss Cheng Li Hui, Mr Darryl David, Mr Abdul Samad and Mr Faisal Manap for their passion in Singapore football. Allow me to provide an update on the progress on ""Unleash the Roar!"", our national project to uplift Singapore football."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01201,2022-03-10-T-011,1201,Eric Chua,"This year, we started 10 School Football Academies (SFAs) in Secondary schools. We want to provide a nurturing environment for students to hone their football skills while supporting them academically. Almost 400 students have enrolled in our SFAs. Our ambition is to grow them to full capacity over the next few years with a total of 16 SFAs for boys across all Secondary levels. And we also plan to establish SFAs for girls as well."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01202,2022-03-10-T-011,1202,Eric Chua,"A key factor in the SFAs' success is quality coaching. To give our students the best training environment, each SFA will feature a dedicated Head Coach, assistant coaches and zonal specialist coaches."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01203,2022-03-10-T-011,1203,Eric Chua,"To go far, we must work with the right partners. We are working with LaLiga to bring in nine Head Coaches who have experience developing young, high-performance footballers to lead our SFAs. These coaches will join us in April. We are also partnering Borussia Dortmund, a top professional football club in the Bundesliga, famed for its focus on youth talent development."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01204,2022-03-10-T-011,1204,Eric Chua,"We are also grooming our local coaches. We have begun recruiting local assistant coaches. Five have started coaching since mid-January, and we will onboard 12 more by April. To ensure high-quality football coaching, more than 300 coaches and MOE teachers have also been trained to adopt our National Football Curriculum."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01205,2022-03-10-T-011,1205,Eric Chua,"""Unleash the Roar!"" is a project committed to levelling up Singapore football for the long haul. Beyond youth and coach development, we will set into motion other plans."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01206,2022-03-10-T-011,1206,Eric Chua,"First, we will launch the ""Unleash the Roar!"" scholarship to nurture young talents later this year. The scholarship will provide financial support to talented and committed footballers to immerse themselves in a high-performance football environment abroad while pursuing their studies. We also plan to support more young talents to go overseas on stints to broaden their exposure."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01207,2022-03-10-T-011,1207,Eric Chua,"Second, we will do more for women's football here in Singapore. We will grow the participation base by introducing more programmes for girls under the ActiveSG Football Academy. We will provide our women footballers greater support by way of training facilities, coaching and sports science."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01208,2022-03-10-T-011,1208,Eric Chua,"Third, beyond the resumption of the Singapore Premier League (SPL), MCCY and SportSG have been working with partners, such as the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), on opportunities for our football teams to compete with international teams on home ground. Singaporeans can look forward to supporting the Lions at the upcoming football triangular series against the Philippines and Malaysia."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01209,2022-03-10-T-011,1209,Eric Chua,"I am sure some Members of the House also fondly recall the Lion City Cup. Pandemic restrictions aside, we hope to bring our young competitors from the region into Singapore, so that our youths can compete at a high level and, at the same time, generate excitement about youth football."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01210,2022-03-10-T-011,1210,Eric Chua,"Finally, we are in discussions with FAS to transform the SPL by increasing professional standards and strengthening private sponsorship. We look forward to sharing more when these plans are firmed up."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01211,2022-03-10-T-011,1211,Eric Chua,Mr Faisal Manap asked about the replacement of our national coach. I understand the FAS' recruitment process for this position has been set in motion and we will be hearing from them in due course.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01212,2022-03-10-T-011,1212,Eric Chua,"Sir, ""Unleash the Roar!"" is a mammoth undertaking. Many have asked me how I felt, leading the charge on this front. I would be lying if I said I do not have butterflies in my stomach. But today, I am hopeful. Why? Because of the many passionate individuals I had spent hours talking to about this project. Because they believe in Singapore football. And because of our Lions, the way they fought their Indonesian rivals at the Suzuki Cup semi-finals last year on Christmas Day! And most of all, because of how Singaporeans reacted to them."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01213,2022-03-10-T-011,1213,Eric Chua,"What we witnessed that night has got to be one of the most, if not the most gripping, Singapore football performance in recent history. We all rallied behind our Lions. And the immense sense of pride that we felt when Majulah Singapura filled the National Stadium – never mind that there were only 10,000 of us that evening! That experience was simply priceless."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01214,2022-03-10-T-011,1214,Eric Chua,"That, Members of this Chamber, is the power of sports, the power of football, and that is why we must believe in Singapore football and we must believe that we can Unleash the Roar!"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01215,2022-03-10-T-011,1215,Eric Chua,"Sir, I began by talking about the importance of strengthening our collective sense of ""us"". I would like to end by saying that we are laying the foundations for a better future today."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01216,2022-03-10-T-011,1216,Eric Chua,"Across our different sectors – community, arts, sports, youth – we all have a role to play in shaping a Singapore that is caring, cohesive and confident. It is our strength in unity and collective fortitude that will enable us to overcome the pandemic and build a brighter tomorrow, and a stronger Singapore Together. [Applause.]"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01217,2022-03-10-T-011,1217,,"Clarifications, please. Ms Hany Soh."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01218,2022-03-10-T-011,1218,Hany Soh,"Thank you, Chairman. This clarification is in relation to Youth Corp Community Internship (YCCI), which Minister of State Alvin Tan had shared with us earlier on the internship opportunities for youths in the social and community sectors in Singapore. I wish to enquire whether we can consider extending it to overseas opportunities in this aspect as well."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01219,2022-03-10-T-011,1219,Hany Soh,"One example is the youth exchange programme organised previously by the Central CDC under its High 5 Youth initiative many years ago, which I personally benefited as a student leader. Awardees participate in the exchange programme in countries, such as Australia and Xiamen, China, to better understand the local community's good practices on matters, such as intergenerational bonding, and put them into practice when they return to Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01220,2022-03-10-T-011,1220,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for her clarification. The YCCI programme is one of many different programmes and it is starting in the second quarter of this year. But I wanted to let the Member know that we have other programmes and one of the most appropriate ones is called the Youth Expedition Project (YEP), which is run by Youth Corp Singapore for youths to, in fact, do what exactly the Member mentioned – to serve other communities overseas."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01221,2022-03-10-T-011,1221,Alvin Tan,"Pre-COVID-19, we sent about four to five thousand youths every year for two-week community service stints with overseas youth organisations. The YEP programme usually spans about four to six months if you factor in preparation, planning as well as post-trip reflections. We intend to restart YEP. We have it online now; so, it is YEP Go Online. This is not as ideal as we would love to, because nothing beats being there physically, but we plan to restart it very soon, hopefully, when travel resumes."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01222,2022-03-10-T-011,1222,Alvin Tan,"The other programme is the Asia Exposure Ready Programme (AEP), which will expand support to travel-based programmes, when it is possible, for a more experiential and more community-based experience for youths overseas. So, we have these programmes in place and we hope to restart these programmes when travel resumes."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01223,2022-03-10-T-011,1223,,Mr Mark Chay.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01224,2022-03-10-T-011,1224,Mark Chay,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would just like to make two clarifications. One is to ask the Minister about the establishment of gaming, digital content and technology hub and the second is on the Para Sports Academy. How many athletes will it impact? At what level will it impact? And what are the tangible goals to understand what the success of this Para Sports Academy will look like?"
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01225,2022-03-10-T-011,1225,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank the Member Mr Chay for his questions. To deal with his first point, Mr Chay might be pleased to know that we have been working with partners, such as the Global Sport Innovation Centre (GSIC), and just a few months back in December last year, GSIC launched the Asia Pacific HQ in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01226,2022-03-10-T-011,1226,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Having partners like GSIC in Singapore means that we will aggregate the thought leadership in Singapore.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01227,2022-03-10-T-011,1227,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As Members know, with gaming, technology and innovation, there is a natural synergy, a confluence of various aspects of this gaming and fitness industry. And we will have a place in Singapore where we will have content and game developers coalesce, we will have hardware developers as well, and, of course, those who are involved in technology, including things like wearables, which are gaining prevalence in the way in which we do fitness. So, all of that will be in Singapore and we intend to work with them to develop this ecosystem and strengthen Singapore's position for sport-tech solutions."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01228,2022-03-10-T-011,1228,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In relation to the para sports academies, we intend to work with several sports first, as a start. In the first instance, we will probably use the existing framework and infrastructure and work with the Disabilities Sports Council to see how we can move the para-athletes into the system in this way. I think that is the fastest way to scale up."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01229,2022-03-10-T-011,1229,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over time, I appreciate that each sport may be different and the way in which we train, nurture and develop our para-athletes may be different sport to sport, and may also be different between a para-athlete and an able-bodied athlete. But, as we develop the base and infrastructure, we will begin to scale up with the expertise so that more of them can enter the system in this way."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01230,2022-03-10-T-011,1230,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As to Mr Mark Chay's point about what are the potential pathways, we intend to put them on the same platform as the able-bodied athletes. If the able-bodied athletes have a certain pathway opportunity, we intend to make sure that we put the para-athletes on the same track, on the same path, so that there is equality, if not in terms of outcomes, certainly, in terms of where the starting point should be."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01231,2022-03-10-T-011,1231,,Mr Darryl David.
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01232,2022-03-10-T-011,1232,Darryl David,"Chairman, I just have one clarification. It is very heartening to hear the plans shared by Minister of State Low Yen Ling and Minister Edwin Tong about how they intend to support, invigorate and promote the arts industry in Singapore."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01233,2022-03-10-T-011,1233,Darryl David,"Minister Edwin Tong talked about having safe spaces for the arts, for expression and development. He talked about 45 Armenian Street. I would just like to ask the Minister if he could perhaps expound a bit more on whether there will be more of such spaces that will be provided for our arts community and also what are some of the resources and facilities that could perhaps be put in place in these spaces."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01234,2022-03-10-T-011,1234,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Thank you, Mr Darryl David. When it comes to arts spaces, our objective is really, one. Given Singapore's land scarcity, we want to ensure optimal usage and efficiency in usage; second, we want to ensure that there is fair access because we have new and younger groups coming through and we want to ensure that, for the space, there is sufficient turnover, so that they can also occupy the spaces and there are opportunities for these new growing groups to incubate and experiment; and, finally, we want these spaces to continue to remain relevant. In some cases, we update the spaces, so that old spaces can be used for new purposes."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01235,2022-03-10-T-011,1235,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over time, I think we have had the opportunity to grow the spaces available. If you take just the real estate purposes, over the last 10 years, we have grown it by about 35% in terms of absolute real estate space dedicated to arts users. And we continually look at how we can refresh the existing spaces. I will just give you some examples, some of which my colleagues have touched on earlier."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01236,2022-03-10-T-011,1236,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have the Tanjong Pagar Distripark (TPD). We all know that it used to be a place where container cranes and so on occupy those spaces. It is an unlikely space.  But if you think about it, it is actually quite intuitive to use it as an arts space – high ceilings, large walls – you can have displays there that you cannot otherwise do in our current settings or spaces. So, we are using this as an experiment to develop this into a new hub for arts spaces."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01237,2022-03-10-T-011,1237,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Member spoke about 45 Armenian Street as well – 45 Armenian Street is a place with lots of history. Many of our arts practitioners know the place as a young experimental place with buzz where you come in, you incubate, you spend some time learning from each other as well. So, we wanted to develop this with the same kind of feeling and ethos. And it is in that respect that we invited practitioners, leaders of the arts community – Mae Anderson, Janice Koh, and I mentioned some names earlier – to come and share their experience with us and think in terms of how to envision this space for future use."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01238,2022-03-10-T-011,1238,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Kampong Java is another space that we looked at. All of you probably drive past it each day and not realise that it is there. It used to be used terrace houses that are now disused. So, we worked with SLA to take advantage of the fact that it has not been used and see how we could repurpose it. It used to be terrace properties, so, a little bit grungy, a little bit rundown, but quite perfect and ideal for arts spaces. So, we reimagined the space, thought about how these can become independent affordable spaces for, again, experimental and incubatory arts companies. And we are working with the arts industry also to get ideas as to how this can be managed and operated."
2022-03-10-T-011-S-01239,2022-03-10-T-011,1239,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These are some examples of the thinking in terms of how we can expand on existing spaces, old spaces, to bring them into new ones. And also, ultimately, use the spaces fairly and efficiently and ensuring that, as and when we have new companies, new ideas, new forms of art coming through, they will also have their space in the sun and be able to develop."

2022-03-10-T-015-S-01266,2022-03-10-T-015,1266,Speaker,Minister Chan Chun Sing. Clarification.
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01267,2022-03-10-T-015,1267,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, on 26 February 2021, I replied to Parliamentary Questions regarding development works at Kranji Road, Kranji Close. I told Parliament that JTC and NParks were conducting investigations into the execution of the land clearing at this site."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01268,2022-03-10-T-015,1268,Chan Chun Sing,"The matter was subsequently also referred for further investigations by other agencies, including the Police. Police investigations have just concluded and Police presented their conclusions to me and the relevant Ministers earlier this week."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01269,2022-03-10-T-015,1269,Chan Chun Sing,"Sir, the investigations have established that when the matter arose last year, two JTC officers, the project manager and the deputy director – who was the project manager's immediate supervisor – had provided inaccurate information to their superiors in JTC. The inaccurate information had then been conveyed to MTI and subsequently incorporated into the answers I gave to Parliament in the Parliamentary and supplementary questions in February 2021. [Please refer to ""Environmental Impact Study for Sungei Kadut Eco-district"", Official Report, 26 February 2021, Vol 95, Issue No 21, Oral Answers to Questions section.]"
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01270,2022-03-10-T-015,1270,Chan Chun Sing,"Some of the information I had presented to Parliament, based on what they had said was, therefore, inaccurate. I will set out the details of what happened."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01271,2022-03-10-T-015,1271,Chan Chun Sing,"Members may recall that this site included a stretch of the former Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) Railway line. After the railway line was returned to Singapore in 2011, the site was earmarked for Industrial Development."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01272,2022-03-10-T-015,1272,Chan Chun Sing,"At that time, the site comprised mainly scrubland. As the site was left vacant until development began, vegetation and trees were allowed to grow to provide green cover. During this time, non-native, fast-growing Albizia trees sprung up."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01273,2022-03-10-T-015,1273,Chan Chun Sing,"In 2019, the site was chosen to develop an Agri-Food Innovation Park to support Singapore's food resilience. JTC was appointed the developing agent. JTC proposed to retain the original KTM Railway line as a green corridor through the site, changing an earlier plan to realign the rail corridor away from the site."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01274,2022-03-10-T-015,1274,Chan Chun Sing,"In 2019, JTC appointed CPG as its consultant to carry out planning and design works for the site. The development of the site was to be carried out in phases."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01275,2022-03-10-T-015,1275,Chan Chun Sing,"With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I display a slide on the screen, please?"
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01276,2022-03-10-T-015,1276,Speaker,Yes. [
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01277,2022-03-10-T-015,1277,Chan Chun Sing,"Plots 4, 5 and 9, in purple and yellow, had been approved by NParks for clearance in August 2019. In February 2020, a contractor was appointed to clear Plot 9. Then, in March 2020, a different contractor, Huationg Contractor Pte Ltd, was appointed to perform works for the remaining plots."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01278,2022-03-10-T-015,1278,Chan Chun Sing,"In February last year, I had informed the House that ""Between end December 2020 and 13 January 2021"", unauthorised clearance work was carried out on 4.5 hectares of the site. The 4.5 hectares I referred to are the two areas marked in red on the slide."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01279,2022-03-10-T-015,1279,Chan Chun Sing,Investigations have since found that clearance of the red areas commenced without NParks' approval before December 2020. The investigations suggest that the two JTC officers had given inaccurate information to their JTC superiors about this. I will come back to this later.
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01280,2022-03-10-T-015,1280,Chan Chun Sing,"I also refer Members to the area marked in blue. When I spoke in Parliament, I told Members that we would thoroughly investigate the execution of the land clearing on the Kranji site. This included verifying the status of the various other plots on the site, including the blue area. Investigations have now established that the blue area, amounting to 2.8 hectares, had also been cleared without NParks' approval. Part of Plot 1, edged in green on the slide, had also been cleared before NParks granted approval in November 2020."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01281,2022-03-10-T-015,1281,Chan Chun Sing,"My statement that the contractor had ""not been paid for the over-clearance in January and December"" also needs to be corrected."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01282,2022-03-10-T-015,1282,Chan Chun Sing,"Investigations have found that some payments had been made for clearance, including tree-felling, for parts of the red areas during this period. This erroneous information was provided by JTC Contract and Procurement (Construction) Division, which processed the payments without realising that the payments included felling of trees in areas that had not been approved for clearance. There was no intent by JTC staff to mislead. Investigations have also found that payments were also made for clearance of some parts of the red areas and the blue area before December 2020, which we now know had been done without approval."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01283,2022-03-10-T-015,1283,Chan Chun Sing,"In addressing the Parliamentary Questions on 26 February 2021, I had said that the unauthorised land clearing ""was discovered by JTC's Project Manager on 13 January 2021 during his site visit. All clearance works onsite were suspended immediately and remain suspended today."" However, as I stated earlier, investigations have since found that the Project Manager who was in charge, knew of the clearance before 13 January 2021. His immediate superior, the Deputy Director, also knew. It appears that they misrepresented the facts and gave inaccurate information to their superiors."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01284,2022-03-10-T-015,1284,Chan Chun Sing,"As for clearance works being suspended immediately from 13 January 2021, JTC has clarified that it stopped all tree felling and focused on that as constituting clearance works. Some other minor work, like vegetation clearing, did continue beyond 13 January 2021."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01285,2022-03-10-T-015,1285,Chan Chun Sing,"Sir, I want to say this  the above statements are based on Police findings. Police have consulted AGC and referred the matter to AGC. AGC is now considering the matter."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01286,2022-03-10-T-015,1286,Chan Chun Sing,"In these circumstances, I considered whether to wait for AGC's decision whether to bring charges against officers before updating Parliament. This is for two reasons. First, what I have said above is based on the Police view, which could well be contested in Court, if the matter proceeds to Court. And a Court could take a different view of the facts. Second, we need to be fair to the persons who may be charged; setting out the facts here should not prejudice their fair trial."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01287,2022-03-10-T-015,1287,Chan Chun Sing,"After discussing with AGC, I was satisfied that I could update Parliament now on what the Police have found. But, I emphasise to Members that the above is the Police's view of the facts, and the matter could go to the Court."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01288,2022-03-10-T-015,1288,Chan Chun Sing,"There is a natural follow-up question  why did the officers do this? Sir, if and when the matter is brought before the Court, the reasons and motives of the officers will also likely be dealt with, apart from establishing the facts. Therefore, pending any Court proceedings, I have confined myself to an account of the facts as discovered by the Police investigations. We should be very circumspect about speculating on motives."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01289,2022-03-10-T-015,1289,Chan Chun Sing,"May I also add that there was no question as to whether or not the site would be developed. The whole site had been earmarked for development and, eventually, development would, definitely, have proceeded. However, there are processes to be followed, including getting timely approvals from NParks, and that process was not followed. NParks has confirmed that if the due process had been followed, it would have given approval, subject to the necessary conditions being met. However, regardless of whether approvals would have been forthcoming, the JTC officers had a duty to give the correct information to their supervisors and MTI. Failure to do so is wrong and cannot be excused."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01290,2022-03-10-T-015,1290,Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to briefly touch on the timeline of investigations  NParks' investigation began on 21 February 2021, just before my reply in Parliament last year. This investigation took some months and uncovered discrepancies in the information provided. But the two JTC officers I had earlier mentioned disputed that they had given misleading information. Given the unclear situation and the factual disputes, we first wanted to rule out any possible corruption. CPIB was asked to investigate and concluded that there had been no corruption."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01291,2022-03-10-T-015,1291,Chan Chun Sing,"The matter was then referred to the Police to get to the bottom of the factual disputes, establish what had happened and whether there was criminal conduct disclosed. The Police concluded their investigations earlier this month. As I have said, the Police updated me and the relevant Cabinet Ministers on their findings earlier this week and have referred the matter to the AGC."
2022-03-10-T-015-S-01292,2022-03-10-T-015,1292,Chan Chun Sing,"MTI is reviewing the investigation findings with JTC. Apart from possible Court proceedings, MTI and JTC will take appropriate disciplinary and administrative actions against any individuals responsible, as necessary."
2022-03-10-T-016-S-01293,2022-03-10-T-016,1293,,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn to 12.30 pm, tomorrow."" – [Ms Indranee Rajah]. (proc text)]"
2022-03-10-T-016-S-01294,2022-03-10-T-016,1294,,Adjourned accordingly at 7.23 pm.
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01295,2022-03-10-T-017,1295,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will consider providing support to improve the sick bay facilities in all preschools to allow preschools to keep sick children until the end of the school day.
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01296,2022-03-10-T-017,1296,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The health and well-being of the child is of utmost importance to any parent. It is in the interest of children who are unwell to receive comfort and attention from their parents, and for the parents to decide on the appropriate medical attention needed."
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01297,2022-03-10-T-017,1297,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Early Childhood Development Centres Act and Regulations require all preschools to have a designated area that is enclosed and separate from other teaching spaces to serve as a sick bay for children who become unwell during the course of the day. Preschools will place these unwell children in the sick bay and notify their parents or guardians.
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01298,2022-03-10-T-017,1298,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Like other sick bays, sick bays in preschools are temporary places to isolate unwell individuals before proper attention to their condition can be given. The provision of sick bays at preschools allows children to rest, while parents or guardians make arrangements to pick up their child and seek medical attention as needed. This practice helps to safeguard the health and safety of sick children, while minimising the risk of infection to other children in our preschools. This is all the more relevant in current times due to the high transmissibility of the COVID-19 virus."
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01299,2022-03-10-T-017,1299,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Keeping an unwell child in the sick bay for a prolonged period could affect the child, both in terms of physical comfort and also emotionally. Children in the sick bay must also be monitored closely by staff at all times, and preschools will have to redeploy staff from their primary duties to care for the sick child. This could compromise on the care and education for other children at the preschool."
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01300,2022-03-10-T-017,1300,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Preschool staff also do not have the relevant training to provide nursing care or attend to the medical needs of sick children on a prolonged basis. It is thus important for parents or guardians to pick up their sick children as soon as possible and ensure they receive the medical attention as required.
2022-03-10-T-017-S-01301,2022-03-10-T-017,1301,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nevertheless, we recognise the challenges working parents face during such situations. Each working parent of a Singaporean child below seven years old is eligible for six days of paid childcare leave per year. This is in addition to parents' annual leave provisions. Parents can tap on these leave provisions to bring their sick child to see a doctor and care for them at home subsequently. We urge employers to be empathetic and provide flexibility to their employees with young children during such exigencies. The Government will continue to work with tripartite partners to encourage and support employers to implement family-friendly measures, such as flexible work arrangements, so that working parents can balance their work alongside their family responsibilities."
2022-03-10-T-018-S-01302,2022-03-10-T-018,1302,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to date, whether any action has been brought under section 43 of the Environmental Public Health Act in respect of cases of secondhand smoke drifting from a person's home into a public corridor or public area; and (b) if not, why not."
2022-03-10-T-018-S-01303,2022-03-10-T-018,1303,Grace Fu Hai Yien,There have been no cases where action was taken under section 43 of the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) for second-hand smoke drifting from homes to public corridors or public areas.
2022-03-10-T-018-S-01304,2022-03-10-T-018,1304,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As explained in this House previously, section 43 of the EPHA comes under Part 5, which was enacted in the 1960s to provide for quick mitigative actions to arrest public nuisances from specific industrial activities. It is not the EPHA's purpose to deal with smoking prohibition."
2022-03-10-T-019-S-01305,2022-03-10-T-019,1305,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) in the past five years, what is the annual number of applications received under the financial schemes of the Community Development Councils; (b) what are the mean and median processing times of such assistance; (c) what are the mean and median cash amounts of such assistance; and (d) what is the success rate of such assistance."
2022-03-10-T-019-S-01306,2022-03-10-T-019,1306,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The number of beneficiaries helped by Community Development Councils (CDCs) has been increasing over the last five years. Over the last five years, the CDCs helped, on average, around 167,500 applications for financial assistance. On average, the processing of each case takes about two to three weeks, though cases for which urgent assistance is needed would have been expedited. The assistance provided in terms of cash quanta would be unique to the contextual factors in each case."
2022-03-10-T-020-S-01307,2022-03-10-T-020,1307,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Government will study the possibility of a pilot exercise to allow ex-offenders to obtain a security officer licence under strict rules that are made transparent.
2022-03-10-T-020-S-01308,2022-03-10-T-020,1308,K Shanmugam,"Security officers are often in positions of trust. They are entrusted with the duty to protect premises, property and persons."
2022-03-10-T-020-S-01309,2022-03-10-T-020,1309,K Shanmugam,"The Police make an assessment of all applicants. This will include considering their criminal records, if any. Having a criminal record will mean a much higher bar for the applicant. However, a criminal record is not an absolute bar. Police will look at the nature of the offence, as well as other relevant background. Ex-offenders have been granted licences."
2022-03-10-T-021-S-01310,2022-03-10-T-021,1310,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry systematically tracks the time between (i) a prison inmate lodging a medical complaint and receiving medical attention and (ii) an inmate seeking emergency medical attention and receiving such attention; and (b) what procedures are in place to ensure that inmates who seek medical attention and emergency medical attention get attended to promptly.
2022-03-10-T-021-S-01311,2022-03-10-T-021,1311,K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) works with its medical service provider to attend to inmates' medical needs. There are daily in-house clinics on weekdays and the prison doctor will attend to inmates who report sick. After office hours, on weekends and on public holidays, nurses and an on-call doctor are available."
2022-03-10-T-021-S-01312,2022-03-10-T-021,1312,K Shanmugam,"Inmates may also alert any prison officer at any time if they are feeling unwell, and they will be referred to medical staff for examination. While awaiting the arrival of medical personnel, inmates may also receive first aid and other medical attention from prison officers who are trained to provide such assistance. Inmates can raise with prison officers, if they have any issue with the medical help they are seeking."
2022-03-10-T-021-S-01313,2022-03-10-T-021,1313,K Shanmugam,"SPS tracks the medical service provider's response time, for medical emergencies."
2022-03-10-T-022-S-01314,2022-03-10-T-022,1314,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Education for each year in the past five years, how many teachers resigned in their first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth year of service respectively."
2022-03-10-T-022-S-01315,2022-03-10-T-022,1315,Chan Chun Sing,"Over the past five years, the average annual resignation rate of teachers in their first 10 years of service has remained low and stable, ranging between 2% and 3%, with very low rates in the first two years as newly-trained teachers have to serve a bond, a slightly higher resignation rate of 3% to 4% among teachers with around three to five years of service, before stabilising to about 2% for the more experienced teachers. In general, the teacher resignation rates are lower than other schemes in the Civil Service."
2022-03-10-T-023-S-01316,2022-03-10-T-023,1316,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the factors the Ministry considers in deciding whether a new Family Service Centre (FSC) should be set up to serve a given geographical area; and (b) what is the maximum number of equivalent dwelling units an FSC is expected to serve within a given geographical area.
2022-03-10-T-023-S-01317,2022-03-10-T-023,1317,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In deciding whether to set up new FSCs, the MSF projects caseloads based on factors, such as number of new dwelling units and dwelling unit types, for example, public rental flats, sold flats. We also consider the proximity of FSCs to residents."
2022-03-10-T-023-S-01318,2022-03-10-T-023,1318,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF does not impose a maximum number of dwelling units an FSC is expected to serve within its service area. Instead, we monitor caseloads of FSCs to ensure that they are manageable. MSF periodically reviews and may adjust the service boundaries of FSCs with higher caseloads."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01319,2022-03-10-T-024,1319,Ng Ling Ling,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development as more children and teachers in pre-schools are infected with COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant and the emergence of Omicron sub-variant BA.2 overseas (a) whether there will be a central pool of relief manpower under the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) that can provide help to affected pre-schools to tide through; and (b) how is the mental wellness of the pre-school teachers being monitored, given the increased workload to manage the rise in infection."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01320,2022-03-10-T-024,1320,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The surge in cases due to Omicron has affected many segments of society, and the preschool sector is no exception. ECDA recognises that a high number of COVID-19 cases amongst preschool staff can disrupt preschools' operations and has put in place several measures to support preschools in managing their operations"
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01321,2022-03-10-T-024,1321,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(a) More flexibility in manpower deployment  As all preschool staff are now fully vaccinated and are placed on weekly Rostered Routine Testing, each preschool may deploy staff across classes to deal with situations of manpower shortages, owing to staff who have been affected by COVID-19 or on medical leave. This is a relaxation of our earlier posture where the cross-deployment of staff within the preschool was restricted to minimise the risk of transmission. In areas where manpower is very tight, such as Mother Tongue Language teachers, staff may be deployed across preschools, subject to prevailing safe management measures. Preschools may also tap on relief staff who may now move across preschools to alleviate some of the manpower shortage."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01322,2022-03-10-T-024,1322,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(b) Flexibility in regulatory requirements  In situations where preschools are impacted by substantial staff absenteeism, ECDA works closely with the operators to initiate their business continuity plan, such as adjusting programme plans and allowing flexibility in staffing ratios."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01323,2022-03-10-T-024,1323,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(c) Streamlined processes  ECDA and the MOH have streamlined the contact tracing process to empower preschools with greater autonomy and make it easier for them to manage COVID-19 cases. For example, we have streamlined the process to allow preschools to submit details of close contacts directly to MOH, so that Health Risk Notices can be issued faster, thereby reducing the period of uncertainty for parents and staff."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01324,2022-03-10-T-024,1324,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Should preschools require additional manpower, they can source for relief manpower services on EzMart, a portal hosted by the Association of Early Childhood and Training Services' (ASSETS). Preschool operators may also source through Human Resource agencies or tap on their own pool of relief staff, such as former staff, who would be familiar with the preschool's operations and children."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01325,2022-03-10-T-024,1325,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To support the physical and mental well-being of staff, preschools are encouraged to monitor their staff's stress levels, consider balancing and rotating staff's responsibilities and administrative duties, provide sufficient rest breaks at reasonable intervals, as well as offer channels of support. We recognise that it may be challenging for preschools to do so where manpower is very tight. Nonetheless, we encourage preschools to press on with their efforts to shore up staff's physical and mental well-being. Preschools can tap on support provided by the Health Promotion Board, including health screening, health coaching, as well as health talks and workshops tailored for educators, covering topics, such as mental wellness."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01326,2022-03-10-T-024,1326,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We recognise that preschool staff have been working tirelessly since the start of the pandemic, to ensure that our children remain safe. To appreciate their contribution towards our national efforts to fight COVID-19, and in conjunction with the Early Childhood Conference 2021, ECDA distributed care packs to all preschool staff. In addition, as part of Teachers' Day celebrations last year, the Association for Early Childhood Educators Singapore (AECES) and Preschool Market also organised a ground-up initiative known as Special Treats, where preschool educators received sponsored gift items, promotions and complimentary self-care and wellness workshops to encourage them to take time for self-care."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01327,2022-03-10-T-024,1327,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ECDA will continue to work with operators to improve the well-being of preschool staff, in line with the Government's continued efforts to uplift the Early Childhood sector."
2022-03-10-T-024-S-01328,2022-03-10-T-024,1328,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As keeping our preschools safe and healthy is a collective effort, we encourage parents to support our preschool staff by playing their part to monitor closely their children's health. Children who are unwell should stay at home to rest, consult a primary care doctor if needed, and return to preschool only when they have fully recovered. We also encourage parents whose children are five years old and older and medically eligible, to register them for COVID-19 vaccination to give them better protection."
2022-03-10-T-025-S-01329,2022-03-10-T-025,1329,Ng Ling Ling,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to parents securing a place for their newly diagnosed special needs children in a Government-funded Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children run by charitable social service agencies (a) whether there is any change in the average waiting time of six months for enrolment; and (b) what is the difference in the average waiting time and out-of-pocket fees when these parents opt for the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers instead.
2022-03-10-T-025-S-01330,2022-03-10-T-025,1330,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For children who have been enrolled in an early intervention (EI) centre for the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC), the average waiting time from referral to enrolment is, currently, seven months, up from six months in 2020. However, waiting time varies across EI centres and regions, depending on demand."
2022-03-10-T-025-S-01331,2022-03-10-T-025,1331,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The increase in waiting time can be attributed to an increase in hospital referrals to Government-funded EI centres and the impact of COVID-19 and safe management measures (SMMs) over the past two years. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has been regularly reviewing the SMMs to enable EI centres to support more children.
2022-03-10-T-025-S-01332,2022-03-10-T-025,1332,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) programme, provided by ECDA-appointed private EI centres, serves as a complement to EIPIC run by Social Service Agencies (SSA). Among PPIP centres which maintained a wait list, the wait time to enrol in the programme ranged from four months to 12 months in 2021."
2022-03-10-T-025-S-01333,2022-03-10-T-025,1333,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses, that is, net fee payable by parents after Government subsidies under the PPIP programme are, generally, higher than that of EIPIC. This is because MSF provides SSA-run EI centres with additional funding to keep fees affordable. The exact difference in OOP expenses depends on the EIPIC and PPIP programme fees charged by centres and the subsidy tier the child is eligible for."
2022-03-10-T-025-S-01334,2022-03-10-T-025,1334,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, after subsidies, a middle-income family will pay about $200 more per month for a PPIP programme than for a similar EIPIC programme, assuming the median fees charged for both these programmes. The Mediacorp Enable Fund, administered by SG Enable, will provide some support for needy families which have difficulties covering the OOP expenses."
2022-03-10-T-026-S-01335,2022-03-10-T-026,1335,Ng Ling Ling,"asked the Minister for Health in view of the continued surge of COVID-19 infections due to the Omicron variant and the emergence of Omicron sub-variant BA.2 overseas (a) whether the Ministry has data on the increase in daily volume of patient visits to the polyclinics and the Public Health Preparedness Clinics in the past month; (b) if so, what is the data; (c) what is the expected volume for the next three months; and (d) what relief for manpower can these clinics tap on when short-handed."
2022-03-10-T-026-S-01336,2022-03-10-T-026,1336,Ong Ye Kung,"Given that primary care is the first line of care, we have observed a 140% increase in daily average attendances due to Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) at the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics from 9,100 in January 2022 to 21,810 in February 2022. However, as the Omicron wave wanes, which it will, the cases will fall."
2022-03-10-T-026-S-01337,2022-03-10-T-026,1337,Ong Ye Kung,"To support the primary care sector, MOH provides grants, enables test centres to certify infections, and has been encouraging those who experience mild or no symptoms to recover at home."
