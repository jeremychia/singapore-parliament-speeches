2022-03-11-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Louis Ng had asked a similar question at the Committee of Supply in 2020. As MOF explained then, all Singaporean children receive substantial benefits that support their growth and development from the Government, regardless of their parents’ marital status. These include  (a) Child Development Account benefits, including the $3,000 First Step Grant and matched co-savings from Government; (b) $4,000 in MediSave Grant for Newborns; (c) MediShield Life coverage from birth; (d) over $180,000 of education subsidies by the time they turn 16 years old, including pre-school subsidies; and (e) Government healthcare subsidies.",1,5,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00005

2022-03-11-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Working Mother’s Child Relief and Parenthood Tax Rebate were instituted to encourage women to continue working after their marriage and childbirth, and to support parenthood within marriage and should be seen in that context.

2022-03-11-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir, and I thank the Second Minister for the reply. Could I just check if a single unwed mother gets married to the father of the child, subsequently gets a divorce, will she then qualify for the Parenthood Tax Rebate and the Working Mother's Child Relief?",1,11,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00011
2022-03-11-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, I am just hoping again. I have raised this quite a few times now, but I am hoping that MOF looks at this not just from a tax dollar perspective, but from the perspective of whether our policies can result in a more inclusive society. The Minister and I were at the dialogue with single unweds, where they spoke in tears about the stigma they face. So, I hope again that we can change our policies. When the Minister was a backbencher, here, in this House, 16 years ago, she spoke about the concerns, about how single unwed mothers do not feel like they are included in our society.",2,12,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00012
2022-03-11-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I hope MOF will review this again and include single unwed mothers and father in our Parenthood Tax rebate and the Working Mother's Child Relief for the mothers.,3,13,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00013
2022-03-11-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his clarification or supplementary questions and I commend him for his concern for vulnerable single mothers. I would say this  we too are committed to supporting single mothers. In terms of specific tax measures and how they operate, it is important to remember that certain tax measures were designed originally with a certain social objective. We must be careful not to just transplant or think that a measure that is for one social objective can just be transplanted or extended to meet another social objective.",1,14,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00014
2022-03-11-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I think what I can say is this  we will do our best to ensure that single mothers are supported. I am happy to note that the situation now is, in fact, much better than it was 16 years ago when I spoke about this. And we will continue to make it better for them, without, hopefully, distorting the lines too much in terms of where our society feels comfortable in terms of societal values.",2,15,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00015
2022-03-11-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I think the takeaway the Member should have is that we will not forget single mothers, working or otherwise. We will make sure that the child is definitely given every opportunity to be supported and we will support the mothers as well.",3,16,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00016
2022-03-11-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The specific question that the Member had about the application of the measures, I will check that and we will respond to him. I just want to make sure that the response that is given is accurate.",4,17,2022-03-11-T-001-S-00017

2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister of Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, last month, I shared with this House that the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has extended the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme (TRECS) from March till May 2022. Thus far, participating generation companies and retailers have been providing sufficient TRECS and retail contracts with significant fixed price components to meet demand, on a voluntary basis.",1,23,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00023
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister of Trade and Industry),"To ensure that electricity retailers do not impose unfair contractual terms on consumers under TRECS, EMA has worked directly with retailers to ensure that contractual terms such as prices and security deposit requirements are reasonably set. All electricity retailers must comply with the Code of Conduct for Retail Electricity Licensees, called the Code. EMA will not hesitate to investigate and take action against any non-compliance with the Code.",2,24,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00024
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister of Trade and Industry),"TRECS are one-month contracts. For consumers who want greater certainty, we are also working with generation companies and electricity retailers to offer longer-term, fixed price contracts to consumers who wish to have more price stability. For example, retailers such as Keppel Electric and Sembcorp Power are currently offering longer-term electricity contracts ranging from six-months to three years. Eligible consumers without a retail plan may wish to consider such contracts for greater price certainty.",3,25,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00025

2022-03-11-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. I would like to ask the Ministry to clarify whether there is a limit to the amount that generating companies (gencos) can draw on EMA's standby fuel facilities for TRECS. Two, are gencos entitled to draw on EMA standby fuel facilities if they are not participating in TRECS?",1,28,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00028
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Yip for his supplementary question. There is no limit to the amount that can be drawn down for TRECS.

2022-03-11-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Sir, one business in my constituency recently sought my help and they informed me that they were unable to sign up for TRECS contracts in March, despite applying on 15 February, which it the day that the contracting window opened. They told me that it was fully subscribed that very day. Can I confirm with the Minister, was TRECS fully subscribed for the month of Februrary and if so, how many businesses had to be turned away? Are there plans to increase capacity for TRECS in the months of April and May, given the over-subscription in the month of March?",1,31,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00031
2022-03-11-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Lastly, taking into account the current global situation and over-subscribed TRECS, what measures has EMA planned to enhance Singapore's energy security and stabilise Singapore's wholesale electricity market?",2,32,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00032
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Giam for his three supplementary questions. First, if he could get the resident or perhaps Mr Giam himself can write to me, I would be happy to investigate further. Earlier on, I did share in this House that there were 200 megawatts of contracts available for TRECS for February. As of 28 February 2022, there were at least 300 megawatts of contracts that were still available. For his resident who could not get access to the contract, as far as TRECS is concerned, I think there is a bit of a mismatch.",1,33,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00033
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Moving forward, we have monitored it on a very tight basis. Not only do we ensure that we have sufficient capacity as far as TRECS is concerned for the months of March, April and May, EMA has also been negotiating with other gencos to provide for fixed price contracts, on a longer-term basis, between three month and three years, as I shared in my earlier reply to Mr Yip Hon Weng. One of them is Keppel Electric and the other one is SembCorp Power.",2,34,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00034
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Moving forward, in terms of ensuring our energy supplies and energy security, the fact is that there are further plans that are afoot. At this point in time, I am not ready to share these plans as yet. In terms of looking at our standby facilities, in terms of negotiations with imports and so on, our entire team is on it.",3,35,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00035
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the extent to which we can share, so long as it does not compromise our ability to negotiate these contractual terms, at this point in time, it suffices for me to say that the entire energy team is working on a whole slew of measures to ensure that we do not get any disruptions in our energy supplies.",4,36,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00036

2022-03-11-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, I just have a very short supplementary question. Would the Ministry consider making participation in TRECS mandatory for all gencos?",1,38,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00038
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Yip for his suggestion. As the name represents, it is a temporary situation; it is a temporary retail electricity contract scheme. We have made it voluntary because the nature of the generation of electrons is that if you require them to generate the electrons, if there is excess electrons, it gets wasted. Pairing is quite important. You have on the one hand, companies who want to have some form of stability. But there are also concerns about the high prices. TRECS is a short-term measure. What we need is a further, longer-term measure, which EMA has worked on pari passu, in terms of supporting.",1,39,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00039
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Hence, we are quite comforted by the fact that two other gencos, gen retailers have stepped forth to offer longer-term fixed price contracts, ranging from six months to three years, to offer some form of price certainty.",2,40,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00040
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The challenge is that today, TRECS offer the flexibility of a one-month contract, which allows companies to hedge for that one month. Because the prices are quite high today, if they lock themselves for a long term, and if the price should ease off after that, then, it would be very difficult for them to justify that increased cost, moving forward.",3,41,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00041
2022-03-11-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Given the volatility that the current situation, the whole world is in today, with a lot of fluctuations happening, I think this is a more nuanced approach. It allows responsiveness and the ability to nimbly work in terms of managing their costs, at least on a month-to-month basis, should the stability return to the market.",4,42,2022-03-11-T-003-S-00042

2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"With this Budget, we will be strengthening our business ecosystem and building stronger Singaporean enterprises. The ""Singapore Global Enterprises"" and the ""Singapore Global Executive Programme"" will help us produce companies and Singaporean talent that are globally competitive. Budget 2022 will also revitalise and support our F&B, retail and tourism sectors. We will continue to press on with our digitalisation journey, while ensuring those less comfortable with technology are not be sidelined.",11,72,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00072
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"This Budget affirms our support for our workers, especially low-wage workers. The Progressive Wage Model, Progressive Wage Credit Scheme and enhancement of the workfare income supplement scheme will support and uplift our lower-wage workers. This unique approach is the outcome of intensive effort between the Tripartite partners  the Labour movement, employers and Government.",12,73,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00073
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We can now continue to develop a strong and skilled Singaporean workforce while enabling employers to meet genuine manpower needs by hiring foreigners with relevant skills to complement our local workforce, through the increases in the minimum qualifying salaries for work passes and the COMPASS points-based framework.",13,74,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00074
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We are speeding up our transition to a greener, more sustainable society with the review of our climate plan and the setting of more ambitious goals, the increase in carbon tax, R&D into sustainability, cutting emissions, energy efficiency, renewable and clean energy and zero-waste. As this is not without trade-offs and costs, Singaporeans will be engaged in this endeavour so that we can all have a clear understanding of what it will take to achieve our green ambitions even as we move forward on them.",14,75,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00075
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We have renewed and strengthened our social compact. Cost of living, inflation are very much on people's minds. Almost all Members spoke on this in one way or another. Approving the Household Support Package and other help schemes paves the way for us to help Singaporeans through this tough period. We heard assurance from the Minister for Finance during his round-up speech that the Government would ""not hesitate to take further actions to protect jobs, and to help households and businesses deal with increased costs, if need be.""",15,76,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00076
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We have ensured we can meet and pay for the healthcare needs of our rapidly ageing population. With Healthier SG we have the blueprint for a new model of healthcare of the future, anchored on prevention as well as cure.",16,77,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00077
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We have continued our educational reforms, reducing pressure and stress so our children can focus on the joy of learning – mid-year examinations for all Primary and Secondary levels will be removed by 2023 and streaming would be removed fully 2024.",17,78,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00078
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),We are redoubling our efforts to bridge inequality and make sure no one is left behind. Social service delivery will be improved. ComLink will be scaled up nationwide and UPLIFT expanded. There will be more opportunities for the differently abled.,18,79,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00079
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),We reaffirmed the importance of family – 2022 will be the year of celebrating families and strengthening support for families.,19,80,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00080
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"All these good things cannot come to pass without funding. To enable them to happen, we enhanced and strengthened our tax structure. We will adjust the corporate tax system to take into account BEPS. We increased the progressivity of our personal income tax. We raised wealth taxes through targeted increases in property tax and tax on luxury cars. And we increased GST with a significant package to buffer its impact and adjusted the timing.",20,81,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00081
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Most Singaporeans will not feel the impact of the GST increase for many years because of the support measures we designed. By coupling GST with GSTV, we ensure that the lower-income, including many retirees, will continue to pay less GST than the headline rate. We will study further support if the inflation situation worsens.",21,82,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00082
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"And in Parliament, the Budget process saw robust debate. The value of robust debate is that it helps to crystalise the issues and it lets people see where Members of Parliament and Parties stand. And I thought it might be helpful here if I just summarise the difference in approach between the Government and the Opposition, in particular, the Workers' Party, not to reignite the whole debate on this again. But just to summarise what the different philosophical approaches are, so that people can look at it and make their own judgements and determination.",22,83,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00083
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"On the Government side, the structures that we have put in place are ones we believe are fair and progressive. There is GST; yes, but will not hurt the low-income because of Permanent GST Voucher scheme, and the Assurance Package will help all Singaporean households, not just the lower-income cope with the transition, and the GST Voucher scheme provides permanent assistance.",23,84,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00084
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Everyone contributes, but those who have more, contribute more. Those with less also contribute but a lesser amount and receive more in return. Keeping the tax burden manageable for all, including businesses so that there is incentive for all to work hard, do well and enjoy the benefits of their hard work even as they contribute to our revenues.",24,85,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00085
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We still maintain the protection of our reserves and we use the income on our reserves equitably – 50% for this generation, 50% for the next.",25,86,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00086
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Workers' Party has a different philosophical approach. They have preferred not not to raise GST. But I do not think there is any dispute that there is a genuine and real need though to fund healthcare, going forward and that there is a need for increased revenue. To achieve additional revenue of $3.5 billion a year, the net effect of their various proposals is to tax large companies more, tax the rich or use more of the reserves. No matter which way you cut it, it boils down to those three things  tax companies more, tax the rich more, or use more of the reserves.",26,87,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00087
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"From our perspective, it is too early to adjust corporate taxes as it will depend on the evolving rules for BEPS 2.0. And even if we are able to collect more in corporate taxes from the revenues from BEPS 2.0, we will have to use these revenues for additional measures to enhance our overall competitiveness and ensure that we can continue to attract our fair share of investments.",27,88,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00088
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"On taxing the rich, there are ramifications on whether we will drive away talent and wealth, and that will be bad for Singaporeans. In reality, wealth is mobile, higher taxes on a small group of people at the top who are extremely mobile will eventually lead to higher taxes for upper middle-income or even middle-income groups.",28,89,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00089
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),Using more of the reserves means leaving less behind for the next generation and imposing higher taxes on them.,29,90,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00090
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So, I just lay this out at the end of the day, so that people can reflect, make their own conclusions and see how they wish to view this. But I thought when all was said and done, and the dust settled after the debate, it is good just to crystallise the two different positions, so that people will have a more meaningful insight as to what the different propositions actually mean.",30,91,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00091
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Next, with more Opposition Members in Parliament, it is natural that our debates will get more robust. That is par for the course. However, in this session, we are also reminded that whilst robust debate is good, it is also important that Members maintain decorum in their actions, both in and outside of the House.",31,92,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00092
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Standing Orders are there for a reason. Timelines and deadlines are also there for a reason – to enable us to conduct parliamentary business efficiently but also effectively. I, therefore, urge Members to be mindful of this, so that for future debates, we can have all the cut and thrust that we desire but, at the same time, observing all due proprieties.",32,93,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00093

It has been a tiring but rewarding two weeks.",33,94,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00094
2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Budget was the product of strong input from Singaporeans from all walks of life; we engaged widely, took in feedback.

2022-03-11-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I would also like to express my gratitude to all of the public servants who have been working so hard on this, on top of their regular work. Many have had to learn on the job, some have taken on additional ""COVID-fighting"" roles over the past two years or so, and then have had to deal with Budget. It has been a tiring time for them but they soldier on, because when they signed up for Public Service, they knew they also signed up to serve, even at personal cost in terms of family time and rest.",35,96,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00096

2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"It is very challenging. Every year, the night before, or two nights before, barely any sleep because you are trying to distil the last one and a half to two weeks’ worth of discussions, discourse, and all the work done into a “Too Long Didn’t Read” (TLDR) version. It is really difficult. People often say, “Government communications cannot make it! Why is it so complicated? Why can’t you keep it simple?”",2,100,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00100
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I can tell you that Government is trying.

Even as we deal with the economic ramifications of this pandemic that has stricken every nation on earth and affected everyone, we are now caught in the grips of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It may seem remote, but we are all feeling the impact immediately, with petrol prices going up. We worry about inflation. Inflation was a worry even before this conflict. If the West were to suspend purchase of Russian oil and gas, what would that impact be on energy prices and on cost of living? This was a recurrent theme that many of you have raised.",14,112,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00112
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"We have been jittery for some time because we are living in a fast-changing world. We are living amidst a Fourth Industrial Revolution. We are concerned about things changing as our children go to school and universities, and by the time they graduate, is the world going to move on, is it going to be relevant? We are concerned about the geopolitical implications of the clash between the US and China, and how we are caught up in between them. We are worried about demographic trends in Singapore – by 2030, one in four of us will be 65 and above. What does that mean? Will we lose our verve as an economy? Is that going to affect our jobs? And with that longevity, lower birth rates, the burden on healthcare costs? And we worry also about the climate and how is it going to change and affect us, and especially our children’s generation?",15,113,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00113

2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The world we live in is also – and many of you would be familiar with this term – a Post-Truth World, whatever that definition might be. We might have different perceptions of it. But essentially, these days, truth might seem indeterminant, malleable. After all, who determines the “truth”? Does Parliament determine the truth? Do you determine the truth? Does the Government determine the truth? Do facts and evidence matter? Or is truth determined by “Well, this is what I believe, what I feel, what I hear”, and therefore it becomes the “truth”? Is it based on whoever says it loudest? Whoever says it more passionately, eloquently, or more coolly? But that is the world we live in.",18,116,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00116

You can go to a rental flat and some of you who are involved in the work will realise when you come to a flat, it is messy, a lot of stuff that is there. And the smell of stale sweat, urine. And you feel, how on earth can Singaporeans live in such abject poverty in First World Singapore? How have we failed them? How society has failed them. How Government has failed them.",21,119,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00119

2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"For those of us involved in the work, you will know that sometimes, it is because of mental health issues, because of hoarding; sometimes, because of mobility issues – the individuals are not able to upkeep the flats. Whose responsibility would it be? Individuals? Do we then not ask, where is the family in the overall scheme of things? Where are the neighbours? Where is the community? And the Government has a role to play.",24,122,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00122
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"But this is how stories can manifest themselves in many, many different ways. We are living in a world where we have more information than ever before. In fact, information is increasing at exponential rates. But we are not necessarily better informed. We are, like I said earlier, the TLDR generation. If it takes a few more swipes left or right, up or down, it just takes too much time, it is just too tedious.",25,123,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00123

We have so much to distract us  Netflix, Minecraft, K-Drama, and some of you have been playing Wordle or Quordle, which is even worse! The list goes on and on. Many of us are better educated, more critically minded. But if we ask ourselves honestly, how many of us actually read? Or do we just scan? And because we are kind of smart and we have opinions and views about things, do we formulate those opinions very quickly? Or are we just too busy with all the different things distracting us? We go to certain commentators for their distillation of the issues of the day rather than just reading it ourselves. We have “live” broadcast of Parliament today, but how many of us actually go to the source and actually listen to what was said? Or do we listen to what is being said by others? Do we fact-check?",26,124,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00124

I am less cultured than he is, so I can only share from a book that I find quite telling, “Factfulness” by Hans Rosling. While some might criticise Rosling for being overly positive, my main takeaway is that, as human beings, our nature, are we sometimes not really very evidence-based? We are very much driven by emotions. That is why stories are so powerful. We have this instinct to be negative, “Oh, the world is a lot worse than it is today”. But is it really? We tend to blame, we like to generalise and so on. It distorts the way we look at things.",28,126,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00126
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"When we look at the combination of these different things in the world that we are living in today, it has real implications. We see around the world today, for example, the divisions and the polarisation of American society. And I believe that even the storming of Capitol Hill is arguably a physical and violent manifestation of that. BREXIT also happened on the back of a number of fraudulent claims by political leaders. It is a monumental decision. We wish them well. But there are real-life implications to how all these things play themselves out.",29,127,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00127
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The important question for all of us as leaders in this Parliament, in this environment, is to realise that this playbook, sadly, actually works. Which is why you see many politicians using it. The rise of the far-right or even the far-left are examples of that. Playing the anti-foreigner card. We see that happening the world over. Race and religion is an easy game to play because it is so primordial in every society. Do we play fast and loose with the stories we use? Do we just lift “facts” from chat groups, or wherever it might be? Do we use anecdotes recounted to us without checking whether it is true? Do we verify? Or is it a case of what I believe is true and therefore, it is? Also, in this world where we are all politically correct, are we just too shy, too scared to take a stand, lest we be accused of being closed-minded, being cancelled out on social media?",30,128,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00128
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"It is happening around the world. This is a reality of the world – it is not going to go away. I think it is just going to get worse, if you will. But the important question both for us as Members of Parliament and Singaporeans at large is what do we do with that? And especially for us in this Chamber, how do we then carry out our roles? Do we exploit these gaps and these trends? Or do we rise above it and take a different course?",31,129,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00129

To erode trust. What happens then? Do we end up being no different from any Internet forum? That is something all of us need to decide. We need to ask ourselves, is it creeping into our own political discourse?",32,130,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00130

Many of them, apart from creating policies, are also at the frontlines because they need to double up, because there are other responsibilities. Dr Tan Yia Swam, Dr Wan Rizal and Dr Janil have talked about being understanding to our healthcare workers. I think it is worth reminding us to bear in mind to treat all our public officers with decency and respect. They are doing their best. No one is perfect. There will be those who fall afoul of what we would expect of them. But for the vast majority of them, they are doing their best to look after all of us. It behooves us to at least accord them that basic dignity and respect.",35,133,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00133
2022-03-11-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I remember during the debate on public housing a few days ago, I was quite struck by it. We were discussing about waiting times for HDB flats, eligibility ages, about housing in prime locations, about EIP concerns. Of course, there are areas to improve and there are concerns that we need to assuage. But I am also reminded by my many residents who come to me to tell me that they are going off, some of them getting married, forming new families, they email me, they message me. As we are talking about the different things to improve on, many of our foreign visitors, as you talk to them, are remarkably impressed about our public housing policies  80 % of Singaporeans live in public housing; 73% – like many of my residents, they are not high-income Singaporeans, they are middle-, lower-middle Singaporeans – 73% of them service their loans with CPF, with no cash outlay. For low-income families, I have a number of rental blocks as well, we have, in total, about 4,500 families in the last five years who have gained home ownership.

Many more of his colleagues might have lost their jobs. And in many indirect ways, he has benefited too. I am glad that he acknowledged that. Many of my residents share the same, whether they are running big businesses, small businesses, many of them having jobs in management positions, they are glad that the policies that all of you have created have helped.",37,135,2022-03-11-T-006-S-00135

In January, our unemployment rate is 3.1%, and it is close to back where it was pre-COVID-19 times. Real income has moved, especially at the lower income level.

In my view, it is completely politically naïve to talk about balanced Budget, to talk about tax increases when you have reserves. I do not know what the reserves comprise. Temasek and MAS, we know. And GIC, I am not even going to ask Minister Lawrence what the amount is, but we keep it confidential for strategic reasons. But we do have a fair bit of reserves. And we have seen how that came into play in the last few years. Should the situation arise in the coming years, I have no doubt that MOF would step in and do what needs to be done.

New variants and new waves remain a possibility – it is quite a natural thing that viruses continue to evolve and mutate over time, as we have seen with previous variants. When such cases and events happen and whether they affect disease transmission and severity, cannot be predicted ahead of time.

They ask how is this endemic living if we continue to live with these nationwide restrictions that impact social well-being and businesses? I am not suggesting that we do away with the measures. But I hope the Ministry can and will introduce more certainty.

Even some young patrons have trouble making sense of them, let alone seniors.

That said, the fact that COVID-19 is spreading widely through our population, even with such high vaccination rates, should lead us to continue to review whether the control measures we currently have in place remain fit for purpose.

Members of the House, however, have also sought clarifications on some issues and allow me to take the House through some of them.",1,182,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00182
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how we can do more to encourage persons who are sceptical of the mRNA vaccines to take up vaccination to protect themselves. As previously highlighted in Parliament, the Novavax Nuvaxovid vaccine has been authorised by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and recommended by the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination for use under our National Vaccination Programme, as an alternative to the mRNA vaccines.",2,183,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00183
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The first batch of Nuvaxovid vaccine is expected to arrive sometime in the months ahead, barring any shipment delays. This will provide those who may have hesitancy receiving the mRNA vaccine an alternative and I hope they do take this seriously and consider getting themselves vaccinated. Even though Omicron causes less severe disease than the Delta strain, during this recent Omicron wave, the 3% of adults who were partially or unvaccinated contributed to 20% of our ICU cases, occupied two-thirds of our ICU beds and caused about 30% or so of the mortality that we see.",3,184,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00184

2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"COVID-19 therapeutics were mentioned by Ms Sylvia Lim and, indeed, they have been authorised by HSA. But I must explain that they are meant to mitigate the risk of progression to severe illnesses from COVID-19 infection. Whereas vaccination serves as a more preventive role, that goes further upstream to prevent COVID-19 infection and not allow severe illnesses to take place in the first place. Therapeutics are, therefore, complementary and not substitutes for vaccination.",5,186,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00186
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Let me share some data, which are actually quite compelling.

In fact, as explained, this rationalisation is, itself, a way to simplify the SMMs into just five key parameters. It makes it easier for the public to understand and, in the coming weeks, as we see the cases continue to show a sustained decline, we can then further ease measures along these key parameters.",9,190,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00190

Ms Sylvia Lim also mentioned that the control measures should be constantly reviewed and make sure that they are fit for purpose. I agree with her.

2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As mentioned in my opening speech, we take a calibrated approach in the control measures and have made progressive adjustments to the SMMs as the COVID-19 situation evolves. Members will certainly recall, when the pandemic first started, we actually went into a circuit breaker and, subsequently, a series of Heightened Alert phases, as we cautiously, gradually, tried to reopen social and economic activities to manage the infection risk in our largely unvaccinated population at that time.",13,194,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00194
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"With good progress in our national vaccination efforts towards the end of 2021, our collective resilience and immunity and defence against the virus were strengthened.

2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"When this current Omicron wave hit us, our population had achieved a high vaccination and booster rate, allowing us to then continue on with our progressive reopening and our move towards endemicity, without further tightening of restrictions.",15,196,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00196
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,Such a move would have been unthinkable one-and-a-half years ago and our healthcare system at that time could well have been overwhelmed if the same numbers of daily infections were to be seen at that point.,16,197,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00197
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, this clearly attests to the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines and the trust and unity of our people in responding to the call to get vaccinated and boosted. Our adjustments to Protocols 123 and the maintenance of some SMMs have allowed us to ride through this wave currently without causing our healthcare system to collapse.",17,198,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00198
2022-03-11-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Like Members, I, too, hope that we can eventually dispense with the restrictions. In a best-case scenario when COVID-19 ceases to be a threat before the end of 12 months, regulations that are no longer relevant can be repealed and Part 7 can be allowed to lapse. In the opposite scenario, if a variant that can cause more severe illness takes hold, the regulations under Part 7 will continue to be important for the protection of public health.",18,199,2022-03-11-T-007-S-00199

2022-03-11-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is on the implementation of exclusion orders. Currently, three categories of individuals are prohibited from entering casinos, entering fruit machine rooms in private clubs and opening a Singapore Pools' online gambling account. These three categories are undischarged bankrupts, Public Rental Scheme tenants with six or more months of rent arrears and individuals on Government social assistance and subsidy schemes. These are individuals subject to an ""Exclusion by Law"".",2,285,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00285

This extension will significantly expand the number of persons subject to exclusion orders. However, presently the Exclusion by Law operates without notification being given to the individuals subject to the exclusion order. Given that a significant number of new individuals will be subject to the Exclusion of Law come 1 June 2022, can Minister share how he will ensure that appropriate notice is given to individuals newly categorised as excluded persons?",3,286,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00286

2022-03-11-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on inducing an underaged individual to gamble. Under the new section 34, it would be an offence to send an underaged individual an inducement to gamble. The exception is when the accused proves that they did not receive any benefit for sending the inducement and the inducement was not sent in the cause of any business.

2022-03-11-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition, can Minister clarify why the exception appears to be limited to cases where the inducer actually receives the benefits? One can imagine situations where the inducer is meant to receive some form of benefit from inducing the underaged individual to gamble, but for whatever reasons, the benefit fails to materialise. Why should the inducer's bad luck, in failing to receive the benefit, be their good luck, in managing to avoid an offence under section 34?",7,290,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00290
2022-03-11-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final point relates to the grounds for entry bans. The Commissioner for Police may impose entry bans on an individual if they deem that the individual's criminal history will present an unacceptable risk to maintaining proper standards of integrity of any gambling service. The Agency can also impose an entry ban on the basis that the standards of integrity are likely to be prejudiced by the individual's character, reputation or criminal activities.",8,291,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00291

Two casinos were opened in 2010 and in 2019, the Government raised the cap on the number of slot machines allowed and increased the floorspace allocated to gambling.

This remains a concern, as according to the NCPG survey, 23% of gamblers who participated in sports gambling reported poor self-control.",3,299,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00299
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"With this in mind, I would like to sound a note of caution about any further expansion of the space for gambling in Singapore. Social gambling is not disallowed by current legislation. This Bill explicitly legalises social gambling in Singapore. On one hand, the Government has said that in the past, the law can and should reflect social norms and attitudes. As a matter of logical consistency then, should the Government not be cautious about making social gambling explicitly legal, so as to avoid being seen as issuing an official stamp of approval for gambling?",4,300,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00300

May I ask the Minister of State, why there will be no restrictions on minors engaging in social gambling? I hope this does not mean the Government condones gambling by minors. How does the Government intend to communicate to children, adolescents and their parents that it discourages gambling by minors? I am also concerned how explicitly permitting gambling for children could provide a gateway for more problem gambling habits later in their lives.",6,302,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00302
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Current policy to prevent gambling by minors is inconsistent. While the minimum age is set at 18 for certain types of gambling, such as 4D, Toto or placing horse racing bets, it is set at 21 for casino gambling. In recent years, the Government has raised the minimum smokeing age from 18 to 21, so as to denormalise the use of cigarettes among adolescent youths, especially since most cultivate the habit between the ages of 18 and 21.",7,303,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00303

With this evidence in mind, can MHA consider taking the same approach as with smoking and harmonise the minimum gambling age to 21 across the board? This could ameliorate the pernicious effects of gambling on not just young people but also on their families and society.",8,304,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00304
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I would now like to discuss the particularly challenging issue with respect to combatting gambling by minors, which is loot boxes. Loot boxes are virtual items within games that can be purchased and redeemed to receive another random desirable virtual item. Gaming companies have been pushing loot boxes in their games, especially in mobile games, leading to increased gaming spending and debt. Many consumers of loot boxes are children. Research from the UK has found that of the 93% of children who play video games, 25% to 40% have made loot box purchases. Other research has found consistently and unambiguously a link between loot boxes and problem gambling.",9,305,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00305
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"This being so, I would like to ask the Minister of State as to how the Gambling Control Bill intends to regulate loot boxes in online games. Clause 9 of the Gambling Control Bill defines a lottery as a scheme to distribute prizes based on luck and prizes here refer to money, or money equivalents or anything of value. Can I ask the Minister of State whether the Gambling Control Bill considers such virtual rewards to be things of value, even when they cannot be monetised, such that operating any loot box system would be considered operating a lottery? If so, what will the regulatory regime for online game operators be like?",10,306,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00306
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Several other countries have already sought to regulate or restrict loot boxes in online games. Belgium's gaming commission has declared loot boxes to be gambling and hence, illegal. The Netherlands' gaming authority issues a legal opinion that some loot box system contravene the Dutch betting and gambling act, hence, requiring the relevant game developers to change their mechanics or face fines or even game prohibition. In Asia, China has imposed daily limits on the number of purchased loot boxes that a player can open, while Japan has banned complete gacha, which is a system that offers rare prizes to players who successfully obtain a complete set of items through random draws.",11,307,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00307

2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I have spoken of law and policy thus far, but no amount of regulations and restrictions will be able to completely eliminate gambling activities in Singapore. In fact, one argument against prohibition is that it might drive gambling activities underground. We therefore need active educational efforts to discourage gambling among our population. With the introduction of the Gambling Control Bill, will there be greater educational efforts to discourage Singaporeans, particularly young people, from participating in gambling activities and delaying their first gambling experience?",13,309,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00309
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I am glad to know that schools have since 2021 been trying to teach students about the ills of loot boxes. I would urge MOE to continue to assess the efficacy of such programmes. Have such educational efforts been found to genuinely reduce loot box use among youths? And if not, how can such outreach be improved?",14,310,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00310
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I understand that many Singaporeans gamble on occasion. However, the risk of problem and pathological gambling and its often accompanying financial ruin, is very real. On balance, the job of public policy in the area of gambling is to maintain moderation. To allow responsible adults to take part in this activity, but not so much that they ruin themselves and to discourage impressionable children from taking up the habit in the first place.",15,311,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00311
2022-03-11-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In summary, I would like to call on the Government to reassess its position on social gambling and to take a strong stand against gambling by children, especially in the area of loot boxes. We should complement policy levers with better education against gambling. More generally, I call on Parliament to take a stronger stance against gambling. I hope the Minister of State will be able to address the concerns I have raised in the Bills, but not withstanding these concerns. I support the Bills.",16,312,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00312

I have also raised concerns about the issue of problem gambling and of dedicating additional resources towards gambling safeguards and rehabilitation of problem gamblers. Pertinent points which I would like to reiterate today as we debate the Gambling Control and Gambling Regulatory Authority of Singapore Bills.",1,314,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00314
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In my view, these Bills are positive steps to stay ahead in the ever-changing gambling landscape with an increasingly blurred boundary between gambling and gaming. The reconstitution of the Casino Regulatory Authority with the rationalisation and consolidation of other Government agencies, such as the Gambling Regulatory Unit, Singapore Tote Board, departments within the Police and MSF that are addressing social gambling problems to establish a single unified Gambling Regulatory Authority is an important step of consolidating resources to address gambling, not just from narrow, segregated lenses, but taking a holistic approach to gambling policies and issues.",2,315,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00315
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"One issue, which I believe warrants attention, is the blurring boundaries between gambling and gaming. Business models have adapted to changing customer preferences by introducing gambling elements that are traditionally not perceived as gambling, such as loot boxes in both physical gaming arcades and in virtual games, which my colleague, Aljunied Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Giam, has spoken about earlier. However, while physical gaming arcades are waning in popularity and ubiquity in our shopping malls today, with some game developers, such as Epic Games, removing loot boxes from Fortnite and other games, we can be sure that gaming developers will be moving fast, faster than regulators globally in trying to innovate their ways to higher profits.",3,316,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00316
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"One particular area of concern in my view, is that of non-fungible tokens or NFT gaming. As it is, Electronic Arts (EA)'s FIFA Ultimate Team packs, which are a form of loot boxes or surprise mechanics, in the words of the company, have their benefits restricted to the in-game experience. And indeed, I note in the public consultation last year that the current regulations do not consider games of chance with virtual prizes as gambling as long as there are no in-game monetisation facilities that allow players to exchange virtual prizes for real-world payouts.",4,317,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00317
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"However, when a picture of a monkey looking bored can cost as high as a few million dollars and potentially having benefits in the physical world, then you know that the stakes and potential financial rewards from being successful in an NFT game are significantly much higher. NFTs may also be sold for cryptocurrency, typically Ethereum, which can then be sold for fiat currency eventually.",5,318,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00318
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"On the more simplistic level, there are also actual gambling facilities in particular games where you can lose in-game currency purchased with fiat currency, like the casino in GTA Online. May I ask if the GRA has dedicated resources looking at not just loot boxes, but other evolutionary forms of games of chance or gaming activity and how does the Ministry intend to get ahead of the curve in monitoring developments in this area?",6,319,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00319
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"This brings me to my second point on illegal online gambling. Even as recent as last week, I have received SMSes from local mobile numbers and WhatsApp messages inviting me to online casinos or to set up betting accounts for football or horse racing. May I ask, how is the Ministry looking to clamp down on such activities, particularly as some of them may not be physically operating such syndicates within Singapore, but yet are clearly targeting locals.",7,320,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00320
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Next, I note the new offence of proxy gambling, which I understand was to close a loophole where there was a case in 2019 in which the individuals could not be taken to task as proxy gambling was not previously criminalised. In 2016, when proxy gambling was banned in Macau, it was reported in Forbes that the business had migrated to other countries within Asia. What safeguards and regulations are being rolled out to ensure that the two casino licensees are proactively assisting the Government to enforce the ban on proxy gambling and what penalties could be imposed if they are found to be negligent or even abetting such practices?",8,321,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00321
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"And finally, the Gambling Control Bill has specifically provided an exemption regime for social gambling among family and friends conducted in homes. I believe many households, especially during Chinese New Year, would be relieved to hear that mahjong, ""ban-luck"" or blackjack sessions are not illegal per se. By extension, however, Singaporeans have taken to staycations and if my memory does not fail me, I recall mahjong sets and tables being part of items that are available for a loan at holiday chalets back in the day. Would social gambling at such non-home locations, among family and friends, fall under the exemption? At the same time, while it is not the Government's intention to babysit individual behaviours at home and most social gambling involve low quantum, low-risk bets placed on a recreational basis, I wonder what form of safeguards and support mechanisms are in place for families where there could be serious and regular high-stakes games in social gambling sessions or excessive social gambling sessions that results in gambling addiction. This could still have social costs which would just be as undesirable as other form of gambling.",9,322,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00322
2022-03-11-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While gamblers themselves, or their family members, can call the Gambling Addiction Hotline to restrict themselves from the casinos, we probably cannot ban people from entering other people's homes on a daily basis.

While this may appear to be an improvement from 52% in 2017, COVID-19 restrictions may be one of the main reasons behind this. Since 2005, the gambling rate in Singapore has hovered around 50%.",11,324,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00324

However, I also hope that we can provide more support and protection for families that need help, to prevent their family member from turning to problem gambling or pathological gambling from social gambling.",13,326,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00326

2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the gambling landscape has evolved greatly. Modern and emerging forms of gambling, enabled by technology, make youths and even young children, susceptible to its insidious nature. Our seniors are also increasingly vulnerable as they are consuming more online content. We must ensure that our regulatory approach towards gambling is up-to-date and forward-looking.",1,328,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00328
2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Regulation and enforcement of gambling laws is sometimes like a cat and mouse game. Despite laws and resources to conduct enforcement, illegal service providers and gambling addicts will try to circumvent these regulations. They will also search for ambiguities to evade the rules. The constant stream of unsolicited text messages touting illegal betting activities comes to mind. I support the consolidation of regulation bodies under a single Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) to regulate all forms of gambling activities. This will allow for a more holistic and cohesive management of gambling policies, as well as the emerging trends and products related to gambling. In doing so, we can better identify and minimise loopholes in the system. In my Budget debate speech last week, I called for more efforts to streamline processes and reduce redundancy in the public service, to cut out unnecessary costs and resource wastage. Consolidating agencies and regulations is a step in the right direction. I have four queries on the Bill.",2,329,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00329
2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, will the Ministry share details about how the merger of the different regulatory bodies will be conducted?

2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, how will the consolidation of gambling control measures impact the management of cross-border remote gambling? Despite good efforts from our Singapore Police Force to reign in illegal remote gambling, it is getting increasingly rampant. There have been several reports about remote gambling operations being uncovered in Singapore. It is also common to receive text messages from unknown sources that promote illegal gambling activities. Some elderly residents have asked me about the constant flow of texts they had received about horse and soccer betting. The borderless nature of remote gambling makes it clandestine. Compulsive gamblers would use Virtual Private Networks to access blocked websites and apps. Some countries have introduced or updated their remote gambling laws, including Germany, the UK and Switzerland. They would license some commercial remote gambling platforms, and subject them to gambling duties.",4,331,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00331
2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Third, can the Ministry provide further clarification on products and services containing financial risk elements, which are being excluded? For example, the Ministry clarified that there are no intentions of treating investments in financial products as gambling products, as those are already regulated through other legislations and fall under the purview of MAS. Likewise, the Ministry also stated the exemption for physical social gambling among family and friends at home. What about products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are not regulated? Some have likened it to gambling because of the amount of speculation involved.",5,332,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00332
2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Lastly, how will the updated Advertising and Promotion (A&P) laws apply to activities containing an optional gambling element, including mobile games with mystery boxes? I note that the Gambling Control Bill seeks to introduce consistency with regards to treatment of A&P offences across all types of gambling. In Singapore, A&P for gambling activities is not allowed, unless specifically approved by the authorities. Currently, we still see such mobile games being advertised on mainstream media and outdoor advertising platforms.",6,333,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00333
2022-03-11-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Admittedly, a blanket restriction on A&P could come across as harsh for games, where the main gameplay has no gambling elements. Publicity for online games tends to be driven through player communities. Therefore, reducing exposure through A&P also has limits to practicality. Ultimately, education and awareness, along with laws and enforcement, are important to curb gambling. Parents too must do their part to impart financial literacy to their children and pay heed to their online activities.",7,334,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00334

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Gerald Giam asked about the exemption on physical social gambling. As Mr Gerald Giam pointed out, currently, physical social gambling is already not disallowed. Such activities are commonplaces amongst many Singaporeans, such as playing mahjong at home, especially during the Chinese New Year festival, and law-and-order concerns in this aspect are low.",2,373,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00373
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"The exemption will regularise this current practice and provide clarity to the public that social gambling is allowed when it is with family and friends at home. This includes social gambling with minors. Social gambling will only be allowed in a person's home and will not be allowed in places like hotels and chalets, which Mr Louis Chua was asking about, and since covering non-residential places under the exemption could be exploited by criminal elements.",3,374,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00374
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"The exemption on social gambling does not change the Government's approach towards gambling. In fact, we are tightening. And why is this so?",4,375,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00375
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Today, physical social gambling is not disallowed. So, we see in commonplaces people playing mahjong and card games. But with this Bill, we are actually making it clear that social gambling is allowed, subject to conditions. And these conditions, as I have mentioned earlier on, are currently not present in law. Actually, these conditions, if you think about it, act as social safeguards. Individuals should exercise personal responsibility in deciding whether to allow underaged individuals to engage in such activities.",5,376,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00376
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Louis Chua both asked how the amendments to gambling legislation would impact the management of cross-border online gambling and illegal online gambling. Similar to the Remote Gambling Act, the Gambling Control Bill will cover situations where the facilities are outside or partially outside of Singapore.",6,377,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00377
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"A key part of our strategy to combat illegal online gambling is our blocking measures for illegal online gambling websites as well as advertisements that can be accessed in Singapore, as well as the payment services that are linked to illegal online gambling.

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"But no blocking measures are foolproof, as the Members also highlighted. Hence, the blocking regime has to be complemented by strong enforcement by the Police on illegal online gambling activities which happen in Singapore and allowing Singapore Pools to offer legal online gambling services which, in turn, allows us to have better control of the services provided.",8,379,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00379

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,Mr Louis Ng asked about the defence in clause 34 on inducement to underaged individuals to gamble. The offence of inducement to gamble in clause 34 has strict liability. This means that a person commits an offence once he sends out any inducement to gamble and with no need for the prosecution to prove the intent to induce. We need to structure this offence as a strict liability offence to allow for more effective prosecution. Illegal gambling operators who send such inducements will often claim that they had unintentionally sent an inducement to underaged individuals.,10,381,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00381
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"However, on the other hand, it is not our intention to cover scenarios where sending the inducements do not benefit the accused and are not sent in the course of business. What this means, for example, is that a person without any links to the illegal gambling operator could have forwarded a screenshot of gambling inducement to a Whatsapp group with underaged individuals inside and he does it as an educational or warning material to warn the group members on the harms of illegal online gambling. Hence, the defence clause allows the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he or she did not benefit from the inducement or the messages that were sent out.",11,382,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00382
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Gerald Giam asked how chance-based loot boxes in online games will be regulated.

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Currently, our laws and regulations do not consider chance-based loot boxes as gambling as long as there are no in-game monetisation facilities. So, as long as they do not have these facilities that allow players to exchange virtual prizes for real-world payouts, such as money or merchandise. This position is set out in IMDA's 2015 advisory on the scope of the Remote Gambling Act. It does not matter whether the loot box is optional or intentional.",13,384,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00384

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Gerald Giam asked if loot boxes will be considered as a lottery if virtual rewards cannot be monetised in the real-world.

This is in line with our current approach, which has served us well in trying to strike a balance between leisure and entertainment and safeguarding against gambling inducement.",15,386,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00386
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"We agree with Mr Yip Hon Weng that a blanket restriction on the advertisement of online games would not be practical, especially since these games are perceived by many as leisure and entertainment.

The Commissioner of Police entry ban is issued to persons to prevent or to reduce criminal influence or exploitation in the management and operation of regulated gambling activities and to maintain gaming integrity in the gambling services. It is targeted against persons who pose law-and-order concerns. Law enforcement agencies will consider the individual's criminal records, as well as other criminal history, including warnings and discharges not amounting to an acquittal. For example, this could include persons previously convicted of offences related to syndicated criminal activity.",18,389,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00389

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"First, there are safeguards to prevent underaged individuals to gambling, or exposing them directly to gambling activity.

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Louis Chua asked about how casino operators are going to help enforce against proxy gambling. There are various ways today to detect proxy gambling in casinos and casino staff are actually trained to detect it. Some indications include players constantly checking their mobile phones and appearing to be receiving instructions while gambling. Casinos will be liable to regulatory action, like financial penalties, if they fail to enforce this.",26,397,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00397
2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng pointed out about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could be considered as gambling due to the amount of speculation involved. Mr Chua also spoke about this topic. NFTs are a form of digital token, where each token has distinct and unique features that are verified and secured by blockchain technology. MAS takes a technology-neutral stance and ""looks through"" to the underlying characteristics of the token to determine if it is to be regulated. Most NFTs currently do not fall under MAS' regulatory remit, as they are used mainly to tokenise digital art and other collectibles. But should an NFT have the characteristics of a capital markets product under the Securities and Futures Act, it will be subject to MAS' regulatory requirements and therefore exempted from the definition of betting in Clause 5 of the Gambling Control Bill.",27,398,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00398

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Yip asked for details on the consolidation of gambling regulatory functions across various agencies.

2022-03-11-T-008,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"I thank the Member for the clarification. The first question, the answer is yes, there is no minimum age for social gambling within homes and that is the reason why we have mentioned that we wanted to put social gambling under the exemption regime precisely, and also to state the conditions. And so the conditions as mentioned, there are threefold. One, is that it has to happen in a home and not outside of the home; secondly, it has to happen within the context of a family, as well as friends, people acquainted with each other; and thirdly, there ought to be no gains, financial gains, from this social gambling.",1,407,2022-03-11-T-008-S-00407

I mentioned in my speech that when it comes to social gambling, especially during the festival period, we know and we recognise that this is something that is happening and this is something that is a tradition for some of the families as well.

I think NCPG's approach is that of a broad stroke, because to tackle the problem of youth gambling, we want to not just look at youth. We want to look at the family as well.

2022-03-11-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what are the details of SAF's COVID-19 rapid containment plans at military camps; and (b) how effective has this measure been in containing COVID-19 outbreaks in camps.,1,428,2022-03-11-T-011-S-00428
2022-03-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) deploys a combination of COVID-19 measures including vaccination, testing, safe management and quick containment in the event of cases. The measures are broadly aligned with national COVID-19 guidelines, and are reviewed as the COVID-19 situation evolves.",1,429,2022-03-11-T-011-S-00429
2022-03-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"On vaccination, as of 2 March 2022, 99.7 per cent of MINDEF/SAF personnel have been vaccinated, and 91 per cent have received their booster shot. To detect COVID-19 infections early and minimise its spread, the SAF has instituted regular testing and Safe Management Measures (SMM) such as training in smaller group sizes and mask-on policy where possible. As for containment, when service personnel in camp are tested positive, they are immediately sent home. Those who are sick or who are tested positive outside are only allowed to return to camp when they have recovered. Close contacts of positive cases, including those identified by the Ministry of Health's (MOH) contact tracing mechanism, are required to adhere to MOH's Health Risk Notice protocol.",2,430,2022-03-11-T-011-S-00430
2022-03-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In recent weeks, the SAF's infection numbers have trended generally in line with the community cases, with most of our cases brought in from the community. While there has been limited onward transmission within our camps, and the vast majority of SAF personnel who contracted the virus have exhibited either mild or no symptoms thus far, we are not taking things for granted. Infections have the potential to spread. We are tracking the numbers closely and remain ready to adjust our measures if necessary so as to maintain our operational readiness while keeping our people safe.",3,431,2022-03-11-T-011-S-00431
2022-03-11-T-012,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past year, whether the Ministry has received requests from households for additional antigen rapid test (ART) kits; (b) if so, what is the number of such requests, broken down by (i) monthly household income and (ii) dwelling type; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider initiating the distribution of additional ART kits to low-income households.",1,432,2022-03-11-T-012-S-00432
2022-03-11-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The Ministry of Health (MOH) has taken various measures to ensure that ART kits are widely available.,1,433,2022-03-11-T-012-S-00433
2022-03-11-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We conducted two nation-wide distributions of free ART kits to households in August and October 2021. Persons who test positive and their registered close contacts can collect free kits from ART vending machines located island-wide. We also issued over 200,000 ART kits to all Social Service Offices (SSOs) and 47 Family Service Centres (FSC) since October 2021, to be made available for their beneficiaries. We have also already facilitated more ART kit brands that meet our quality standards to be approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and made available for sale locally. The average ART kit retail price has thus been reduced from $12 to under $5.",2,434,2022-03-11-T-012-S-00434
2022-03-11-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As we go through the Omicron wave, the demand for ART kits is high, and globally, supply is tight. Fortunately, we have secured supply early, and is generally able to meet demand so far. Another nation-wide distribution of ART kits will be welcomed by many, but will not be the best use of our stock at this stage.",3,435,2022-03-11-T-012-S-00435
2022-03-11-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower for each year between 2016 and 2020, how many and what percentage of employers of work permit holders have been (i) investigated (ii) issued with warnings (iii) issued with composition fines (iv) charged or (v) convicted, for compelling their workers to work on their rest days without prior written agreement.",1,436,2022-03-11-T-013-S-00436
2022-03-11-T-013,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The Member should be aware that there is no legal requirement that consent for work on rest day must be given in writing. However, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) advises that if work on a rest day is routinely scheduled, such agreement should be captured in writing to avoid disputes. Workers are entitled to withdraw consent any time.",1,437,2022-03-11-T-013-S-00437
2022-03-11-T-013,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Between 2016 and 2021, MOM received an average of 20 complaints each year involving work permit holders against employers for not providing one rest day a week. Employers were issued with advisories, warnings or composition fines in most instances and follow up inspections were conducted if necessary. All employers, many of whom were first time SME employers, rectified their employment practices promptly after MOM intervened.",2,438,2022-03-11-T-013-S-00438
