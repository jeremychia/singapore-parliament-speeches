2022-04-05-T-001-S-00001,2022-04-05-T-001,1,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) among private hire car drivers and food delivery riders, what are their (i) mean and median employment duration and (ii) numbers according to age group; (b) whether the Ministry tracks the number and percentage of these riders who have moved on to permanent employment in other industries and, if so, what are these numbers in each of the past five years; and (c) whether the Ministry can provide customised career transition programmes for these riders to help them successfully find alternative employment."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00002,2022-04-05-T-001,2,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the concerns that platform companies and gig workers have raised with respect to the suggestion for platform companies to make mandatory CPF contributions for gig workers; (b) whether a survey or poll has been conducted to determine the proportion of gig workers who support such a suggestion; and (c) if so, what are the survey results."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00003,2022-04-05-T-001,3,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the longer-term job outlook for food delivery riders; and (b) whether there is a need to improve the employability and career planning for food delivery riders.
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00004,2022-04-05-T-001,4,Yeo Wan Ling,"asked the Minister for Manpower given that many freelancers, such as food delivery riders and point-to-point (P2P) drivers, do not determine the fees of services, but leave it to their platform partners' discretion, what are some of the safeguards that will be considered to ensure that these companies comply with their obligations should CPF contributions be made mandatory."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00005,2022-04-05-T-001,5,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 1 to 4, please?"
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00006,2022-04-05-T-001,6,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00007,2022-04-05-T-001,7,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, platform workers face unique conditions at work. They are subject to management control and are not able to set their own fees or remuneration, unlike the typical freelancers that we know. However, compared to employees, they receive lower job protections."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00008,2022-04-05-T-001,8,Koh Poh Koon,"To address this, the Advisory Committee on Platform Workers was convened in September last year to look into three key areas of concern, namely  enhancing housing and retirement adequacy, providing financial protection in the event of work injury and strengthening representation."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00009,2022-04-05-T-001,9,Koh Poh Koon,"Since it was convened, the Committee has actively engaged stakeholders through dialogues as well as a public consultation paper. To date, we have reached out to more than 20,000 platform workers and received about 1,200 submissions from them. To Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman’s question, more than half of these submissions touched on CPF contributions, of which, 55% indicated support for the idea of mandatory CPF contributions to platform workers. Housing was the most commonly cited reason for wanting CPF contributions, followed by retirement. This is not surprising, as platform workers today only make CPF contributions to their MediSave Accounts for their healthcare needs. In the coming months, we will continue with our engagement efforts and encourage all stakeholders, including platform workers, to share their views."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00010,2022-04-05-T-001,10,Koh Poh Koon,"The Committee is also aware that other surveys on platform work were commissioned and published recently, some of which were commissioned by the platform companies. These surveys vary in methodology and some have much smaller numbers of respondents. Some of these surveys also did not capture the management controls and challenges that the platform workers face. An independent ethnographic study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on delivery riders found that riders who are keen to earn an income of more than $4,000 a month would likely need to work more than 10 hours a day, for six to seven days a week, cycling at least 60 kilometres to 70 kilometres a day and not reject any assigned orders. They need to maintain long and disciplined hours at work and must certainly be physically fit. There is significant physical and mental stress imposed on these workers."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00011,2022-04-05-T-001,11,Koh Poh Koon,"While the surveys differ in their emphasis and findings, the one consistent feedback they note is that platform workers do experience greater uncertainty and would appreciate some aspects of what employees enjoy, such as the benefit of CPF contributions and work injury compensation."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00012,2022-04-05-T-001,12,Koh Poh Koon,"Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked about how mandatory CPF contributions for platform workers could be implemented. Without prejudging the outcome of the Committee’s deliberations, if this is implemented, we will develop appropriate mechanisms to ensure compliance."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00013,2022-04-05-T-001,13,Koh Poh Koon,"Today, platform workers already make mandatory CPF contributions out of their own earnings, although at a lower level of contribution, compared to an employee. The Committee is mindful that if mandatory CPF contribution for platform workers is introduced, platform companies will also have to start making contributions. While this will increase their business costs, it is no worse off than any other company employing workers in a similar sector, such as in logistics and transport. Besides, platform companies already contribute CPF for their management executives and administrative staff today, a point which many of these riders whom I engage with, make as well. They ask the question – as the ones who are bringing in revenue for the companies, risking themselves on the roads – why are they not given some of these basic things that employees working for the companies in the office actually also enjoy."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00014,2022-04-05-T-001,14,Koh Poh Koon,"But at the same time, the Committee is also aware that some platform workers are concerned about the impact on their take-home earnings. This somehow also suggests that platform workers are not as well-paid, as some recent surveys have tried to portray."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00015,2022-04-05-T-001,15,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Leon Perera and Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the profile and longer-term career prospects of platform workers. In 2021, the majority of those who depended on platform work as their main job were older residents aged 50 and over, although delivery workers tended to be slightly younger, with the majority aged below 40. This is not surprising, as riders have to maintain a certain level of physical fitness and toil for many hours a day covering long distances in order to keep their earning levels high, as I had earlier described. The majority, or around 80% of those whose main job is a platform worker, view it as their preferred job. In 2021, 8% of those who depended on platform work as their main job switched to work primarily as an employee – a slight increase from the 5% to 6% in recent years."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00016,2022-04-05-T-001,16,Koh Poh Koon,"We will continue to support platform workers to actively plan their careers and strengthen their employability, while respecting the preference of many to continue in platform work. For those looking for employment opportunities, Workforce Singapore and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute offer career matching services, including career coaching, employability workshops and job fairs. The Workfare Skills Support Scheme and SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package are also available to them."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00017,2022-04-05-T-001,17,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, at the height of the pandemic and the circuit breaker, these delivery riders helped maintain our quality of life by risking themselves to meet our needs. Singaporeans have called for more to be done for this group of precarious workers. These are often the forgotten heroes during the pandemic."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00018,2022-04-05-T-001,18,Koh Poh Koon,"So, even as we gradually ease into the endemic phase of our fight against COVID-19, let us not forget the needs of this group of precarious workers. The Committee’s work is still ongoing. As it continues to consult widely and facilitate deeper discussions, we will take in the feedback from platform workers and platform companies. The Committee aims to provide practicable and sustainable recommendations and is considering an appropriate phase-in period to allow the industry to adjust."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00019,2022-04-05-T-001,19,Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00020,2022-04-05-T-001,20,Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. Two supplementary questions. Regarding the figure given of 8% who have transitioned to permanent employment, would the Senior Minister of State have any data of the demographic profile of those who moved out of platform work into permanent employment of some sort or other? Are they the older ones or are they the younger ones?"
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00021,2022-04-05-T-001,21,Leon Perera,"Secondly, given the developments in technology and also the fact that this kind of work that the platform workers do may be harder for older people to do physically, there is a long-term employability concern that the Senior Minister of State alluded to. Would the Government consider, going forward, engaging more proactive communications to these platform workers, make them aware of these challenges and to stimulate them to think more about their long-term career prospects in other industries? There is drone delivery, for example, that is displacing some of these jobs already in some cities."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00022,2022-04-05-T-001,22,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, the Member rightly pointed out some of the concerns that the Committee is deliberating on. These are the concerns of some of the workers themselves  the fear of autonomous vehicles replacing their jobs and also, for the riders at least, it being such a physically demanding career, there is a question of how they can sustain this over a long period of time and make it a lifelong career. Also, the risk of being injured any day and once you cannot physically subject yourself to that kind of toil anymore, the income would be impacted."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00023,2022-04-05-T-001,23,Koh Poh Koon,"On the other hand, the workers do value the flexibility and autonomy, to some extent, that they have. It is also a job with low barriers to entry and allows them quick access to ready cash to tide over a period of need. So, there are pros and cons. And the Committee would continue to consult and engage our stakeholders."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00024,2022-04-05-T-001,24,Koh Poh Koon,"In terms of encouraging the workers to then look at a career transition, this is something that we have already put in place – some measures and schemes to support them. Ultimately, it is also helping them to raise their awareness of what would make a sustainable career and help them to acquire the skills that are necessary to transit into a sector that may be of interest to them. Skills upgrading is still core to the whole endeavour."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00025,2022-04-05-T-001,25,Koh Poh Koon,"But I think this is a complex issue. The demographics are quite widespread. Different segments of people, different needs. So, I do not think there is a one-size-fits-all strategy that will cater to all and appeal to all of them. I think we need to look at this from a multi-pronged perspective. Therefore, in answer to the first question posed, on what are the demographics of the 8% who may have made the transition, I do not have the full data. My sense is that it is a very disparate group  some could be younger; some could be older; some could be more educated; some, because of their physical conditions, realise they need to transit to something that is less physically demanding. I think it is a broad spectrum, the point being that we need many different things to meet the different needs of different groups of people. It is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all solution, nor a fixed archetype."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00026,2022-04-05-T-001,26,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00027,2022-04-05-T-001,27,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon Senior Minister of State what proportion of platform workers are ex-offenders and what steps can be taken to encourage ex-offenders to look at more value-added jobs so that their long-term prospects would be protected?"
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00028,2022-04-05-T-001,28,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, the Member asked an important question. We did say that this is a job with low barriers to entry and, unfortunately, I do not think the companies themselves track such data, such as what is the status of this person's jobs before, during or after they join platform work. Because, it is just as simple as downloading an app, getting a simple sign-up and they can start to engage in this kind of work. I think the challenge is in getting this data."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00029,2022-04-05-T-001,29,Koh Poh Koon,"We will try to do some surveys on this but I think it is very hard for us to get very, very accurate data on how many percentage of them are ex-offenders. Not all of them will also engage in this full-time. Some of them are doing it as a supplement. As I have said, the landscape is very diverse and the challenge is to get a true fix. At one point in time, we may get a single snapshot on how many ex-offenders are working in platform work, but they could easily exit the next day. And more may come on the day after. This is where, whatever intervention we design, we need to have that flexibility to cater to the evolving needs of this group of workers."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00030,2022-04-05-T-001,30,Koh Poh Koon,"Upstream intervention, including the Yellow Ribbon project, would be very important to make sure that ex-offenders, before they are re-integrated into society, are already given some degree of skills-training to allow them to, from the outset, look for jobs that are able to sustain them for the longer term and have employers who are prepared to take them on as employees so that there is perhaps less impetus for them to enter platform work as the job of choice when they get out into the rest of society."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00031,2022-04-05-T-001,31,Koh Poh Koon,"I think it takes all stakeholders, including the Singapore Prison Service, including employers who are enlightened, to engage and work with ex-offenders."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00032,2022-04-05-T-001,32,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00033,2022-04-05-T-001,33,Pritam Singh,I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if he has any recent data on how many of these platform workers actually make CPF contributions on their own accord.
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00034,2022-04-05-T-001,34,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I do not have the actual data. Because at this moment, some of them are doing this only as a very small segment of their working life. So, they could be working on a very casual basis. Thus, they may not, actually, make contributions to CPF, if they are not working in this job as a full-time platform worker."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00035,2022-04-05-T-001,35,Koh Poh Koon,"We are trying to get data from CPF and the platform companies to see if we can get a better sense of it. But our assessment is that probably around 45% or thereabout, are making some CPF contributions. At best, it is probably about half of them doing so. We hope to get clearer data when we engage with the drivers, riders as well as the platform companies."
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00036,2022-04-05-T-001,36,Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00037,2022-04-05-T-001,37,Yeo Wan Ling,"Would MOM also consider phasing in CPF contributions by platform companies to cushion any price impact on consumers and alleviate any potential adverse impact on the take-home income of our platform workers, which is something that the Labour Movement is, ultimately, the most worried about?"
2022-04-05-T-001-S-00038,2022-04-05-T-001,38,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, in my main reply, I did say that the Committee is considering some potential mechanism like a phase-in period. That is probably one way to actually ease the industry into this transition of some CPF contribution, so that the immediate impact on both consumers, platform workers and the business costs of the companies can be managed over time. This is something that the Committee will engage further with the companies and the workers before landing on a fixed recommendation."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00039,2022-04-05-T-002,39,Leong Mun Wai,"Question No 5, please."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00040,2022-04-05-T-002,40,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, my answer will address Question No 5 from Ms Hazel Poa from today's Order Paper and also similar related questions raised by Ms Ng Ling Ling"
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00041,2022-04-05-T-002,41,Janil Puthucheary,It was with a heavy heart that I read about the unfortunate incident that happened at National University Hospital (NUH) two weeks ago. I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the family for their tragic loss. The couple has had discussions with the NUH team and the matter has since been closed between the two parties.
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00042,2022-04-05-T-002,42,Janil Puthucheary,"The family had put up a social media post recently acknowledging this and further acknowledged that the mother had not been left unattended for two hours. Indeed, she received attention and care from the NUH Emergency Department (ED) team from the time that she arrived. They further noted that the sad and unfortunate outcome of the pregnancy was not the result of her experience at the hospital. Out of respect for the couple's request for privacy and confidentiality reasons, I will not go into details of the case."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00043,2022-04-05-T-002,43,Janil Puthucheary,"NUH has investigated the matter thoroughly and reviewed their processes, in consultation with MOH and the Director of Medical Services. Their clinical care processes are appropriate, but there were some areas for improved communications and the coordination for transfers between the ED and the Delivery Suite. NUH has implemented these improvements."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00044,2022-04-05-T-002,44,Janil Puthucheary,"COVID-19 has resulted in the public hospitals' EDs facing very high demands and our healthcare workers have been working continuously to attend to all patients with COVID-19 and those with non-COVID-19 conditions. All patients will be triaged based on presenting history, symptoms and clinical parameters so that those with life-threatening conditions are prioritised. No patient will be denied care."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00045,2022-04-05-T-002,45,Janil Puthucheary,I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all healthcare workers for their professionalism and dedication in caring for all their patients.
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00046,2022-04-05-T-002,46,Speaker,Mr Edward Chia.
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00047,2022-04-05-T-002,47,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. The Singaporean couple at the heart of the matter are, actually, residents of Zhenghua. As their Member of Parliament, I have communicated with them on several occasions and having to cremate one's child is an emotional journey for any parent. The father told me that it was never his intention to cast any blame on the hospital or the healthcare workers when he posted on social media. His intention was to really seek answers for the two hours of wait time that he and his wife experienced at the A&E."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00048,2022-04-05-T-002,48,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"It was so because he was unable to seek answers or any response over a period of five days and this included the time when his wife was being treated at a high dependency ward. He finally got a response from a patient care officer when his post went viral. Therefore, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, following this incident and with the objective of improving protocols, would MOH be assessing how hospitals should improve the provision of critical information to patients in a timely manner with empathy. I do believe that greater transparency will strengthen the trust that Singaporeans already have in our healthcare institutions."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00049,2022-04-05-T-002,49,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Mr Edward Chia for the question. Notwithstanding the findings that the clinical care processes were appropriate and not contributing to the outcome, the NUH team did, indeed, look through how they performed their communication, how they provided the information that was available to reassure and inform the couple. And, indeed, there were ways in which they could improve that, they recognised this and they have already instituted changes to the processes to make sure that information is provided in a timely manner and done so in a way that is more acceptable to the patients and their families. And this process review was done in consultation with MOH and the Director of Medical Services. The lessons will be learnt and shared across our healthcare system."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00050,2022-04-05-T-002,50,Speaker,"Dr Janil Puthucheary, you mentioned about the question raised by Ms Ng Ling Ling earlier. Which question is that, for our record purposes?"
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00051,2022-04-05-T-002,51,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the questions filed by Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Edward Chia and Dr Wan Rizal have been scheduled for subsequent Sittings."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00052,2022-04-05-T-002,52,Speaker,Thank you. Dr Wan Rizal.
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00053,2022-04-05-T-002,53,Wan Rizal,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for that. My concern is really for the healthcare workers who were involved in this unfortunate incident, because when this news went viral, clearly, they were the first in line to be blamed. My question is  how could we better protect them in the future when these things happen again? Because, apparently, it was not the first; there was a subsequent incident where healthcare workers were blamed. What can we do to protect them in the future in this regard?"
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00054,2022-04-05-T-002,54,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Dr Wan Rizal for the question. Adverse incidents will happen in these complex, high-risk and high-intensity situations. And when they do, everybody feels bad, it is a tragic outcome from an emotive empathy point of view. Anybody hearing about it feels lost, feels sympathy. If you are potentially the healthcare worker involved, you worry about the care that you delivered, whether you have made an error, whether your team has allowed something to happen, when the allegation is made."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00055,2022-04-05-T-002,55,Janil Puthucheary,"However, all of these allegations and comments do need to be investigated. I think we should not take the view that somehow we should not look into them. We should look into them. We must investigate the process because that is our duty to the patients and the families that we care for. And the best protection then for healthcare workers is quick and thorough establishing of the facts that are involved and to do so in a way that involves the healthcare worker, systematically and professionally."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00056,2022-04-05-T-002,56,Janil Puthucheary,"The processes to investigate and follow up on incidents, such as these, are well-known to our healthcare system and healthcare staff. Nevertheless, it can be taxing and draining on the healthcare workers who are involved and we have services that are available for counselling and psychological support for the healthcare workers that are within the system and are working in these situations."
2022-04-05-T-002-S-00057,2022-04-05-T-002,57,Janil Puthucheary,"At root, however, it would be helpful if, when allegations and incidents are raised, that these are based on facts rather than speculation."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00058,2022-04-05-T-003,58,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what safeguards are in place to protect members of the public, particularly children and women, from recalcitrant sex offenders; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider lifelong counselling and monitoring of these offenders."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00059,2022-04-05-T-003,59,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. Members know that the law provides for stiff action to be taken and stiff action is taken against sex offenders. Recalcitrant sex offenders receive even heavier sentences. These include longer imprisonment terms and sentences under the Corrective Training (CT) and Preventive Detention (PD) regimes. Under both CT and PD regimes, repeat offenders can be sentenced to imprisonment terms which are longer than the maximum term prescribed for the offence. CT sentences can range from five to 14 years and PD sentences can range from seven to 14 years. Such offenders also undergo longer rehabilitation programmes and supervision. ["
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00060,2022-04-05-T-003,60,K Shanmugam,"Members know that we have been extremely focused on this proactively, always looking to see what else we can do to try and protect members of the public, particularly vulnerable members of the public. I had asked MHA and MinLaw to study a new sentencing option, quite a novel approach, to give more protection to the public from dangerous first-time offenders as well as repeat offenders, who commit very serious hurt and sexual offences. The proposal is not quite fleshed out yet but the framework or the outline is that offenders will have to serve a minimum jail sentence, which could be anywhere between five and 20 years."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00061,2022-04-05-T-003,61,K Shanmugam,"When the jail sentences end, when they have completed it, there will be no automatic release. At the point of release, they have to be assessed as to whether they pose a threat to the public. If they are assessed to continue to pose a threat, they will continue to be detained. This, as Members can see, would represent a major change in the way our sentencing regime works, because, today, the Court imposes a sentence and when it ends, the person is released."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00062,2022-04-05-T-003,62,K Shanmugam,"The United Kingdom tried this approach, I have to say, with very mixed results. But I think we can make it work and the rationale is very simple. A person commits an offence. It is a serious heinous offence. Say, raping a young child or a rape followed by murder. The judge can express outrage, he can impose a very stiff sentence, assuming it is not capital punishment. But the judge will not know whether in X number of years, the person will no longer remain a danger to society. And there have been enough cases around the world where the day after the person is released, literally, he goes out and commits another serious offence. We have had not many, but we have had one or two cases in Singapore, too."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00063,2022-04-05-T-003,63,K Shanmugam,"So, really, we can only assess some of these cases at the point of release. We sought public feedback on these proposals in July of last year. We are considering our approach. Obviously, we will come back to the House because any such approach is going to require changes to the law. In addition to the above, agencies like MOE and MSF work closely with the Police to screen those who apply for jobs when they have to work with children in licensed preschools and schools."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00064,2022-04-05-T-003,64,K Shanmugam,"The Member suggested that MHA consider lifelong counselling and monitoring of recalcitrant sex offenders. Today, a sex offender is given psychological assistance by the Singapore Prison Service's (SPS) psychologists. Those who have committed serious sexual offences can also be put on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS). The MAS provides community support, counselling, case management, with supervision for up to two years for inmates who were released and who are at a higher risk of re-offending, or who are in need of more reintegration and support."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00065,2022-04-05-T-003,65,K Shanmugam,SPS also works closely with the families of ex-offenders and community partners to support them after their release. We will refer the Member's suggestion to consider lifelong counselling and monitoring for recalcitrant sex offenders to the relevant agencies for them to consider.
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00066,2022-04-05-T-003,66,Speaker,Ms Joan Pereira.
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00067,2022-04-05-T-003,67,Joan Pereira,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. I have one supplementary question. May I know in scenarios where they are convicted paedophiles, are there any safeguards or precautions to prevent them from working with children?"
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00068,2022-04-05-T-003,68,K Shanmugam,"The safeguards are in licensed vocations, regulated industries or institutions – I mentioned MOE-registered kindergartens and schools. So, employees at these licensed childhood centres, regulated by MSF or Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), must be screened. But those who work in enrichment centres or other commercial service providers for children do not need to be screened in today's framework. Even then, in licensed premises, the question is whether all employees need to be screened, for example, cleaners and so on. We know that MOE does a screening for all, including cleaners, but others may not."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00069,2022-04-05-T-003,69,K Shanmugam,"I have asked my Ministries to look into the screening framework to see how the process can be strengthened. But we need to have a balance between making sure that people have a second chance, but, at the same time, protecting the vulnerable. There are some not so easy issues to consider; for example, what about freelance providers of services – piano teachers or swimming coaches? So, the regulatory framework for that is not so easy to consider, but we will look at it and we will come back before the House."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00070,2022-04-05-T-003,70,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00071,2022-04-05-T-003,71,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a quick question for the Minister. I understand this is a review that is in progress and full details of the proposals are not before the House. For current offenders who are incarcerated – because they have committed serious sexual crimes, in the course of their custodial sentence – are there constant reviews done as to their re-integration later into the public after they have served their sentences? Is that being done currently?"
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00072,2022-04-05-T-003,72,Pritam Singh,"And in terms of the numbers of individuals that we are looking at who are currently serving sentences, how many people would the Minister estimate to come under the regime, based on whatever existing data the Government has?"
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00073,2022-04-05-T-003,73,K Shanmugam,"The first question, as I understand it, is whether we are assessing the current detainees, people who are in jail, for their re-integration back into society. As I have said many times in this House and outside, this is a matter of a very serious focus for the Home Team and the Singapore Prison Service, in that we focus a lot on rehabilitation. And in order to do rehabilitation, when someone who has been imposed with a custodial sentence comes into prison, he or she is assessed on a certain matrix of factors to see what sort of intervention is necessary to help the person. Without going into too much detail, they may be classified as low-risk, medium-risk, high-risk – for example."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00074,2022-04-05-T-003,74,K Shanmugam,"And depending on the total set of factors, including the risk within prison and outside, they are given tailored interventions and assistance, job training, education – you name it – different things. Of course, some, based on our assessment, are not suitable for immediate job training, for example. They need other sorts of intervention first, to get them to be in a place where they can be better rehabilitated. So, there are a whole series of factors and approaches and it is done through the period of detention. But, of course, if they are in there for three months or six months, then these approaches do not work. We are talking about detainees or people in jail for a longer period of time and assessed to be in need of such assistance."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00075,2022-04-05-T-003,75,K Shanmugam,"So, when they come out, we no longer take the approach that ""you are out and, therefore, you are no longer my obligation"". The Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) takes a very detailed approach to try and get them jobs and place them on jobs when they leave and continues with other agencies to try and handhold and assist them thereafter."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00076,2022-04-05-T-003,76,K Shanmugam,"I am not saying that it works for every releasee. Some do not want to know us and, obviously, this only works on the basis of consent. And some will not keep in touch. But for those who need assistance – and, again, we do not have the full set of resources to assist everyone – we try and do our best for as many as we can."
2022-04-05-T-003-S-00077,2022-04-05-T-003,77,K Shanmugam,"So, I think I am answering the question that was asked. If the Leader of Opposition's question is do we assess the risk of re-offending in the way that I have described, for the future, that is part of the assessment, but I am unable to give the numbers. The Leader of the Opposition can file a separate question on that, if he wishes."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00078,2022-04-05-T-004,78,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many CPF members currently have MediSave contributions in arrears with amounts (i) less than $1,000, (ii) between $1,001 and less than $3,000, (iii) between $3,001 and less than $10,000 and (iv) above $10,000, respectively; and (b) for each respective category, how many of them have met the minimum MediSave savings."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00079,2022-04-05-T-004,79,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for those with MediSave contributions in arrears, how many appeals have been received to-date to waive the condition of making up-to-date MediSave contributions so as to receive the various grants given by the Government; (b) what is the success rate of these appeals receiving the waiver; and (c) what are the reasons for the unsuccessful cases."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00080,2022-04-05-T-004,80,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will respond to Question Nos 7 and 8 on MediSave arrears together, so that I can give a more holistic reply."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00081,2022-04-05-T-004,81,Speaker,As in Question Nos 7 and 8 on the Order Paper?
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00082,2022-04-05-T-004,82,Tan See Leng,Yes.
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00083,2022-04-05-T-004,83,Speaker,Please do.
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00084,2022-04-05-T-004,84,Tan See Leng,"While employers process both employee and employer CPF contributions of their workers, Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) are responsible for making their own MediSave contributions after declaring their income for the year. More than 75% of SEPs are able to meet their MediSave obligations in a timely manner. For the remaining SEPs who are unable to do so, about 50% of them have less than $3,000 in outstanding liabilities. Most SEPs with outstanding MediSave liabilities have not met the Basic Healthcare Sum."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00085,2022-04-05-T-004,85,Tan See Leng,"To ensure that SEPs continue to take personal responsibility in saving for their longer-term retirement and healthcare needs, SEPs are required to contribute to their MediSave to qualify for Government schemes, such as Workfare. To enable our lower-income SEPs to benefit from Workfare, SEPs have up to two years to make the required MediSave contributions to qualify. Less than 5% of appeals for Workfare were from SEPs requesting to waive their MediSave contribution requirements."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00086,2022-04-05-T-004,86,Tan See Leng,"We recognise this is a difficult period for many people. The CPF Board has been helping SEPs who are facing difficulties in meeting their MediSave obligations find alternative arrangements, such as by extending their GIRO arrangements to reduce monthly instalments. The Board also considers appeals on a case-by-case basis and exercises flexibilities based on the appellants' needs."
2022-04-05-T-004-S-00087,2022-04-05-T-004,87,Tan See Leng,"Members who are facing significant income loss and require urgent financial assistance can also apply for support through schemes, such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant by MSF. They can visit their nearest Social Service Office if they need further help."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00088,2022-04-05-T-005,88,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Government has any policy prohibiting ex-offenders from entering or being employed at key installations, such as Jurong Island and Changi Airport; (b) if so, what categories of offences are covered by this policy; (c) what conditions need to be met before the prohibition lapses; and (d) if not, how many ex-offenders have been employed at these key installations over the past five years."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00089,2022-04-05-T-005,89,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for the question. There are several facilities in Singapore that require security protection. The security measures required at these different facilities are assessed by the relevant agencies."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00090,2022-04-05-T-005,90,K Shanmugam,"Jurong Island and Changi Airport are among the facilities that are considered to be high risk. Anyone who wishes to have access to the restricted areas in these facilities will have to be screened by the Police. We have seen in Singapore and overseas, incidents where insiders used or attempted to use their access for wrong purposes, sometimes with serious consequences."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00091,2022-04-05-T-005,91,K Shanmugam,"Past offences are a consideration when screening persons for such passes. However, the Police do not rule out ex-offenders on a blanket basis. The factors relating to the offence are assessed. A person with antecedents of concern may also be required to remain offence-free for some time, before he or she is allowed access into such sensitive facilities."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00092,2022-04-05-T-005,92,K Shanmugam,"The Member may wish to clarify the specific categories of offences and the associated facilities that he thinks should be exempted from such screening, if that is the purport of his question. I say this because it is not clear what the real concern is. Is the concern that these people are not able to find decent jobs, or they are not able to find jobs in specific security-sensitive places?"
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00093,2022-04-05-T-005,93,K Shanmugam,"Our approach is to help ex-offenders find decent jobs. Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) works closely with employers and industry partners, so that an ex-offender can find jobs across a wide range of sectors, and not just at key installations."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00094,2022-04-05-T-005,94,K Shanmugam,"As at end of February 2022, about 5,800 employers are registered with YRSG to offer employment to ex-offenders, with over 2,700 job listings. There are many job vacancies. As any employer will tell Members here, the key issue in Singapore is, actually, a lack of manpower."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00095,2022-04-05-T-005,95,K Shanmugam,"YRSG provides employment assistance in three ways  placement services, career retention support and engagements with industry stakeholders."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00096,2022-04-05-T-005,96,K Shanmugam,"On placement services, placement exercises are held in prison to match inmates with suitable employers. The inmate's interests, skill level and incarceration history are considered, to best match them to a job. In 2021, YRSG provided employment assistance to over 2,900 inmates. Of these, over 2,700, or 94% of them, secured jobs successfully."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00097,2022-04-05-T-005,97,K Shanmugam,"But even after finding a job, some may face challenges transiting from prison to the work environment. YRSG assigns a Career Coach to each ex-offender at work for up to 12 months after their release. And that is Career Retention Support. The Career Coaches engage ex-offenders regularly to set behavioural goals and provide encouragement and work closely with their employers to resolve work-related issues."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00098,2022-04-05-T-005,98,K Shanmugam,"So, I hope Members will appreciate that quite a lot is done to help them, because we want them to succeed. Of the ex-offenders released in 2020, Career Retention Support was provided for more than 1,700 persons. As at December 2021, 87% had stayed on the job for three months and 70% for six months. And I think, if you compare it across the world, our approach compares with the best around."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00099,2022-04-05-T-005,99,K Shanmugam,"Third, YRSG actively engages industry and employers on good career opportunities available. Earlier this year, I mentioned the TAP and Grow initiative to this House. Under the TAP and Grow initiative, training academies in prison have been set up in partnership with the Media, Precision Engineering and Logistics sectors. Inmates will be offered jobs by partner employers upon release. About 650 inmates will benefit from the TAP and Grow initiative in these three sectors every year. This year, YRSG aims to expand the initiative into the Food Services sector."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00100,2022-04-05-T-005,100,K Shanmugam,"So, both Mr Leon Perera and other Members can see, a lot of effort has been put into this, into helping ex-offenders find and keep decent jobs. It is not clear to me why the focus is on employment of ex-offenders at key security installations specifically, without considering the wider landscape and the efforts by YRSG, which I am sure all Members are aware of."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00101,2022-04-05-T-005,101,K Shanmugam,"The Member's colleague, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, made a somewhat related set of points last year. And I told him, do you want convicted paedophiles working in childcare centres? Or those who have been convicted of serious offences, albeit non-violent – to use his language – to be security officers at condominiums? Or would it be better that we have a risk matrix and assess suitability for different jobs and yet help all of them find jobs? We take their livelihoods seriously and we want to help them."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00102,2022-04-05-T-005,102,K Shanmugam,"I also suggested to Assoc Prof Jamus Lim that if he suggested some condominiums in suitable places, we can consider trying out his suggestions. Get the residents to agree. The proof of the suggestion and how serious it is, is in getting it done on the ground. Since then, I have not heard from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. Likewise, if Mr Leon Perera thinks it is useful, he can suggest some condominiums to try out these ideas. Then maybe we can take these suggestions seriously and not dismiss them as political soundbites."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00103,2022-04-05-T-005,103,K Shanmugam,"So, I will repeat my suggestion here  if Mr Leon Perera or Assoc Prof Jamus Lim believes that ex-offenders – be they child molesters or have convictions for housebreaking – should be allowed to be, say, security officers, without their conviction record being available to employers or that they should be allowed access to highly security-sensitive locations; first, maybe we can try out some private installations which they can suggest, and I am prepared to consider this favourably."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00104,2022-04-05-T-005,104,K Shanmugam,"If they say, well, it depends on the offence, then, in principle, they agree with the approach taken by the Government and that is what we do now, because we adopt a risk matrix approach."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00105,2022-04-05-T-005,105,Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00106,2022-04-05-T-005,106,Leon Perera,"I thank the Minister for his answer. Just to respond to the Minister's point, the intent of my question was to understand if there was a blanket prohibition for ex-offenders entering to these facilities as, say, delivery drivers or to be employed in these facilities. By looking at this question, my view would be that a nuanced approach and a calibrated approach should be taken whereby the gravity of the offence and the length of time that the ex-offender has been offence-free be taken into consideration, rather than a blanket prohibition be imposed. I think the Minister did confirm that that is the case – that a nuanced approach is taken. And I appreciate the other efforts across the whole landscape that YRSG has been undertaking to help ex-offenders to re-integrate and find alternative employment."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00107,2022-04-05-T-005,107,Leon Perera,"My particular question was just in relation to those two facilities that are, of course, high-risk, we do recognise that, and with a view to ascertain that there is no blanket prohibition. I think the Minister did confirm that is the case. So, that is my response."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00108,2022-04-05-T-005,108,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00109,2022-04-05-T-005,109,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Speaker. I feel that it is useful for me to clarify that the specific Parliamentary Question that I had posed last year mentioned, specifically, that it was with regard to non-violent offenders, of which, in a number of categorisations, including the UN, exclude sexual crimes and misdemeanours."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00110,2022-04-05-T-005,110,Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, I think it is a bit of a mischaracterisation to argue that it is about allowing paedophiles back into the system."
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00111,2022-04-05-T-005,111,Speaker,Minister.
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00112,2022-04-05-T-005,112,K Shanmugam,"Fraud and cheating are also non-violent. So, would the Member consider those people to be suitable to be security officers? Looking at pornography, child pornography is also non-violent. Would the Member agree to such people acting as kindergarten teachers, in registered kindergartens?"
2022-04-05-T-005-S-00113,2022-04-05-T-005,113,K Shanmugam,"So, let us be clear about this. The Government is very focused in trying to assist, but we are also very clear-eyed about trying to make sure that the vulnerable are protected."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00114,2022-04-05-T-006,114,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the move to living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease (a) what are the medium-term plans for the relaxation of vaccination-differentiated measures; and (b) whether COVID-19 positive status will be treated differently from other endemic diseases, such as influenza or pneumonia."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00115,2022-04-05-T-006,115,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) to what extent is TraceTogether data still utilised for contact tracing and COVID-19 management purposes for establishments with a high volume of irregular visitors, such as malls and public attractions; and (b) whether there is any update on the timeline and milestones for the abolition of establishment-entry TraceTogether protocols, given the commencement of streamlined COVID-19 measures."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00116,2022-04-05-T-006,116,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Health whether the Government intends to maintain Vaccination-differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) even after the borders are opened further following the scrapping of the Vaccinated Travel Lanes.
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00117,2022-04-05-T-006,117,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 10, 11 and 12 in today's Order Paper together, please?"
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00118,2022-04-05-T-006,118,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00119,2022-04-05-T-006,119,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, Minister Ong Ye Kung shared the comprehensive reply yesterday to address all of these matters and questions. I would refer the Members to the answers from the Sitting on 4 April 2022."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00120,2022-04-05-T-006,120,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00121,2022-04-05-T-006,121,Jamus Jerome Lim,I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I just wish to pose a quick supplementary question and that has to do with something that was not touched on by Minister Ong Ye Kung.
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00122,2022-04-05-T-006,122,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Given the much shorter incubation and infectious periods for the Omicron and sub-variants, my understanding is that, right now, the Health Risk Warnings tend to arrive a few days after exposure. I imagine that this would be even longer for high-volume locations. I wonder whether the Ministry has plans to move to a policy where TraceTogether may be used to automatically alert users to potential exposures and place the onus on individuals to exercise social responsibility for self-isolating, rather than relying on the Health Risk Warning that is proving to be a little bit behind the curve at the moment."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00123,2022-04-05-T-006,123,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, as we have explained several times in this House, indeed, we are moving towards a posture of social responsibility as the key intervention in the fight against COVID-19. The use of TraceTogether and Safe Entry as a platform is, currently, largely driven by the need for vaccine-differentiated measures."
2022-04-05-T-006-S-00124,2022-04-05-T-006,124,Janil Puthucheary,"Certainly, if we need to step up contact tracing again in the face of an increasing public health risk, the way in which we do that using TraceTogether, SafeEntry, automatic warnings, targeted warnings will be informed by the characteristics of the variant or the wave of the epidemic at that time."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00125,2022-04-05-T-007,125,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the minimum household income required to employ a migrant domestic worker (MDW); (b) what is the rationale for not disclosing such income criteria; and (c) what are the number and percentage of annual MDW applications over the last five years that are rejected based on the household income criterion.
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00126,2022-04-05-T-007,126,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Manpower in respect of senior citizens seeking to employ a migrant domestic worker (MDW) but who do not have an earned income, whether the sponsorship scheme can be expanded to allow for potential employers to set aside the full costs of hiring a MDW over the contract period in an escrow account to demonstrate financial means."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00127,2022-04-05-T-007,127,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will address Question Nos 13 and 14 by Mr Louis Chua together."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00128,2022-04-05-T-007,128,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00129,2022-04-05-T-007,129,Gan Siow Huang,"MOM assesses an applicant's eligibility to employ a migrant domestic worker ( MDW) based on various factors, such as the income of the prospective employer, the ability to provide proper and safe accommodation for the domestic worker and the caregiving needs of the household. Income is not the sole factor in determining whether the application can be approved."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00130,2022-04-05-T-007,130,Gan Siow Huang,"In addition, MOM may consider other relevant information to determine an applicant's financial ability to hire a migrant domestic worker. These include caregiving needs and retired senior citizens without regular income but who have savings. In assessing renewal applications, we also consider the track records of the employers, such as whether they previously defaulted on salary or levy payment. Hence, we do not have a rigid income criterion and do not just reject applications solely on that alone. We do have many factors for consideration."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00131,2022-04-05-T-007,131,Gan Siow Huang,"Over the past five years, an average of about 2,000 cases, or about 1% of all the applications each year, were rejected after taking the various factors into consideration."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00132,2022-04-05-T-007,132,Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00133,2022-04-05-T-007,133,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,I thank the Minister of State for the response. Just a supplementary question in relation to my second Parliamentary Question.
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00134,2022-04-05-T-007,134,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I understand that MOM is rightly concerned about the financial ability of employers who hire and upkeep the MDW. And, especially, when it comes to retiree households, by definition, they would not already have an income. I do note that there is a sponsorship scheme which allows them to nominate their children or other family members to be their sponsors, but some of them may think that they do not want to unnecessarily impose on them when there is no logical need to do so, given that they do have the financial resources. I think the Minister of State has also mentioned that they consider other factors like the savings of these households, for example."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00135,2022-04-05-T-007,135,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I wonder whether or not this could actually be one of the means other than income specifically that is put up as the eligibility criterion, rather than on a case-by-case basis. I have a resident who came to me last month, sharing this concern and we have also written to MOM on his behalf."
2022-04-05-T-007-S-00136,2022-04-05-T-007,136,Gan Siow Huang,"I thank Mr Louis Chua for that question. Indeed, we do consider various forms of financial ability for the applicant to be able to hire an MDW. We do look at savings. And in the case of the resident who was referred to MOM, we have actually been in discussion with the applicant. We are supportive, in principle."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00137,2022-04-05-T-008,137,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for National Development of the HDB blocks that have undergone the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) (a) how many blocks are fitted with machine room-less elevators and bubble lifts to provide direct lift access to such flats; and (b) what is the average cost for the adoption of such innovative technical solutions computed on the basis of per directly-benefiting unit.
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00138,2022-04-05-T-008,138,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for National Development for units in the 150 HDB blocks that do not have direct lift access and are currently unable to benefit from the Lift Upgrading Programmme (LUP) due to technical or costs reasons, whether HDB will consider buying back such flats from eligible flat owners who face genuine difficulties in selling their flats due to the lack of direct lift access, similar to the buyback assistance scheme for flat owners constrained by the Ethnic Integration Policy."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00139,2022-04-05-T-008,139,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 15 and 16 together?"
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00140,2022-04-05-T-008,140,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00141,2022-04-05-T-008,141,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Under the Lift Upgrading Programme, or LUP, about 270 HDB blocks were provided with bubble lifts or machine room-less lifts. For most of these blocks, the cost of providing the lifts was within the LUP cost cap. For some blocks, HDB exercised some flexibility and went beyond the LUP cost cap, so that all the residents in these blocks would be able to have direct lift access. This notwithstanding, providing lifts for some of the remaining 150 blocks without full direct lift access today will be very costly – in some cases, more than $200,000 per household, enough to buy another HDB flat."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00142,2022-04-05-T-008,142,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For these blocks, HDB will continue to explore new methods to bring down LUP costs, as well as alternatives to improve accessibility for residents living in flats without direct lift access."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00143,2022-04-05-T-008,143,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In the meantime, residents living in these blocks who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or mobility reasons, are eligible for the Lift access Housing Grant (LHG) of up to $30,000 when they buy another flat with direct lift access. As with all flat owners, when they take possession of another flat, they are given a grace period of six months to dispose of their existing flat. HDB’s data shows that, generally, those who have purchased another flat with the LHG have no issue selling their existing flat."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00144,2022-04-05-T-008,144,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Should the flat owners need more time to dispose of their existing flat, HDB can grant an extension of time on a case-by-case basis. Flat owners who need further assistance can approach HDB and HDB will see how best to assist them."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00145,2022-04-05-T-008,145,Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00146,2022-04-05-T-008,146,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Thank you, Speaker. Out of the 150 blocks in the whole of Singapore that are segmented, 20% of those, or 30 blocks, are within the Keat Hong ward of the Chua Chu Kang GRC in my constituency. The flats and blocks are more than 30 years old and some of the residents are elderly and I know of one resident of mine who has an adult child who is a stroke patient whom he carries up and down the stairs every time he needs to get to medical appointments. The real distress is there for residents having lived there for many years."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00147,2022-04-05-T-008,147,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I have two questions for the Minister of State. First, whether HDB can consider a different way to assess what is and what is not a benefiting unit for the purposes of an LUP. Because, if you think about it, there are other units that may actually benefit from LUP in the event of a lift breakdown, for example."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00148,2022-04-05-T-008,148,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The second question  I appreciate the answer just now by the Minister of State that HDB is still exploring further solutions, but can HDB determine whether there are any feasible technical solutions conclusively and quickly? And if none is forthcoming, can HDB consider other solutions like purchasing the flat and repurposing it for interim public rental housing, for instance, where the tenants are on a revolving basis and are younger? I ask this because the residents have waited 30 years for LUP and some of them may not survive to wait another 10 more."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00149,2022-04-05-T-008,149,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary question and also for his suggestion. If we look at how we have been doing LUP, we have always only considered the units that do not have direct lift access as the benefiting units of the LUP, since the cost of the LUP has always been shared amongst these units only."
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00150,2022-04-05-T-008,150,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,LUP polls have also always been conducted only amongst these benefiting units.
2022-04-05-T-008-S-00151,2022-04-05-T-008,151,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The current method of counting only the units without direct lift access as benefiting units may thus be, in our view, a cleaner approach. Nevertheless, as I have shared earlier, we thank the Member for his suggestion. We will continue to look at ways to bring down LUP costs and alternatives to improve accessibility of residents living without direct lift access. If the Member has residents who are facing such an issue, I would like to urge the Member to raise it with HDB. He can approach the HDB branch office. We will do our best to explore ways to help the family and the household."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00152,2022-04-05-T-009,152,Abdul Samad,"asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can provide an update on (i) the number of companies that successfully applied for the Capability Transfer Programme since it was first introduced and (ii) its assessment of the programme's effectiveness in terms of helping companies, associations and professional bodies to develop and acquire new capabilities for their Singaporean workforce."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00153,2022-04-05-T-009,153,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what studies have been done on the take-up rate of the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) by the different sectors; (b) how does the Government measure the CTP's success in achieving foreign-to-local skills transfer; and (c) whether the Government has considered imposing conditions on the funding of CTP, such as requiring the applicant company to meet targets for the reduction of foreign labour after a specified period of time."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00154,2022-04-05-T-009,154,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will respond to both Question Nos 17 and 18 on the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) together, so that I can provide a more holistic reply."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00155,2022-04-05-T-009,155,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00156,2022-04-05-T-009,156,Tan See Leng,"Thank you. Since the CTP was introduced in October 2017, more than 140 companies and over 990 locals across more than 20 sectors have benefited or are expected to benefit from the programme. The top three sectors in terms of the number of local trainees are Precision Engineering, Air Transport and Logistics."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00157,2022-04-05-T-009,157,Tan See Leng,"Under the CTP, funding support is provided to companies to acquire global capabilities that are not available in Singapore. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as by  one, bringing foreign specialists into Singapore to train locals in new capabilities; two, sending locals for overseas training attachments; three, facilitating remote capability transfer from foreign specialists; and four, supporting follow-on training in Singapore by local specialists who were trained by foreign specialists or had trained overseas."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00158,2022-04-05-T-009,158,Tan See Leng,"To qualify for funding, companies are required to submit a training plan on the new capabilities to be acquired and the number of local employees who will be trained. This way, we ensure that each CTP project leads to genuine upskilling. For example, the CTP project by SP Services Limited sent 12 local employees to the US to learn about advanced network design and optimisation. Upon their return to Singapore, these employees, in turn, trained 13 other local colleagues. As a result of this project, the local team is now able to take on an expanded job role, performing more advanced tasks, such as fault isolation and data analysis. These were previously jobs that could only be undertaken by contractors."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00159,2022-04-05-T-009,159,Tan See Leng,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked about conditions that are imposed on the CTP. CTP companies are required to commit to training a specific number of locals. As to the suggestion to require that the company reduces its foreign workforce after completing a CTP project, I think it is too blunt an approach. Such conditions would penalise companies that are transferring expertise to locals but, at the same time, still need to grow their overall workforce, both locals and foreigners, to meet growing demand."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00160,2022-04-05-T-009,160,Tan See Leng,"Due to travel restrictions arising from COVID-19, take-up of the CTP has been minimal over the past two years. With the gradual resumption of international travel, we expect more enquiries and applications for the CTP, which has been extended to September 2024."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00161,2022-04-05-T-009,161,Tan See Leng,"CTP is not the only way in which the Government supports firms in capability transfer. Enterprise Singapore’s Global Ready Talent Programme supports Singapore companies in building a young talent pipeline through internships and overseas work opportunities. MOM is also piloting the Global Rotation Scheme, which facilitates the entry of high-potential employees from abroad, on the condition that these same companies post Singaporeans abroad on the same leadership development programme."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00162,2022-04-05-T-009,162,Tan See Leng,"Beyond Government schemes, skills transfer takes place through structured company training programmes, as well as learning from a variety of people, including peers, superiors, customers and suppliers. Workers may also acquire valuable skills through a range of assignments, including overseas postings and even job changes, to gain exposure to different industries or markets."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00163,2022-04-05-T-009,163,Tan See Leng,"We can see that this is reflected in the macro employment data. Resident employment has grown strongly over the past 10 years, driven by PMET jobs which now make up 62.1% of resident workers, compared to 52.7% in 2011. Resident unemployment rates have remained low – they rose during the pandemic but have since recovered to 3.1% as at January 2022. Real median income of full-time resident workers grew an average of 2.6% per year from 2011 to 2021."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00164,2022-04-05-T-009,164,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00165,2022-04-05-T-009,165,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am glad to know from the Minister that there are more sectors now that are benefiting from the CTP – 20 sectors – and, hopefully, we will have more sectors, going forward."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00166,2022-04-05-T-009,166,Saktiandi Supaat,"My question is in regard to my Adjournment Motion which I raised in 2019 on this matter and I am raising it in the Parliamentary Question as well. With regard to the funding support for CTP, I had suggested before whether we can consider expanding CTP to support the transfer of capabilities from foreign employees currently already employed in Singapore to local employees, with the eventual aim of localising jobs, working in tandem with the localisation targets I mentioned back in the Adjournment Motion. This is because the current funding support of CTP only applies to incoming foreign specialists. So, I hope the Minister can answer my question here, whether we can consider expanding CTP to support transfer of capabilities from foreign employees currently already employed in Singapore to local workers."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00167,2022-04-05-T-009,167,Tan See Leng,"I thank the Member for his suggestion. It is something that we, certainly, will look into closely. I think the appreciation of the fact that this has to be a very tightly-scoped funding support structure is important in making sure that capability transfers are effected and also effective, so that our local employees can gain the maximum amount of expertise and skillsets from this particular programme. I think this is of paramount importance to us."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00168,2022-04-05-T-009,168,Tan See Leng,"So, perhaps, a broad summary of how we think in terms of the extension of funding support. Support levels will be determined by WSG in consultation with the relevant sector agencies. Today, CTP projects can receive up to 90% funding and the co-funding ratio will depend on the impact of the CTP project, and whether, of course, the entity that is applying is an SME or non-SME, or organising the programme on an industry-wide level."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00169,2022-04-05-T-009,169,Tan See Leng,"Today, the funding rates, the different levels of support, serve and exist to differentiate the level of support based on the assessed impact of each project. We also have to ensure that there is some degree of co-funding from the participating company or the industry."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00170,2022-04-05-T-009,170,Speaker,Mr Abdul Samad.
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00171,2022-04-05-T-009,171,Abdul Samad,"Thank you, Sir. I just have one supplementary question. Can MOM consider a higher funding for companies intending to embark on CTP and may also engage the unions through our Company Training Committee for a more balanced assessment, to ensure that there is a structured plan for a transfer of capabilities?"
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00172,2022-04-05-T-009,172,Tan See Leng,"I thank the Member for his suggestion. We are not closed to anything. But I think let me set the perspective. Thus far, since the programme began till now, WSG has not received any feedback from interested companies that the existing support rates or the project funding cap of S$300,000 is restrictive. So, we will continue to monitor the take-up of the scheme."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00173,2022-04-05-T-009,173,Tan See Leng,"It is something that we have started for quite a number of years. Certainly, companies have benefited and, like I said, 990 locals, close to about 1,000, have also benefited or will be benefiting from the programme. In the absence of additional feedback, unless Mr Abdul Samad is suggesting that there are instances where he finds that the funding cap of S$300,000 is restrictive, it is something that we can look to review."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00174,2022-04-05-T-009,174,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00175,2022-04-05-T-009,175,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister. I think this is a subject I spoke about in my Budget speech last year as well, seeking details on the number of individual Singaporeans who have benefited from CTP."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00176,2022-04-05-T-009,176,Pritam Singh,"In view of the revision or the review of the ITMs towards ITM 2025, does CTP feature very prominently in the review? Because as I mentioned last year, my view is it can be an important conduit through which locals upskill effectively with new skills that have a direct knock-on effect on their companies and, of course, on enterprise, in general."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00177,2022-04-05-T-009,177,Pritam Singh,My second question is specifically on the 990 locals and the 140 companies that the Minister spoke of earlier. How many of them received the highest cap of funding at 90%?
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00178,2022-04-05-T-009,178,Tan See Leng,"The CTP is one of the multitude of programmes that we have available in ensuring that we are able to nuance the JTM to match what we have actually set out to achieve under our ITMs. I believe that the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Gan Kim Yong, will provide an update in terms of the effectiveness of the programmes at a later stage."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00179,2022-04-05-T-009,179,Tan See Leng,"Suffice to say, we have got a whole host of other programmes like the Company Training Committee (CTC) programme administered by NTUC. Then, WSG works on the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) in helping many of our mid-career job-seekers who want to switch careers. So, it is one of the many programmes that we have available."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00180,2022-04-05-T-009,180,Tan See Leng,"As far as the numbers in terms of the 140 companies and the 990 locals are concerned, how much of the funding of up to 90% we have been able to accord, at this particular point in time, I do not have the numbers, but I am happy to provide the details subsequently."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00181,2022-04-05-T-009,181,Tan See Leng,"One other point, and I hope that the Leader of the Opposition may want to take note, is that in the last two years during COVID-19, because of border restrictions, the number of companies applying for this particular programme to allow either their employees to go overseas for training or to bring foreign expertise here, has been significantly curtailed. Hence, that speaks for the very low take-up rate over the last two years."
2022-04-05-T-009-S-00182,2022-04-05-T-009,182,,"But as border controls ease, as we start opening up, I would expect that the numbers would start to go up again, all the way until the end of the programme in 2024."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00183,2022-04-05-T-010,183,Desmond Choo,"asked  the Prime Minister as ""Buy Now Pay Later"" (BNPL) schemes have rapidly gained traction in the past year (a) what is the total value of BNPL transactions in Singapore in 2021; (b) whether there are plans for BNPL companies and schemes to be regulated; and (c) whether BNPL schemes have disproportionately affected younger consumers in being over-leveraged."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00184,2022-04-05-T-010,184,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, “Buy Now Pay Later”, or BNPL, transactions have constituted a very small fraction of total consumer payments to date. Last year, BNPL transactions amounted to around $440 million, which is less than 0.5% of the $103 billion in credit and debit card payments."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00185,2022-04-05-T-010,185,Alvin Tan,"BNPL schemes offered in Singapore, currently, do not pose significant risks of consumer indebtedness. Some common features of BNPL schemes limit the extent of debt accumulation by consumers. For example, BNPL providers typically suspend users from making further BNPL purchases once a payment is overdue. BNPL schemes also do not charge compounding interest on the outstanding amount and cap the amount of late fees levied. The risk of rapid debt accumulation by consumers through BNPL schemes is, hence, not large."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00186,2022-04-05-T-010,186,Alvin Tan,"All BNPL providers in Singapore have also set a minimum account opening age requirement of at least 18. In fact, those who are 25 years or older account for more than 85% of BNPL users here and more than 90% of total BNPL transaction values."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00187,2022-04-05-T-010,187,Alvin Tan,"MAS is, nonetheless, closely monitoring the BNPL sector as such borrowings have the potential to grow rapidly. We are studying the experience of other countries where BNPL schemes have taken off more strongly."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00188,2022-04-05-T-010,188,Alvin Tan,"For now, MAS has assessed that effective industry self-regulation, through an industry code, should adequately mitigate the risks in the BNPL sector. Under MAS’ guidance, the Singapore FinTech Association has launched a BNPL Working Group to develop a code of conduct for all BNPL providers."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00189,2022-04-05-T-010,189,Alvin Tan,"This code, which we expect will be launched in the second half of this year, will seek to mitigate the risk of consumer over-indebtedness and establish minimum safeguards to ensure that consumer interests are well-protected while using BNPL schemes. MAS will continue to guide the progress of the BNPL Working Group and monitor developments in this space."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00190,2022-04-05-T-010,190,Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00191,2022-04-05-T-010,191,Desmond Choo,"Mr Speaker, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister of State. BNPLs are, essentially, unsecured loans. The consumer can purchase across multiple shopping sites and use multiple BNPL facilities provided by different providers. Should there not be a limit to how much a person can utilise such facilities?"
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00192,2022-04-05-T-010,192,Desmond Choo,"BNPL also has the propensity to encourage spending beyond one's means, especially because BNPL payments are charged to a buyer's credit card so there is double leverage. Can MAS consider making credit worthiness checks on BNPL, similar to what it has been doing for credit cards?"
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00193,2022-04-05-T-010,193,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. MAS agrees with the risks highlighted by the Member. As I had mentioned earlier in my response, the BNPL's code of conduct will seek to enshrine unique features of BNPLs which exist today to limit the extent of debt accumulation by users."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00194,2022-04-05-T-010,194,Alvin Tan,"In addition, we also expect the code of conduct to incorporate minimum safeguards for BNPL providers to limit financial imprudence amongst individuals and also to mitigate risks of consumer over-indebtedness."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00195,2022-04-05-T-010,195,Alvin Tan,"MAS is monitoring the progress of the BNPL code and will continue to guide its development, especially in areas where MAS has baseline expectations that need to be met within the code."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00196,2022-04-05-T-010,196,Alvin Tan,"At this point of time, I want to quickly just share on what consumers may do while we are still working with the SFA on this code."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00197,2022-04-05-T-010,197,Alvin Tan,"As with undertaking any financing of any form, consumers should first consider and prioritise their needs over wants when deciding to make a purchase. BNPL schemes and instalment plans should not be used as a way to buy items that are more expensive than what consumers can afford and do not need. By over-stretching finances this way, consumers compromise on their financial goals."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00198,2022-04-05-T-010,198,Alvin Tan,"Consumers should read and understand the terms of any financing schemes, including BNPL schemes, which are fast gaining popularity, before signing up for any of these schemes. In particular, they should be aware of any fees and charges, such as late fees, which are imposed on missed or partial payments. Consumers need to be sure they are able to make payments fully and promptly and factor in whether they can bear the consequences of failing to do so."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00199,2022-04-05-T-010,199,Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00200,2022-04-05-T-010,200,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have one supplementary question. The Consumers Association of Singapore is concerned with the risk posed by the BNPL scheme, especially when the consumer is unable to service the payment instalments."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00201,2022-04-05-T-010,201,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"So, while I can understand that the Government needs time to study the evolving BNPL landscape and consider its regulatory approach, I would like to ask will MAS consider including advertising curbs in the proposed code that it is studying right now, similar to that which is imposed on cryptocurrency. This is so as to prevent BNPL schemes from preying on impressionable youths."
2022-04-05-T-010-S-00202,2022-04-05-T-010,202,Alvin Tan,I thank the Member for his question. I think it is a very important point. And I also encourage the Member and CASE also to work together with the Singapore FinTech Association and the Working Group to explore some of the suggestions that he has made.
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00203,2022-04-05-T-011,203,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there has been an uptick of unlicensed moneylending cases being reported since October 2021 when Singapore's inflation rate started increasing; and (b) what proactive steps have been identified to ensure that unlicensed moneylenders do not take advantage of the inflationary pressures to exploit vulnerable people.
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00204,2022-04-05-T-011,204,Desmond Tan,"Mr Speaker, we have not detected an uptick in unlicensed moneylending, or UML, cases since October 2021. Between October and December 2021, there were 917 cases of UML and UML-related harassment cases reported. This was an 8% decrease, compared to the same period in 2020."
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00205,2022-04-05-T-011,205,Desmond Tan,"The Police take a tough stance against UML activities. In 2021, the Police conducted 11 major enforcement operations and investigated a total of 1,682 subjects. The Police also actively work and share information with foreign enforcement agencies to dismantle UML syndicates that are operating from outside of Singapore. In addition, the Police work closely with the banks to disrupt the operations of UML syndicates."
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00206,2022-04-05-T-011,206,Desmond Tan,Police have also been enhancing outreach efforts to educate the public against borrowing from or working for unlicensed moneylenders. The Police are planning a new run of the anti-UML campaign to educate and remind the members of public on the perils of borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders.
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00207,2022-04-05-T-011,207,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00208,2022-04-05-T-011,208,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Minister of State for his reply. I am glad to note that the Police are starting the anti-UML campaign now."
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00209,2022-04-05-T-011,209,Murali Pillai,"Given the higher inflationary pressures that we now face, I wonder if the Police would proactively monitor ads through SMS text messages, WhatsApp messages and Telegram and other similar platforms to see whether these ads are from unlicensed moneylenders and, if so, proactively stop the circulation of these ads."
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00210,2022-04-05-T-011,210,Desmond Tan,"I thank the Member for the suggestion. Indeed, the Police do monitor the current trends, but I would like to, first of all, say that we think the current situation of unlicensed moneylenders is under control."
2022-04-05-T-011-S-00211,2022-04-05-T-011,211,Desmond Tan,We will continue to look at how we can strengthen our levers and also on measures to educate the members of public on the perils of unlicensed moneylender borrowing and also monitor the modes in which unlicensed moneylenders are using to transmit the advertisements and promotion through different means.
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00212,2022-04-05-T-012,212,Speaker,Minister Shanmugam.
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00213,2022-04-05-T-012,213,K Shanmugam,"Sir, thank you for allowing me to clarify in the interest of accuracy. I think it is important that we are accurate to this House."
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00214,2022-04-05-T-012,214,K Shanmugam,"Going back to Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, he said today, ""It is useful for me to clarify that the specific Parliamentary Question that I had posed last year mentioned specifically non-violent offenders, of which are in a number of categorisations, including sexual crimes and misdemeanours. It is a bit of a mischaracterisation to argue to let paedophiles back into the system."""
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00215,2022-04-05-T-012,215,K Shanmugam,"So, he is suggesting that, last year, his Parliamentary Question (PQ) excluded sexual crimes and misdemeanours. That is not true. The PQ specifically last year said  to ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Government will consider expanding the coverage of the Yellow Ribbon project such that ex-offenders of non-violent crimes will, contingent on an extended period of good behaviour following successful re-integration in society, be eligible for the elimination of their criminal history from public records and hence not report this record for employment purposes. [Please refer to ""Expanding Coverage of Yellow Ribbon Project to Include Ex-offenders of Non-violent Crimes"", Official Report, 2 February 2021, Vol 95, Issue 17, Written Answers to Questions section.]"
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00216,2022-04-05-T-012,216,K Shanmugam,"Sexual crimes were not excluded if they were non-violent, nor were misdemeanours excluded if they were non-violent. My comments, both last year and this year, were based on what Assoc Prof Jamus Lim then asked and suggested, rather than what he thinks he now has asked. That is the first point."
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00217,2022-04-05-T-012,217,K Shanmugam,The second point  Members will remember the case of Mr Robinson who sent across sexually explicit images to try and groom a child; it is non-violent. You want him to be in a childcare centre or serve as a security officer?
2022-04-05-T-012-S-00218,2022-04-05-T-012,218,K Shanmugam,"So, let us be careful and let us also be clear what we said and what we did not say in Parliament."
2022-04-05-T-013-S-00219,2022-04-05-T-013,219,Gan Thiam Poh,asked  the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many Singaporean and Permanent Resident (PR) households currently have electricity and water bills in arrears respectively; (b) how many of these cases have measures taken to regulate their use of water; and (c) whether the existing practice to offer Pay-as-You-Use (PAYU) scheme can be expanded to cover the use of both electricity and water.
2022-04-05-T-013-S-00220,2022-04-05-T-013,220,Desmond Tan,"Mr Speaker, there are approximately 13,000 households which have electricity accounts in arrears and 150,000 households which have water bills in arrears. Of these 150,000 households, about 1,200 have arrears of at least $250. ["
2022-04-05-T-013-S-00221,2022-04-05-T-013,221,Desmond Tan,"The Pay-as-You-Use, or PAYU, scheme is currently offered to electricity customers who have accumulated at least $400 of overdue payment. Under the PAYU scheme, households would have to pre-pay for credits to use electricity and 20% of the credit payment would go towards settling outstanding arrears."
2022-04-05-T-013-S-00222,2022-04-05-T-013,222,Desmond Tan,"Since August 2021, PUB has commenced a trial to implement the PAYU scheme for water. Fifty households are currently participating in this trial. Similar to the electricity PAYU scheme, households under the water PAYU scheme will be able to access water at the normal flow rate through pre-paying for credits, 20% of which goes towards settling their arrears. PUB will continue to gather data from the trial, before making a decision on whether to extend the scheme to more households."
2022-04-05-T-013-S-00223,2022-04-05-T-013,223,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. The Clerk will proceed to read the Order of the Day and Notice of Motion.

2022-04-05-T-014-S-00226,2022-04-05-T-014,226,,[(proc text) Question again proposed. (proc text)]
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00227,2022-04-05-T-014,227,Speaker,Mr Yip Hong Weng.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00228,2022-04-05-T-014,228,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as a global financial hub, Singapore must stay abreast of the rapidly evolving financial landscape. Today, technology has led to a rapid increase and innovation in new financial products and assets. Conversely, the risks and challenges of managing these products and assets as well as the financial institutions and persons involved have also heightened."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00229,2022-04-05-T-014,229,Yip Hon Weng,I support the consolidation and enhancement of the regulatory powers under this Bill to address the challenges. I believe that this will lead to a more holistic and comprehensive management of the financial services sector. I have several queries on the Bill.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00230,2022-04-05-T-014,230,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister provide further clarification on the Harmonised and Expanded Powers to Issue Prohibition Orders, or PO?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00231,2022-04-05-T-014,231,Yip Hon Weng,"If a person has been placed on a watchlist or issued something of equivalence to our PO by an overseas jurisdiction, would they be issued a PO here by default? This will facilitate various national regulators to better work together to maintain the integrity of global markets."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00232,2022-04-05-T-014,232,Yip Hon Weng,"The Bill also states that persons who have been issued a PO may be, amongst other things, prohibited from becoming a substantial shareholder of a financial institution. Will it be an offence to wilfully assist the PO individual to evade the PO?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00233,2022-04-05-T-014,233,Yip Hon Weng,"Even with the PO, it is not difficult for seasoned fraudsters to set up their theatre here, with actors and props in tow. Take, for example, the recent case of a blockchain company that is being investigated for cheating offences. One of the key personnel was previously convicted for commercial crimes."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00234,2022-04-05-T-014,234,Yip Hon Weng,"Usually, these cases only come to light after some of our citizens are cheated by these individuals. Such incidents would make a mockery of our regulators in the way we oversee such theatrics."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00235,2022-04-05-T-014,235,Yip Hon Weng,"More than just putting up regulations and by-laws, we should look at the gaps in how we allow businesses to get registered. Ever so often, we hear of bank account holders being flagged up and put through a lot of queries over the sources of funds in their own bank accounts while the real sharks swim away after gnawing an arm or a leg."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00236,2022-04-05-T-014,236,Yip Hon Weng,"In sum, we need a more proactive enforcement of our laws and licensing conditions. This has to be in addition to more effective oversight and not just closer monitoring of our financial institutions."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00237,2022-04-05-T-014,237,Yip Hon Weng,"Notwithstanding the above, I am pleased that the Bill, in its provisions, for example, clause 174, expressly allows for the prosecution of directors and individuals involved in the management of the corporation for offences committed by corporations. This is a clear signal to fraudsters that there is no hiding behind the corporate veil. It is also broad enough to prosecute fraudsters who often avoid registering themselves as officers of corporations."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00238,2022-04-05-T-014,238,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, can we further enhance and streamline the regulation of virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, to better manage money laundering and terrorists financing risks, or AML/CFT?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00239,2022-04-05-T-014,239,Yip Hon Weng,"I note that MAS does not intend to regulate non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, for now. However, the NFT market is vulnerable to money laundering activities."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00240,2022-04-05-T-014,240,Yip Hon Weng,"In a recent study, the US Treasury Department revealed that NFTs may become a tool for money laundering in the high-value art market. Recent sales of high-profile art pieces involving NFTs have sold for millions, indicating that this art sector has reached similar valuations as traditional art mediums."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00241,2022-04-05-T-014,241,Yip Hon Weng,"These art sectors using NFTs are popular vehicles for illicit financial flows. NFTs can even be used to conduct self-laundering. In this scenario, criminals may purchase a NFT with illicit funds and proceed to transact with themselves to create records of sales on the blockchain and wash the cash clean."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00242,2022-04-05-T-014,242,Yip Hon Weng,"I have asked several NFT-related Parliamentary Questions previously, given these concerns. Member Derrick Goh had also spoken about this yesterday."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00243,2022-04-05-T-014,243,Yip Hon Weng,Can the Ministry clarify how the possible risks of AML/CFT through NFTs are addressed under this Bill? Can NFTs be brought into the definition of virtual assets so that the new rules will be applied equally to NFTs?
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00244,2022-04-05-T-014,244,Yip Hon Weng,I note the specification that the Bill covers VASPs created in Singapore or carrying on business of providing digital token services from a place of business in Singapore. What about foreign digital token services which provide virtual assets activities within Singapore?
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00245,2022-04-05-T-014,245,Yip Hon Weng,"I would also propose that we further streamline the capture of licensees under this Bill. MAS has explained that if a VASP is already licensed, exempted from licensing or required to be licensed under the relevant provisions in the Securities and Futures Act, Financial Advisers Act or Payment Services Acts, then it need not be licensed under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA). Is it not possible to consolidate all of these licences under one omnibus Act?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00246,2022-04-05-T-014,246,Yip Hon Weng,"Third, Mr Speaker, Sir, how often will the maximum penalty of $1 million be meted out for technology risk management lapses?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00247,2022-04-05-T-014,247,Yip Hon Weng,The technology sector progresses rapidly and funds flow in copious amounts daily. A 2018 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report stated that projected cyber attacks were costing financial institutions at least $100 billion globally on an annual basis. This figure would likely have risen with the sharp rise in technology progression and cybersecurity breaches in recent years.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00248,2022-04-05-T-014,248,Yip Hon Weng,"In this connection, financial institutions often have significant funds. Also, inflation would degrade the deterrent effect of a fixed financial penalty. As such, how often will the range of financial penalties set out in the Bill be amended?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00249,2022-04-05-T-014,249,Yip Hon Weng,"Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, will there be exceptions where the statutory protection will not be in effect, even with the absence of wilful misconduct, negligence, fraud or corruption?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00250,2022-04-05-T-014,250,Yip Hon Weng,"I support the provision of Statutory Protection from Liability clauses in the Bill. This will encourage mediators, adjudicators and dispute resolution employees to conduct their duties with greater confidence and autonomy, which are important for successful mediation."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00251,2022-04-05-T-014,251,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, as a top financial services centre and fintech innovation hub, we must stay ahead of the various challenges and developments in the industry. Singapore has built up a strong global reputation for reliability and resilience. This remains unwavering even in the face of recent global crises."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00252,2022-04-05-T-014,252,Yip Hon Weng,Swarths of capital and data from all over the world flow through our nation every day. We must continue to review our legislation on a regular basis to ensure that they remain robust and adequately comprehensive to support developments in our finance sector. I support the Bill.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00253,2022-04-05-T-014,253,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00254,2022-04-05-T-014,254,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, this Bill consolidates and increases MAS' powers. In doing so, it empowers MAS to take a comprehensive sector-wide approach to risk management and enforcement action."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00255,2022-04-05-T-014,255,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I thank MAS for holding a public consultation in preparation for this Bill in January 2020 and for incorporating some of the feedback into the Bill. I have three points of clarification to raise.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00256,2022-04-05-T-014,256,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My first point is on the checks and balances against MAS' issuance of prohibition orders, or POs. The Bill allows MAS to issue POs to persons based on MAS' fit and proper criteria. POs are extremely powerful. They restrict things as significant as shareholdings and as granular as business activity. They can end livelihoods and shut down companies. Given the drastic nature of this enforcement action, it seems fair that MAS should, at least, explain the basis of such actions."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00257,2022-04-05-T-014,257,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My question is this  why does the Bill not require MAS to publish an explanation for its imposition of POs? Clause 11 requires MAS to only give notice for and publish the PO. But it is entirely optional for MAS to explain its decision. In my view, MAS should be required to explain the rationale of its decision. It should, at least, state the category of fit and proper test criteria that the person has failed. To begin with, it seems only fair that we tell people why they are being punished. In addition, it would strengthen the mechanisms of accountability."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00258,2022-04-05-T-014,258,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The Bill imposes two checks on MAS' issuance of POs. First, MAS is obligated to hear out the subject of the PO. Second, the person can write an appeal to the Minister for Finance. In both cases, the process of justice would be strengthened if the person knows what he is being punished for. For example, if MAS explains that its PO is being issued due to a person's lack of financial soundness rather than due to dishonesty, that person could then present relevant evidence to the contrary."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00259,2022-04-05-T-014,259,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second point is also about accountability in the issuance of POs. Appeals are one key accountability mechanism for POs. The Bill requires that the Minister considers the written report of the appeal advisory committee when deciding on these appeals. Can the Minister share why the committee's written report is not required to be published for the public?
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00260,2022-04-05-T-014,260,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The committee has broad disruptive powers. They can summon anyone to give evidence on oath and to produce any documents deemed necessary. The committee's work thus affects not only the person issued the PO but also, potentially, a whole array of other people. Given the extensive impact of the committee's work, it is not clear why their report should be shrouded in secrecy. Publication of their written report would provide important context on the Minister's decision and ensure that these inquiries are held in a professional and appropriate way."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00261,2022-04-05-T-014,261,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My final point is on notices provided to financial institutions for POs issued and varied. MAS has stated that it will directly notify a person who is subject to the PO as well as the person's employer of the PO issued. Can the Minister clarify whether MAS will also notify the individual's employer if the individual's PO is later varied?
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00262,2022-04-05-T-014,262,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In addition, how will MAS help ensure that financial institutions are notified in a timely manner when their service providers are issued a PO or have their PO varied? After all, financial institutions, typically, conduct due diligence checks on their service providers only at specific junctures. Until they conduct such checks, they may not know that their service providers have been issued POs or have had their POs varied. It will be helpful to financial institutions if MAS can ensure PO issuances and variations are promptly communicated to financial institutions."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00263,2022-04-05-T-014,263,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00264,2022-04-05-T-014,264,Speaker,Minister of State Alvin Tan.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00265,2022-04-05-T-014,265,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who have shared their views on the Bill and for their support for it. Members' comments and queries can be categorised into a few buckets and I will address them in turn."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00266,2022-04-05-T-014,266,Alvin Tan,"Mr Don Wee, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Yip Hon Weng and Ms Janet Ang have raised questions on the scope of regulation of digital assets. Let me deal with these collectively."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00267,2022-04-05-T-014,267,Alvin Tan,"MAS adopts a technology-neutral regulatory approach that focuses on the nature of the activity and the risks involved. VASPs, or what we term as digital token service providers in Singapore, DT service providers, are, therefore, regulated, based on the type of activity they conduct."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00268,2022-04-05-T-014,268,Alvin Tan,"Correspondingly, where DT service providers deal in digital payment tokens, this could be a payment activity under the Payment Services Act. Where they deal in or provide financial advice on capital market products, their activity would fall under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) or the Financial Advisers Act (FAA)."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00269,2022-04-05-T-014,269,Alvin Tan,These Acts are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain fit-for-purpose and are in line with international norms.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00270,2022-04-05-T-014,270,Alvin Tan,"In most cases, DT service providers that incorporate or establish a place of business in Singapore do so to provide DT services in Singapore. They will be subject to the laws in Singapore. Similarly, foreign DT service providers that provide DT services in Singapore will also be subject to the laws in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00271,2022-04-05-T-014,271,Alvin Tan,"Some of these businesses may also provide services in foreign markets and they would be expected to adhere to the rules that apply in the foreign markets where they operate. For instance, DT service providers that provide services in relation to capital market products in foreign countries would be subject to the rules imposed by the capital market regulators in the foreign countries concerned."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00272,2022-04-05-T-014,272,Alvin Tan,"MAS has cooperation arrangements with foreign regulators to ensure effective cross-border regulation. This approach is similar to the regulation of traditional capital market products that are not tokenised. It is, generally, not necessary to impose additional requirements on a business that is created and operating in Singapore if it does not provide services in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00273,2022-04-05-T-014,273,Alvin Tan,"Nonetheless, we recognise that there may be reputational risks to Singapore in respect of DT service providers created in Singapore but that provide DT services overseas – for instance, those involved in digital payment token or cryptocurrency activities, if they are found to facilitate money laundering activities."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00274,2022-04-05-T-014,274,Alvin Tan,"It is for this reason that the new rules, which primarily relate to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing requirements, are proposed in the FSM Bill. I would highlight that the FSM Bill also contains provisions that enable MAS to impose requirements across the financial sector to address money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00275,2022-04-05-T-014,275,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether MAS has considered carving out DT service providers from licensing and regulation under the FSM Bill if they are already regulated in another jurisdiction which enforces the FATF standards. Ms Janet Ang raised a similar question as well. There may be differences in the implementation and enforcement of these standards even as countries accept and adopt the enhanced FATF standards. DT service providers created in Singapore but providing their services outside of Singapore still pose reputational risks to Singapore. Hence, regulating this group of DT service providers under the FSM Bill for ML/TF risks will mitigate these reputational risks."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00276,2022-04-05-T-014,276,Alvin Tan,"Nonetheless, in response to comments made by Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Ms Janet Ang as well as Mr Louis Chua who had also asked about the scope of regulation, it is not the intention of MAS to subject a DT service provider who is regulated under another Act administered by MAS, to regulation under the FSM Bill, in respect of the same DT services. Where the DT service provider is already regulated by MAS under the Payments Services (PS) Act, the SFA or the FAA, for provision of DT services, such an entity does not need to be additionally licensed under the FSM Bill."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00277,2022-04-05-T-014,277,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat spoke also on the need to protect local consumers and markets from risks stemming from digital tokens, including those provided abroad, other than ML/TF risks. Ms Janet Ang also raised concerns over the speculative nature of digital tokens and the need to educate the public. These are all valid concerns."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00278,2022-04-05-T-014,278,Alvin Tan,"MAS has repeatedly warned the public on the risks of investing in digital tokens, such as digital payment tokens or cryptocurrencies, which would include the commonly known Bitcoin, for example. The prices of such digital payment tokens are not anchored on any economic fundamentals and are subject to sharp speculative swings."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00279,2022-04-05-T-014,279,Alvin Tan,"Nonetheless, MAS is aware that there will continue to be people who choose to take these risks. MAS is monitoring the adoption of digital payment tokens in Singapore and will consider if user protection measures are needed. However, even with user protection measures, it is just not possible for laws to protect against investment losses, especially for consumers who choose to seek investment opportunities overseas or online."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00280,2022-04-05-T-014,280,Alvin Tan,"Thus, consumer education and awareness remain key, as the best defence is a discerning public. MAS and relevant Government agencies have been and will continue to raise public awareness, including advising the public to not deal or invest with unregulated entities or investment products."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00281,2022-04-05-T-014,281,Alvin Tan,"On Mr Louis Chua's suggestions relating to marketing activities of digital payment token service providers, MAS has issued guidelines in January this year outlining that digital payment token service providers should not market their services in public areas in Singapore, or engage third parties, such as social media influencers, to do so. They can continue, however, to promote their services on their own corporate website, mobile applications, or official social media accounts. However, they must not portray the trading in digital payment tokens in a manner that trivialises the associated risks. And this complements our continued consumer education efforts I mentioned earlier."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00282,2022-04-05-T-014,282,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked if MAS will consider regulating non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, given its rising popularity and its susceptibility as a vehicle for money laundering. NFTs, in its current form, are often digital representations of arts and other collectibles, which are not financial products subject to MAS regulation. As I have earlier mentioned, the FSM Bill will cover digital tokens that are either  one, a digital payment token; or two, a digital representation of a capital markets product. So, any digital token that meets the characteristics of a digital payment token or a capital market product could be subjected to regulation by MAS."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00283,2022-04-05-T-014,283,Alvin Tan,"In response to Mr Don Wee's point on the need for agencies to better identify criminal activity in this space, MAS has increased surveillance of the digital tokens sector, to identify suspicious networks and higher-risk activities for further supervision, and they have established clear procedures with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) for collaborative enforcement action. All DT service providers must monitor transactions and file suspicious transaction reports with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00284,2022-04-05-T-014,284,Alvin Tan,"To more effectively combat cryptocurrency scams and crimes, the SPF established the Cryptocurrency Task Force in 2018 to monitor the cryptocurrency landscape and also to develop and improve operational procedures in the investigation and seizing of cryptocurrencies and establish working relationships with overseas law enforcement agencies, industry professionals and academic experts in cryptocurrencies. The Cryptocurrency Task Force works closely with MAS and has links with the Association of Crypto Currency Enterprises and Start-ups Singapore (ACCESS), which is a Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Industry Association."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00285,2022-04-05-T-014,285,Alvin Tan,SPF also works with the various cryptocurrency exchanges based locally and abroad to investigate cryptocurrency crimes. SPF takes a serious stance against any person who may be involved in cryptocurrency scams and crimes and perpetrators will be dealt with in accordance with the law.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00286,2022-04-05-T-014,286,Alvin Tan,"Mr Louis Chua then also asked about the progress of licence applications for digital payment token, or DPT, service providers under the PS Act. MAS has received over 580 licence applications to date and has completed the review of close to half of these applications thus far."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00287,2022-04-05-T-014,287,Alvin Tan,"All applications go through a rigorous application process. Applicants will know that MAS sets a high entry bar and commits time and resources to engage the applicants and scrutinise the applications, making sure that they are able to meet the required standards for managing ML/TF and technology risks before we approve their applications. Applications that do not meet the standards or are incomplete will, naturally, need more time to review."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00288,2022-04-05-T-014,288,Alvin Tan,Mr Louis Chua also asked about the travel rule or the value transfer requirements in MAS' Notice PSN02 applicable to DPT service providers. MAS will impose similar AML/CFT requirements to a DT service provider licensed under the FSM Bill.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00289,2022-04-05-T-014,289,Alvin Tan,"Mr Louis Chua asked whether MAS would be inundated with transaction data, given the threshold of $1,500 to obtain certain information of the originator and beneficiary in a value transfer. Contrary to Mr Louis Chua's understanding of the travel rule, there is actually no requirement for the originating DPT service providers to report this information to MAS. Rather, they are required to relay the information to the beneficiary DPT service providers, for them to also conduct necessary screening for nefarious actors. The threshold of $1,500 is also aligned to the international standards for such cross-border transfers."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00290,2022-04-05-T-014,290,Alvin Tan,"Ms Janet Ang also asked if there is a regulatory gap, as financial advisory services related to digital payment tokens offered outside of Singapore will be regulated under the FSM Bill, but the same service offered in Singapore is not regulated under the PS Act. These financial advisory services are provided more often for capital market products and, in this respect, the FSM Bill places the same AML/CFT requirements on them as if they had been offered in Singapore. As for digital payment tokens, we will continue to study whether there is a meaningful presence of service providers that solely provide these advisory services. Where entities provide these services along with other regulated services, such as dealing in, or facilitating the exchange of DPTs, they are already scoped into the PS Act."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00291,2022-04-05-T-014,291,Alvin Tan,"I will next move on to the second bucket which is questions that Members raised related to technology risk management, or TRM."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00292,2022-04-05-T-014,292,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh asked how MAS will weigh the accountability on FIs should negligence fall on the part of their cloud service providers, considering that many FIs have no ability to audit such providers. MAS expects FIs to perform adequate due diligence on all third parties they engage. FIs remain responsible for any disruption that results from their service providers' negligence. And in determining the action to take against an FI, MAS will assess the impact of the breach, the extent to which necessary controls had been implemented to manage the outsourcing risk as well as to comply with MAS' requirements and remediation efforts."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00293,2022-04-05-T-014,293,Alvin Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how often the maximum penalty of $1 million per breach of a TRM requirement will be meted out for TRM lapses. He mentioned that, with inflation, a fixed financial penalty might not be a good deterrent. He also asked how often the financial penalties would be amended."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00294,2022-04-05-T-014,294,Alvin Tan,"In the event of a breach of TRM requirements, MAS will assess the breach to determine the appropriate course of action. A maximum of $1 million could be imposed by the Courts for each breach of MAS' TRM requirements. This means that where there are multiple breaches, the penalty that could be imposed by the Courts on the FI could be higher. This new maximum penalty is a significant increase from the current penalties under the various Acts administered by MAS."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00295,2022-04-05-T-014,295,Alvin Tan,"In addition, MAS has the powers to take other supervisory actions, including requiring FIs to set aside additional regulatory capital until adequate measures have been put in place to address the control lapses or deficiencies. The financial penalty, coupled with the flexibility to impose additional supervisory actions, strikes a balanced approach which signals the importance of having robust TRM without being overly excessive for smaller FIs which Members have also asked about. As with other Acts which MAS administers, MAS will review and adjust the penalty framework under the FSM Bill, as necessary."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00296,2022-04-05-T-014,296,Alvin Tan,Mr Saktiandi Supaat suggested that MAS consider requiring prospective licensees to present adequate cybersecurity plans as a condition for granting licences.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00297,2022-04-05-T-014,297,Alvin Tan,"Currently, when MAS assesses an application for a licence, MAS already considers factors, such as the adequacy of the applicant's cyber hygiene measures, data protection controls and the level of compliance with MAS' TRM guidelines. Applicants that do not meet the requisite requirements will be rejected or given a conditional approval and such applicants will, eventually, still need to meet the requirements before they are allowed to offer their services."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00298,2022-04-05-T-014,298,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat also referred to the PDPC's regulatory approach which considers the culpability of the offender when determining the appropriate enforcement actions. In accordance with MAS' current practice, MAS will take into account the nature of the breach of the TRM requirement, the specific circumstance of each case, the culpability of the offender and then calibrate supervisory action to ensure that they are appropriate and fair."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00299,2022-04-05-T-014,299,Alvin Tan,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim cited the rising trend of scams and the need for a consumer protection law to ensure that FIs do more to protect consumers. The points he raised are not directly related to the Bill but I will briefly address them here.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00300,2022-04-05-T-014,300,Alvin Tan,"On the issue of combating scams, MAS, MCI and MHA have made three Ministerial Statements on 15 February this year to explain how the Government is undertaking a comprehensive approach to counter the threat of phishing scams."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00301,2022-04-05-T-014,301,Alvin Tan,"For the financial sector, Minister Lawrence Wong had elaborated at length on the measures by MAS and the banking industry, including measures that retail banks had implemented immediately and further measures which would be implemented to strengthen banks' ability to deter, detect and combat phishing scams. Minister Lawrence Wong also highlighted that MAS was working with the industry to review the use of SMS to deliver one-time-passwords, or OTPs, and also develop a loss-sharing framework to ensure an equitable sharing of losses for scams, based on the extent to which parties have fulfilled their responsibilities. For the sake of time, I will not repeat the points here."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00302,2022-04-05-T-014,302,Alvin Tan,"On the experiment relating to PayNow, it is stated in the PayNow scheme rules that transaction signing, through the use of OTPs or other two-factor authentication methods, is required for transactions above $1,000. All banks offering PayNow are required to adhere to this. Where a customer has installed and then activated a digital token in his or her mobile banking application, the digital token performs transaction signing in the background of the application, a process that is not obvious to the customer. MAS will reach out to Assoc Prof Jamus Lim to seek clarity on the facts relating to the PayNow experiment and the instance of the credit card limit being exceeded."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00303,2022-04-05-T-014,303,Alvin Tan,"On Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's points in support of a consolidated legislation to address consumer protection, let me clarify that there is no conflict between MAS' supervisory mandate and its role in consumer education and protection. MAS recognises that the core role of the financial sector is to serve the economy, businesses and consumers. To do so, public confidence in financial services and FIs must be safeguarded. MAS sets out both prudential and business conduct standards for FIs, and expect them to operate safely and deal fairly with their customers. Both reinforce public confidence in FIs and the services that they provide."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00304,2022-04-05-T-014,304,Alvin Tan,"MAS has been able to effectively implement these standards and expectations through a mix of legislation, legally binding regulations and notices, as well as guidelines that are specific to the activities and risks in the different segments of the financial sector. This approach ensures that the requirements are relevant for the said regulated activities. For instance, banks are required to implement IT controls to protect customer information from unauthorised access and also the contravention of which can attract penalties."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00305,2022-04-05-T-014,305,Alvin Tan,"Where consumers find themselves in a dispute with an FI that cannot be settled, MAS has provided consumers an avenue to seek recourse at a low-cost independent dispute resolution body – I mentioned yesterday in the FSM Bill – the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd, or FiDReC. Given these, there is no need to have a single consumer protection law for financial services."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00306,2022-04-05-T-014,306,Alvin Tan,But I want to assure the Member that MAS continues to place a high priority on consumer education and protection. The functions that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim spoke of under the Market and Business Conduct Department continue to be taken up by the Market Conduct Policy and Consumer Issues Divisions.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00307,2022-04-05-T-014,307,Alvin Tan,"I will next move on to the prohibition order (PO) framework, of which we received many questions from Members."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00308,2022-04-05-T-014,308,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh asked how proximity will be assessed in determining whether a person has a nexus to the financial industry and whether staff from an FI’s service provider will be subject to a PO. Proximity will be assessed in light of the policy objectives of this new PO powers, namely, to protect the financial industry, customers and investors against persons who have demonstrated, by their misconduct, that they have the potential to cause harm to, or are unsuitable to take up certain roles, activities and functions in the financial industry for which they are prohibited. In response to the example raised by Mr Derrick Goh, outsourced service providers who are individuals, such as those who work for IT vendors and ecosystem partners such as e-commerce platforms, may be subject to a PO."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00309,2022-04-05-T-014,309,Alvin Tan,"MAS recognises that outsourcing arrangements are becoming increasingly prevalent, but also complex, and MAS must be able to issue POs to service providers who have demonstrated by their misconduct that they have the potential to cause harm to the financial industry. Whether a PO will be issued or not always depends on the specific circumstances of a case."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00310,2022-04-05-T-014,310,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh acknowledged that the basis for streamlining the disparate grounds for issuing POs under the SFA, FAA and Insurance Act into a single fit and proper test is sound – so, thank you for that. But he also sought clarification on whether there will be retrospective application of the single fit and proper test for persons with past misconduct that might not have been caught under the three Acts. If so, Mr Derrick Goh also asked whether the PO would commence from the point of misconduct."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00311,2022-04-05-T-014,311,Alvin Tan,"Under this Bill, the new PO powers can be applied to misconduct that took place before the Bill comes into effect. However, the single fit and proper test is not, in substance, a new test but rather, as Mr Derrick Goh acknowledges, streamlines the existing disparate grounds under the three Acts into one single test, based on MAS' guidelines on fit and proper criteria. Thus, if a person's past misconduct would not have been caught under any of the three Acts, it is unlikely that MAS would assess that that person is not fit and proper under the new powers."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00312,2022-04-05-T-014,312,Alvin Tan,"MAS will also continue to apply the old PO powers to cases where Notices of Intent to issue the prohibition order have already been given to the individual. In response to the second question, the present position and the position under the Bill is that a PO will take effect on the date the PO is issued by MAS. A PO will not commence from the point of misconduct."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00313,2022-04-05-T-014,313,Alvin Tan,"Mr Louis Ng asked why the Bill does not require MAS to publish an explanation for the imposition of POs, as it is only fair that people are being told why they are being punished. To clarify, before issuing any PO, MAS will always issue a Notice of Intention to a person informing them that MAS intends to issue a PO against him or her. This Notice of Intention will set out all the material facts and grounds on which MAS has determined that a person is not fit and proper. There is, hence, no unfairness as the person will be fully aware of the basis for which MAS intends to issue a PO against him or her. In any case, the person is given the opportunity to respond by sending representations to MAS. MAS will carefully consider such representations before making its decision whether to issue a PO against the person."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00314,2022-04-05-T-014,314,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Suppat asked if an individual's previous PO can be purged from the records after a specific period of time. Currently, the only public ""record"" of POs issued may be found on MAS' ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage, where all enforcement actions are published for a period of five years, except POs that are of a longer duration than five years. Therefore, where POs are of a shorter duration, the information on the PO will remain on the webpage for a period of five years from the date of publication. Where the PO is longer than five years, the information on the PO will be removed when the PO expires. Effectively, this means that information on POs will not remain on MAS' ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage forever and will be removed from the webpage after five years for POs with a duration shorter than five years, or after the PO expires, where the PO is longer than five years."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00315,2022-04-05-T-014,315,Alvin Tan,"The minimum duration for enforcement actions to remain on the ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage is, therefore, five years. And the duration is fair, because it takes into account  one, the need to send a deterrent message to others that the misconduct justifying the enforcement action – for example, for breaching MAS-administered laws – is a grave matter; and two, the period of five years is also broadly consistent with the period after which a conviction for an eligible crime could also be spent under the Registration of Criminals Act."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00316,2022-04-05-T-014,316,Alvin Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked if a person has been placed on a watchlist or issued something of equivalence to our PO by an overseas jurisdiction, would they be issued a PO here by default. A PO will not be issued by default. While this is a factor that MAS will consider in applying the fit and proper test, MAS will consider all the circumstances of the case, including the facts surrounding why such a person has been placed on a watchlist or the equivalent of a PO, before deciding whether to issue a PO."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00317,2022-04-05-T-014,317,Alvin Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng also mentioned that a person issued with a PO may be prohibited from becoming a substantial shareholder of an FI. In this context, he also asked whether it will be an offence to wilfully assist the PO individual to evade the PO. The answer is  this could amount to an offence. And to be clear, it is an offence for a person who has been issued a PO to contravene the PO. If a third party assists this person to contravene the PO, then the third party could also be liable for abetting the commission of the offence."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00318,2022-04-05-T-014,318,Alvin Tan,"Mr Louis Ng has sought clarification on whether MAS will notify the individual's employer if his PO is varied and how MAS will help to ensure that FIs are notified in a timely manner if their service providers are issued a PO, or have their PO varied. MAS will notify the individual's employer if a PO is issued, and then, correspondingly, also notify an individual's employer if their PO has been varied. MAS will send out these notifications concurrently with the issuance of a PO or a varied PO. This is to ensure that the individual's employer is informed in a timely manner. MAS will consider whether and how to notify FIs if their service providers have been issued a PO or have their POs varied."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00319,2022-04-05-T-014,319,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh asked if existing and incoming foreign talent will be subject to the same due diligence as that of local staff and, if so, whether clearer guidelines on the background checks for foreign talent would be issued. This is because misconduct in non-regulated but critical functions may not be captured in overseas registries."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00320,2022-04-05-T-014,320,Alvin Tan,"Insofar as POs are concerned, the ""due diligence"" and ""background checks"" that would have to be conducted by an FI, whether under the current framework or the new framework, is to ensure that they do not hire individuals who have been issued a PO by MAS to perform the roles or activities that have been prohibited. This applies to both foreign and local employees. FIs can check the MAS' ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage, or write to MAS to enquire whether a particular individual has been issued a PO by MAS."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00321,2022-04-05-T-014,321,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh also mentioned that the Bill has broadened the scope for MAS to issue POs covering activities beyond MAS-administered Acts, including serious misconduct in activities, such as fund management, risk and technology management, which were previously not covered."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00322,2022-04-05-T-014,322,Alvin Tan,"To this end, Mr Derrick Goh has also asked what the severity thresholds for misconduct are, how proportionality of prohibitions is assessed and how culpability for misconduct would be assessed across the ranks, from junior staff to senior management. To clarify, while the Bill does broaden the scope for MAS to issue POs, handling of funds, risk management and administration of critical systems are areas that have an important impact on the soundness and integrity of our financial sector and MAS does exercise regulatory oversight over such areas. MAS has set standards of practice for these functions through the issuance of regulations, notices and guidelines."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00323,2022-04-05-T-014,323,Alvin Tan,"On the question of what the threshold of severity is, or how serious the misconduct must be before a PO is issued, MAS will, generally, take into account factors, such as  one, the harm caused or risks posed by the misconduct; two, whether the misconduct was one-off or continued over a period; three, the reasons why the person carried out the misconduct; and four, public interest and policy considerations."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00324,2022-04-05-T-014,324,Alvin Tan,"On how proportionality of the prohibition is assessed, if Mr Derrick Goh is asking how the duration and scope of a PO is determined, one can expect that the more serious the misconduct is, the longer the duration and wider the scope of the PO are likely to be. Ultimately, each case will be assessed on its own merits, its own facts, taking into account factors that I mentioned previously."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00325,2022-04-05-T-014,325,Alvin Tan,"Finally, being in senior management would not automatically mean a longer or shorter PO period, though, in some cases, the fact that a person was in a senior position and, therefore, a position of higher authority and greater responsibility, may increase his culpability and, therefore, the duration of a PO."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00326,2022-04-05-T-014,326,Alvin Tan,"To respond to Mr Saktiandi Supaat's question on whether an FI would be able to ""shift"" the regulatory burden to its service providers when employing the defence to show that it had taken all reasonable steps to ensure compliance that it has not employed, directly or indirectly, or used the services of a person against whom a PO has been made, there will be no ""shift"" in the regulatory burden as FIs are still, ultimately, responsible for checking that their service providers' relevant employees, who directly or indirectly undertake key functions for or on behalf of the FIs, have not been issued with POs prohibiting them to do so. For an FI to avail itself of the defence, the FI must, minimally, show that they have performed due diligence checks on the employees of its service providers, for example, again, checking the MAS' ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00327,2022-04-05-T-014,327,Alvin Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng also shared that it is not difficult for seasoned fraudsters to set up businesses here and cheat customers, which calls for a more proactive enforcement of our laws. This is in line with what the PO powers are trying to achieve, by pre-emptively and comprehensively keeping known bad actors out of our financial industry."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00328,2022-04-05-T-014,328,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat then asked whether, in addition to the current publication of formal regulatory and enforcement actions taken by MAS on its ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage, MAS intends to create and maintain a public register of POs. This is something that MAS could consider implementing in future, once the new PO powers take effect under the Financial Services and Markets Act. For now, the search function on the ""Enforcement Actions"" webpage may be used by any FI or its agent, to check if a PO is currently in effect against a person. Alternatively, there is also an option for the FI or its agent to contact MAS to obtain records of the POs issued against the person, upon payment of a fee. There is, hence, sufficient means for an FI to determine if an individual has been issued with a PO."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00329,2022-04-05-T-014,329,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat then spoke on the need for clarity in the form of MAS guidance on the specific scope of POs issued in the newly-extended areas. He also asked for data on the number of persons who had previously been issued with a PO and who have thereafter returned to the financial sector. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill sets out clearly the scope of POs which may be issued, which are to prohibit unsuitable persons from certain roles, activities and functions. There is no ambiguity here on the maximum possible scope of a PO."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00330,2022-04-05-T-014,330,Alvin Tan,"In summary, the more serious the misconduct is, the longer the duration, the wider the scope of the PO is likely to be. Nevertheless, as MAS has mentioned before in its response to the public consultation, MAS will be issuing guidelines to provide greater clarity on how the new PO powers will be used. MAS does not monitor whether persons who have previously been issued with a PO return to the financial sector after the PO expires."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00331,2022-04-05-T-014,331,Alvin Tan,"To be clear, a PO only bars an individual from taking up specified roles, functions and activities in the financial industry. An individual is free to take up employment in the financial industry in areas or activities that are not covered by the PO or even outside the financial industry. An individual may choose to find employment in the areas prohibited by the PO when the PO expires. And in such a scenario, it is then up to their prospective employers to determine independently whether or not to hire such a person."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00332,2022-04-05-T-014,332,Alvin Tan,"Mr Derrick Goh has noted that an appeal to the Minister on MAS' decision to issue a PO must be referred to an Appeal Advisory Committee selected from an Appeal Advisory Panel (AAP). He asked about the considerations for ensuring the independence of the AAP and Committee. He also asked whether, in addition to the right of appeal to the Minister, a person may bring his appeal to the Court. On the first question, the members of the AAP will be appointed by the Minister from the financial industry and the public and private sectors, and will have strong credentials which attest to their good judgment and ability to discharge their duties professionally."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00333,2022-04-05-T-014,333,Alvin Tan,"The AAC will comprise any three members from this panel. Under the existing regulations governing appeals to the Minister for PO purposes, the AAC is obliged to declare the nature and extent of all of their conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to the Minister. If the Minister is satisfied that any AAC member is unable to discharge his duties effectively because of any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest, the Minister may replace the AAC member. This will also be the process in appeals to the Minister under the new Act."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00334,2022-04-05-T-014,334,Alvin Tan,"On the second question, a person will be afforded the right to appeal to the Minister under the new Act. This avenue of appeal under the new Act is consistent with the existing practice under the SFA, FAA and IA. However, if a person has exhausted his right of appeal to the Minister and remains unsatisfied with the results, he may still pursue other legal processes which he may be entitled to."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00335,2022-04-05-T-014,335,Alvin Tan,"Mr Louis Ng asked why the AAC's reports are not published publicly. He suggests that, first, this would provide important context on the Minister's decision and, secondly, ensure that the AAC exercises its powers professionally and appropriately."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00336,2022-04-05-T-014,336,Alvin Tan,"On the first aspect, the Minister is not bound by the recommendations in the AAC's report but, rather, exercises his own discretion in deciding on the appeal. The Minister may agree with some of the AAC's assessments while disagreeing with other aspects. He may consider other factors outside the AAC's report. Thus, publishing the AAC's report may not be all that helpful and may even be an inaccurate reflection of the Minister's considerations."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00337,2022-04-05-T-014,337,Alvin Tan,"On the second aspect, as mentioned in response to a previous question by Mr Derrick Goh, the members of the AAP, from which the AAC is constituted, will be appointed by the Minister and will have strong credentials which will attest to their good judgement and ability. If the AAC in any way exercises its powers improperly, the parties can always include this in their submissions, which the Minister will consider."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00338,2022-04-05-T-014,338,Alvin Tan,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked when the new PO regime under the FSM Bill will be brought into effect. This is a matter which MAS is considering carefully. MAS is, currently, preparing for the new PO regime to commence and also intends to give the industry time to prepare for the new PO regime, which includes understanding how the new provisions will be applied. MAS will announce the specific date in due course."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00339,2022-04-05-T-014,339,Alvin Tan,My third bucket is a short one. It is on the provision of statutory protection for personnel of the operator of an approved dispute resolution scheme. Mr Yip Hon Weng asked if there will be exceptions to this.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00340,2022-04-05-T-014,340,Alvin Tan,"For statutory protection to be accorded, the mediator, adjudicator or employee must have acted with reasonable care and in good faith. This will have to be determined, based on the facts and circumstances of each case."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00341,2022-04-05-T-014,341,Alvin Tan,"Finally and lastly, there are a whole host of different inquiries which I will bucket into this last segment. Ms Janet Ang asked broadly about MAS' plans to enhance the skills and competencies required in the financial services ecosystem."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00342,2022-04-05-T-014,342,Alvin Tan,"MAS works closely with the industry, such as the Institute of Banking and Finance, to develop the workforce in the financial sector. To seize opportunities for growth, we are always on the lookout for new growth drivers, including from the digitalisation wave. To meet the new job demands, we also have multiple training pathways to reskill and upskill our financial sector talent."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00343,2022-04-05-T-014,343,Alvin Tan,Ms Janet Ang and Mr Louis Chua asked broadly about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00344,2022-04-05-T-014,344,Alvin Tan,"As Ms Janet Ang mentioned, MAS recently collaborated with the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and several other central banks on a project known as Project Dunbar to explore a common platform for cross-border interbank payments using CBDCs. Very briefly, Project Dunbar proved that financial institutions (FIs) could use CBDCs issued by participating central banks to transact directly with one another on a shared platform."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00345,2022-04-05-T-014,345,Alvin Tan,"This has the potential to reduce reliance on intermediaries and, correspondingly, the costs and time taken to process cross-border transactions, and is part of the journey that MAS has been embarking on with the industry and other central banks over the few years to explore the potential benefits and feasibility of adopting wholesale CBDC for global payments."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00346,2022-04-05-T-014,346,Speaker,"Order. Minister of State, may I ask if you will be going on further?"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00347,2022-04-05-T-014,347,Alvin Tan,"Just a few more lines, Mr Speaker."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00348,2022-04-05-T-014,348,Speaker,"You have one and a half minutes left. If you can wrap up within one and a half minutes, then I will not ask the Leader to extend."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00349,2022-04-05-T-014,349,Alvin Tan,"Yes, I will wrap up within one and a half minutes."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00350,2022-04-05-T-014,350,Speaker,Thank you.
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00351,2022-04-05-T-014,351,Alvin Tan,"The details and conclusions of the project, you can find on the BIS website."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00352,2022-04-05-T-014,352,Alvin Tan,"Ms Janet Ang also mentioned that it would be useful for MAS to publish the clarifications and discussions that arose during the consultation process. MAS has published on its website the responses of the feedback. So, you can find them on our website."
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00353,2022-04-05-T-014,353,Alvin Tan,"Finally, Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether the FSM Bill is the first step in a broader exercise to rationalise Singapore's regulations on a financial sector-wide basis. MAS regularly reviews its Acts to ensure —"
2022-04-05-T-014-S-00354,2022-04-05-T-014,354,Speaker,"Order. Leader. Just on the safe side, let us extend."
2022-04-05-T-015-S-00355,2022-04-05-T-015,355,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that the proceedings on the item under discussion be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order 48(8) to remove the time limit in respect of Minister of State Alvin Tan's speech?"
2022-04-05-T-015-S-00356,2022-04-05-T-015,356,Speaker,I give my consent. Does the Leader of the House have the general assent of hon Members present to so move?

2022-04-05-T-016-S-00361,2022-04-05-T-016,361,Speaker,Minister of State Alvin Tan.
2022-04-05-T-016-S-00362,2022-04-05-T-016,362,Alvin Tan,"Thank you, Leader. Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is a chunky Bill; I am almost at the end."
2022-04-05-T-016-S-00363,2022-04-05-T-016,363,Alvin Tan,"I was about to say that the MAS regularly reviews its Acts to ensure that the regulation of the financial sector continues to be efficient and effective. It is possible that some of the existing powers in various MAS-administered Acts may be harmonised in the FSM Bill in the future if MAS is of the view that such an approach would enable it to address financial sector-wide risks more effectively. With this, I beg to move, Sir."
2022-04-05-T-016-S-00364,2022-04-05-T-016,364,Speaker,Any clarifications?
2022-04-05-T-016-S-00365,2022-04-05-T-016,365,Speaker,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2022-04-05-T-017-S-00369,2022-04-05-T-017,369,Speaker,Minister Josephine Teo.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00370,2022-04-05-T-017,370,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, ""That this House endorses Paper Cmd 15 of 2022 on 'White Paper on Singapore Women's Development' as our whole-of-nation plan of action to collectively advance Singapore women's development to build a fairer and more inclusive society, where women and men partnering each other as equals can pursue their aspirations freely and to the fullest."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00371,2022-04-05-T-017,371,Josephine Teo,"Sir, this is the first time that the Government has presented a White Paper on Women’s Development for Parliament to debate. This fact alone is significant."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00372,2022-04-05-T-017,372,Josephine Teo,"But more than that, before embarking on this Paper, the Government had initiated a year-long series of nationwide Conversations on Women's Development involving Singaporeans from all walks of life. It did so even as our nation battled a formidable virus which precipitated the worst recession since Independence. This fact is also significant."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00373,2022-04-05-T-017,373,Josephine Teo,The White Paper may have been prepared by the Government but it speaks with the voices of Singaporeans who care deeply about women.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00374,2022-04-05-T-017,374,Josephine Teo,"At the start of our debate, I would like to thank the many partners who have journeyed with us in the past year and a half. They include the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO), the NTUC Women and Family Unit, the PA Women's Integration Network, organisations like Daughters of Tomorrow and Dads for Life."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00375,2022-04-05-T-017,375,Josephine Teo,Some of our partners are here today. May I invite hon Members to join me in showing them our sincere appreciation. [Applause.]
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00376,2022-04-05-T-017,376,Josephine Teo,"We thank each and every one of the participants in the Conversations. You shared your views candidly in the spirit of advancing women's interests. You spoke from your hearts. The Government listened and we heard you. In response, we have put together the first-ever White Paper on Singapore Women's Development, which Parliament will now debate."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00377,2022-04-05-T-017,377,Josephine Teo,How shall we proceed? Where do we begin?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00378,2022-04-05-T-017,378,Josephine Teo,We must begin by recognising that Singapore women have already triumphed over great adversity and made significant progress in so many ways.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00379,2022-04-05-T-017,379,Josephine Teo,"Up till a hundred years ago, women were mostly confined to domesticity. Sons had priority for education and parents decided on their children's marriages. Some women suffered the indignity of being traded like property. As a teenager living in 1930s Singapore, my paternal grandmother, my popo, bore witness to the early winds of change."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00380,2022-04-05-T-017,380,Josephine Teo,"For example, about 700 brothels were closed after the Women and Girls Protection Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlement. In 1932, the same Council banned the sale of young girls to rich families as ""mui tsais"". Women could no longer be deemed chattel, to be bought and sold."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00381,2022-04-05-T-017,381,Josephine Teo,"During the war, many brave and enterprising women did their utmost to help their families and friends survive the cruel ravages of war – rape and murder, persecution and hunger, and untold personal tragedies. There were many heroes – and heroines, too, including Elizabeth Choy."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00382,2022-04-05-T-017,382,Josephine Teo,"After the war, women contributed to the rehabilitation efforts, setting up associations and mutual help groups."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00383,2022-04-05-T-017,383,Josephine Teo,"Soon after we attained self-government, the women of Singapore achieved a historic triumph. On assuming office, almost the first thing the new PAP Government did was to pass the Women's Charter in 1961."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00384,2022-04-05-T-017,384,Josephine Teo,"The Charter institutionalised the rights and responsibilities of men and women in marriage and ensured the protection and welfare of women in Singapore. It also paved the way for greater protection from dangers like family violence and sexual offences. More importantly, it changed the perception of how women should be treated in society and at home. It gave women more autonomy in the roles they took up, fundamentally altering the social compact of its day."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00385,2022-04-05-T-017,385,Josephine Teo,"Back then, only one in three women were literate. But schools for girls established by missionaries, activists, businessmen and intellectuals had already shown what women could do if only we educated them as well as we did men. The trailblazers included Aisha Akbar, who, in 1950, won a scholarship to enter the Trinity College of Music in England. She was only 20 then, and the first in Singapore to be awarded a music scholarship without having already qualified as a music teacher. Ruth Wong, the first woman principal of the Teachers' Training College who later became the founding director of the present-day National Institute of Education (NIE). She helped to transform the teaching profession and uplifted the education system, benefiting generations of girls and boys."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00386,2022-04-05-T-017,386,Josephine Teo,"Free primary education starting in 1960 helped many more Singapore women triumph through education, achieving far more than basic literacy. Today, for every young man enrolled in University, there is a young woman."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00387,2022-04-05-T-017,387,Josephine Teo,"In education alone, we, women, hold up half the sky. We also proved that, with education, we could triumph at the workplace and impact the lives of many others."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00388,2022-04-05-T-017,388,Josephine Teo,"Take, for example, Sudha Nair. She happens to be here today. Sudha studied social work in NUS. Her education led her to start Singapore's first family violence specialist centre, the Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence (PAVE). Even today, PAVE offers valuable services in counselling, public education, research and advocacy."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00389,2022-04-05-T-017,389,Josephine Teo,"Then, there is Juliana Chan, a Singaporean scientist who holds four US patents. Driven by her passion to enhance science communications, Juliana founded the Wildtype Media Group, which has become Asia's leading STEM-focused media company behind publications, such as the Asian Scientist Magazine and Supercomputing Asia."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00390,2022-04-05-T-017,390,Josephine Teo,"We also have Huda Hamid, a businesswoman and social entrepreneur, who has helped single mothers and women from low-income households become financially independent. Huda was one of six winners of the 2020 Young Social Entrepreneurs Global Programme."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00391,2022-04-05-T-017,391,Josephine Teo,"More women have now taken on jobs previously dominated by men and stepped up to leadership roles. Like Sudha, Juliana and Huda, they have proven themselves the equal of their male colleagues."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00392,2022-04-05-T-017,392,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will agree that the women in this Chamber – on both sides of the aisle, the Government as well as the Opposition – have shown the same, too. Never before in our history have we had so many women in Parliament as we do now; and I sincerely believe Parliament is the better for it."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00393,2022-04-05-T-017,393,Josephine Teo,"In the past decade, we have continued to make good progress for Singapore women. Women are now better protected against harms and sexual offences, through the Protection from Harassment Act and Penal Code."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00394,2022-04-05-T-017,394,Josephine Teo,"Women are now better recognised for their contributions in the economy. Our adjusted gender pay gap has further narrowed, halving to around 4% over two decades. Among chief executive officers, women remain a minority, but we are encouraged that Singapore has more than double the global average."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00395,2022-04-05-T-017,395,Josephine Teo,"Caregivers of the elderly and children, majority of whom are women, are now better supported. More facilities and higher subsidies have been made available. Schemes, like Silver Support and the matching of CPF top-ups, help them in retirement."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00396,2022-04-05-T-017,396,Josephine Teo,"Women are living even longer than before. By 2020, Singapore women's life expectancy had reached 86, surpassed only by two countries – Switzerland and Japan."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00397,2022-04-05-T-017,397,Josephine Teo,"And, of course, we now have a woman as our President. As many people noted in the recently released SPH Media book on Singapore’s battle against COVID-19, President Halimah has been a pillar of strength throughout this crisis. She stayed on top of things and struck a balance on difficult decisions, such as tapping into our national reserves."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00398,2022-04-05-T-017,398,Josephine Teo,"By any measure, Singapore women's development has reached a very high base. As a result, we may have felt no urgency to further strengthen the position of women in our society. This Government, however, thought otherwise."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00399,2022-04-05-T-017,399,Josephine Teo,"As I mentioned earlier, almost the first thing the PAP did when it first formed the Government was to pass the Women's Charter."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00400,2022-04-05-T-017,400,Josephine Teo,"Last year was the 60th anniversary of the Women's Charter. We believed it was timely to renew the pledge our founding leaders made so many years ago, to further elevate the position of women in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00401,2022-04-05-T-017,401,Josephine Teo,"This is because, even as we were fighting hard to battle the pandemic, we remembered the daily battles women may still face  the battle with time to fulfil multiple roles and responsibilities; the battle for recognition of the challenges women and girls face, much more than men and boys; the battle with sexual predators who, having been tamed in analogue Singapore, now rear their ugly heads in our digital world; the battle with social expectations on what work we do, what chores we share, what words we say and even what clothes we wear; the battle within ourselves as to how much of ""us"" to give and how much to save for self-care."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00402,2022-04-05-T-017,402,Josephine Teo,"To help women advance, we must not shy away from dealing with these battles."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00403,2022-04-05-T-017,403,Josephine Teo,"On the contrary, we must always see the progress of women as a journey without end, where every achievement is a foundation to aim for new highs. In every generation, we have a duty to find new ways to uplift women. If half of humanity does not progress, how can the rest of humanity?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00404,2022-04-05-T-017,404,Josephine Teo,But where should the weight of our efforts now lie?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00405,2022-04-05-T-017,405,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to advance a proposal for Members to focus the debate on two key elements of the Motion  first, how to further catalyse collective actions; and, second, how to further promote equal partnership between women and men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00406,2022-04-05-T-017,406,Josephine Teo,"In all likelihood, these two lines of effort are the most challenging. Yet, they are also where we have the best hope to really move the needle for our women. I believe this from the bottom of my heart. Let me explain why in Mandarin."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00407,2022-04-05-T-017,407,Josephine Teo,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Like many young working mothers, I struggled with guilt. How could I forgive myself if my child became sicker while I was away on a work trip? How could I forgive myself if my children fell far behind in school or became delinquent because I was not around often enough to guide them?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00408,2022-04-05-T-017,408,Josephine Teo,"At the same time, I also wondered if my boss would notice my divided attention. Would opportunities be redirected because it was assumed I was no longer interested or up to the challenge?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00409,2022-04-05-T-017,409,Josephine Teo,"Last year, when my 82-year-old father suffered a fall and was hospitalised, my mother, herself nearly 80, became his sole caregiver. How could I forgive myself if she, too, became ill from exhaustion?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00410,2022-04-05-T-017,410,Josephine Teo,Questions like these trouble women all the time. I am in no way unique. Almost all the women would find it difficult to balance their family and career at some stage in life.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00411,2022-04-05-T-017,411,Josephine Teo,Part of the answer lies in additional legislative safeguards to uphold fairness at the workplace and also to uphold a more inclusive workplace. The White Paper promises that.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00412,2022-04-05-T-017,412,Josephine Teo,"Part of the solution lies in providing better support to caregivers. The White Paper promises that, too."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00413,2022-04-05-T-017,413,Josephine Teo,"But these efforts taken by the Government can only go so far. No law or tripartite guidelines can dictate the norms in a family, or the detailed practices of workplaces."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00414,2022-04-05-T-017,414,Josephine Teo,"Had my husband not stepped up as an involved father, had my brothers not stepped in to provide relief to my mother, had my father and father-in-law not given their blessings, I could not have continued to work with relative peace of mind, let alone stepped into public life with a degree of confidence."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00415,2022-04-05-T-017,415,Josephine Teo,"Throughout my working life, I was blessed to have bosses like Lim Swee Say and ex-Chairman of EDB Philip Yeo who made room to accommodate personal passions and circumstances."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00416,2022-04-05-T-017,416,Josephine Teo,"Twenty years ago, in the months following the birth of my twins, my former boss Lee Yi Shyan gave permission for me to work from home, long before telecommuting became a formalised policy and telecommunications infrastructure was mature."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00417,2022-04-05-T-017,417,Josephine Teo,I will never forget the trust and the spiritual and practical support I have received from my bosses.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00418,2022-04-05-T-017,418,Josephine Teo,"(In English)  Sir, this is why I firmly believe men's support for equal partnership with women is so important."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00419,2022-04-05-T-017,419,Josephine Teo,"It is also why I firmly believe collective action, beyond what the Government will do, is essential. We can put in place legislation on workplace fairness. But the lived experiences of working women depend on the understanding and support of employers and colleagues. While many Singapore women are empowered by caregiver support, some will continue to be constrained by cultural preferences held by society and even themselves."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00420,2022-04-05-T-017,420,Josephine Teo,"Therefore, more than being a comprehensive plan of action by the Government, the White Paper is a clarion call for each and every one to take action – take action in our homes, our workplaces, our community, our relationships; take action to recognise women's achievements as society's achievements; take action to pursue women's progress as part of society's progress."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00421,2022-04-05-T-017,421,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I have spoken about the many triumphs for women in Singapore. Standing in the Chamber today, these triumphs ring louder than ever."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00422,2022-04-05-T-017,422,Josephine Teo,"In December 1965, when the Parliament of Independent Singapore first sat, there were only two active women out of 64 Members. Today, women occupy 30 out 103 seats, a nine-fold increase in percentage terms."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00423,2022-04-05-T-017,423,Josephine Teo,"Just as our predecessors have laid the foundations for women to succeed, we, too, must build new scaffoldings for future generations of women to thrive. This White Paper reaffirms our shared vision of a fairer and more inclusive society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00424,2022-04-05-T-017,424,Josephine Teo,"This will only happen when men and women partner each other as equals in every domain. It depends on how we, as family members, share in caregiving and act as role models for our children. It depends on how we, as a community, signal our protection and respect for our women. It depends on how we, as employers, empower women colleagues to dream bigger and fly higher."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00425,2022-04-05-T-017,425,Josephine Teo,"Women in Singapore can continue to triumph, not through our words, but our deeds. This is our collective mission. For this reason, I call on everyone to give it our fullest attention and support. Mr Speaker, I beg to move. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00426,2022-04-05-T-017,426,Speaker,Minister Masagos Zulkifli.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00427,2022-04-05-T-017,427,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, it is with great honour that I speak in support of the Motion to advance the progress of Singapore women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00428,2022-04-05-T-017,428,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since Independence, Singapore women have made tremendous progress. Minister Josephine Teo shared about the many remarkable Singaporean women who have laid the foundations of our society. Allow me to share about one woman who has made a great impact on social work development."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00429,2022-04-05-T-017,429,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Across the island, MSF provides a key line of social support in our local communities, enabling families to bounce back – achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility. This is through a network of 48 Family Service Centres (FSCs). This all started with Ms Thung Syn Neo. She was a pioneering social worker, a giant in the profession. Syn Neo spearheaded the formation of the very first FSC in 1978 in the then-Ministry of Social Affairs. We owe Syn Neo our gratitude for laying the foundations of our FSCs, which have uplifted and strengthened thousands of Singaporean families to this day."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00430,2022-04-05-T-017,430,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, the tremendous progress made by our women that we see today did not occur by chance. This was the outcome of the Government’s intentional efforts to steward the progress of Singapore women, decade after decade, because we believe in a fairer and more inclusive society, where men and women are equal, valued members of our society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00431,2022-04-05-T-017,431,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry and the many Ministers that came before me, have been at the forefront of this endeavour. We have led the charge, legislatively, and through our policies and programmes; nudging at times, and earth shaking at times."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00432,2022-04-05-T-017,432,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I was proud to share how far we have come at the G20 Ministerial Conference on Women’s Empowerment in Italy last year. Developing countries had problems providing access to education for their girls, and developed countries complained how their girls were still stereotyped to be educated for roles like teaching and nursing, and few were in STEM. When I shared that, in Singapore, less than 1% of our children did not complete 10 years of education, and that our girls were free to choose their own education pathways, including STEM, the room fell silent – I think in disbelief – that we have achieved both of these."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00433,2022-04-05-T-017,433,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But we should now move from quantitative achievements to one where the quality of development is our focus, which is why we launched the year-long nationwide Conversations on Singapore Women’s Development. We pressed ahead, even amid the pandemic, and organised 160 Conversations. Nearly 6,000 participants, representing wide segments of society, responded to the call and joined us, sharing with us their hopes and aspirations of our women. I was also glad to see many men participating in the Conversations – some of whom are in the Gallery today – because, in the next lap, we can only achieve this goal if we work together, men and women, in a whole-of-society approach."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00434,2022-04-05-T-017,434,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"One of whom said, and I quote, “Men and women both play a part in shaping the society. If we all start to do the right things, the future generation will not have to go through what we went through. We should start now while we still can.” This is one of the big conclusions of the Conversations  the collective responsibility that we, as a society, including we, men, must play, if we want to advance our women’s progress."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00435,2022-04-05-T-017,435,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We must begin with challenging mindsets. This means forging new societal norms – one that is based on respect and partnership. Because only then can we progress further, to truly empower both men and women to pursue their aspirations freely and fully. This requires collective commitment – individuals and families, people, private and public sectors, all segments of society, to step up and walk the talk. In this respect, I believe that we, men, can make a difference for our women and, in the process, for ourselves. Thus, my appeal to all men. We can step up, we can do more and we should. Be role models, not only in words, but also in deeds."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00436,2022-04-05-T-017,436,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Because we must believe in equal partnership between men and women, with respect as its cornerstone. I want to state very clearly that this is not a zero-sum game. From time to time, such beliefs or misperceptions come up, whenever we talk about advancing women’s progress. This is simply not our way. Our approach is not about asserting the rights of one over another."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00437,2022-04-05-T-017,437,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As men, we have a big part to play to encourage equal partnership. In our homes, as fathers, it is our responsibility to teach our sons what it means to respect all women, starting from a young age; instil in them the right values and be role models ourselves through our actions, for them to grow to be gentlemen."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00438,2022-04-05-T-017,438,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our children are social learners of the world, watching our every attitude, word and action. They model after us and assimilate perceived social roles. More tangibly, we can play a much bigger role in sharing the weight of caregiving. We need to pitch in more. Some have, and many more can. Because, in a partnership, we can build on one another’s strengths and be better together, for our children and generations to come. I echo what Bryan Tan, who leads the Centre for Fathering, wrote in a recent commentary that says, and I quote, ""Fathers are not 'substitute mothers'"" and that ""marriage is an equal partnership"", unquote."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00439,2022-04-05-T-017,439,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Allow me to share Saiful’s story. We have cited it in our White Paper, but I thought it is worth reiterating. Seven years ago, Saiful left his job in the creative industry to be a stay-home dad and the need arose because they had a young child in the family. While Saiful’s wife continues to work, she is always there supporting him. Her presence enables him to overcome the challenges that he faces. Saiful’s story is inspiring for two reasons. First of all, not only did he challenge the traditional gender expectations and norms; second, it shows us that when men and women partner together, we become better as one."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00440,2022-04-05-T-017,440,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We honour and respect our women because it is the right and moral thing to do, and this is not something new or just a feature of modern society. Respecting our fellow women is a natural evolution from our values, because we have been nurtured to honour, love and respect the most important woman of our lives – our mothers. We can identify this in an Asian society like ours, culturally or religiously."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00441,2022-04-05-T-017,441,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Chinese know the devotion of Mencius’ Mother, how she single-handedly raised Mencius after her husband passed away, and Mencius’ deep honour and respect that he carried for his mother. One account described the great length and extent that he went to bury his mother and to mourn for her when she passed away. When asked, he said that ""the devotion that one owes one’s mother should be expressed fittingly at all times, and certainly through her funeral and mourning rites""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00442,2022-04-05-T-017,442,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From the Ramayana, the Indians cherish Rama who was banished for 14 years to live in the forest by his mother Kaikeyi to make way for his half-brother, Baratha, to become the King. And he dutifully left the city in obedience to his mother."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00443,2022-04-05-T-017,443,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Malay/Muslims take lessons from Islam. When the Prophet was asked who a person should honour the most, or give the best treatment to, he replied, ""his mother"". And when asked again, ""then who?"", he said again, “his mother”, and again the third time, ""his mother"". Only at the fourth time did the Prophet say, ""his father""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00444,2022-04-05-T-017,444,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In honouring our mothers, it shows we are also taught to cherish and honour our wives, sisters and daughters. It is why we honour our Singapore women. As families, as a society and as a nation, we are stronger when our women, every woman, can flourish and realise their aspirations and their potential. Thus, we must be part of the solution."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00445,2022-04-05-T-017,445,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"And we will build upon this as a society – in workplaces, at home and in our community. At workplaces, our women contribute to a diversity of values, perspectives and capabilities. Having more women in leadership roles helps to catalyse robust governance and better stewardship of organisations. I am glad that women’s participation on Singapore boards is almost 20% in Top 100 listed companies and reaching 30% in Statutory Boards and Top 100 IPCs today."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00446,2022-04-05-T-017,446,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF will continue taking a multi-stakeholder approach that empowers stakeholders to collectively address underlying root causes. For instance, the Council for Board Diversity raises public awareness of the importance of women on boards and works with corporates to develop a pipeline of board-ready women. This would be more effective than setting mandatory quotas, which does not address root causes of the issue that have to do with culture and tradition."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00447,2022-04-05-T-017,447,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the years, we have also greatly increased support for our caregivers. In Singapore, strong families form the bedrock of our society. They are a key pillar of strength and our first line of support, providing unconditional love and support, through the ups and downs of life, such as that of our caregivers. Their role is irreplaceable but there will be those who need more support, beyond that from one another. We recognise their contributions to our families and society, and we will support them. Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam will elaborate, including the enhanced Home Caregiving Grant that would better help with caregiving costs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00448,2022-04-05-T-017,448,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Through the enhanced Silver Support Scheme and the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, we have also boosted the retirement incomes of Singaporeans, including caregivers, who may not have a chance to earn higher incomes during their working years."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00449,2022-04-05-T-017,449,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have also made major moves to make quality preschools more accessible and affordable to families to enable working parents, especially mothers, to pursue their career aspirations with peace of mind. By around 2025, eight in 10 Singaporean children can have a place in a Government-supported preschool. These are just some of the many Government-led initiatives to support caregivers and their families."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00450,2022-04-05-T-017,450,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But the Government cannot do this alone. The community has an important role to play, too. Caregivers can benefit from strong community support, especially fellow caregivers who share similar experiences and can offer practical and socio-emotional support. Allow me to share Richard's story, which is also featured in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00451,2022-04-05-T-017,451,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Richard left his job 22 years ago to care for his father who had cancer. Things became challenging when his father then developed dementia. His father would sometimes get violent with him and people around him. Fortunately, Richard received support from his neighbour and benefited from caregiver support programmes by the Caregivers Alliance Limited. Now, Richard gives back and volunteers with them to help other caregivers find strength and solve the issues that they are facing. Richard's story is significant."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00452,2022-04-05-T-017,452,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Firstly, I am encouraged that we are seeing more men like Richard playing a bigger role in caregiving. Like I said earlier, men must play their part in shaping societal norms towards a more equal partnership between men and women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00453,2022-04-05-T-017,453,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, Richard's story shows us the power of community support where caregivers benefit from one another's experiences and supporting one another through practical and socio-emotional support. Minister of State Low Yen Ling will speak more about this."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00454,2022-04-05-T-017,454,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would also like to add that even as our society progresses, there are still persons who experience violence. Let me state categorically that all forms of violence cannot and will not be condoned by our society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00455,2022-04-05-T-017,455,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Protecting women from violence and harm requires partnership across all spheres of society between men and women. Minister Shanmugam and Minister of State Sun Xueling will elaborate more on this.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00456,2022-04-05-T-017,456,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, it is timely and apt to consider a meaningful way to reflect the enduring importance of Singapore women's development in our society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00457,2022-04-05-T-017,457,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the closing session of the Conversations, the Prime Minister had announced that the Government had taken on board a proposal from the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO) and will dedicate a public garden to honour, celebrate and recognise the contributions of Singapore women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00458,2022-04-05-T-017,458,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I am pleased to announce that we have identified Dhoby Ghaut Green, which is located in the heart of the city, for the garden. The Government will work with community partners and the wider public to design and develop the garden. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00459,2022-04-05-T-017,459,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Prime Minister will also launch a travelling ""Celebrating Singapore Women"" exhibition on 22 April. The roving exhibition will celebrate our journey on women's development. It also aims to build awareness and ownership of the action plans amongst Singaporeans from various walks of life. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00460,2022-04-05-T-017,460,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In Singapore, we believe in equal partnership between men and women, with respect as its cornerstone. We honour and respect our women because it is the right and moral thing to do. This is an integral part of our cultural values, because we have been nurtured from young to honour, love and respect the most important woman of our lives – our mothers. Muslims draw lessons from our religion. Just as we honour our mothers, we are also taught to cherish and honour our wives, sisters and daughters."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00461,2022-04-05-T-017,461,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As men, we can and should step up to do more to support our Singapore women. For instance, we can play an active role in caregiving for our children and elderly. We should also support our women as they pursue their aspirations at the workplace and in society. As families, as a society and as a nation, we become stronger when our women are given the opportunity to flourish and realise their full potential."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00462,2022-04-05-T-017,462,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In English)  To conclude, the White Paper is just the start of a decade of work. There will be many more conversations and action plans to come. It is a decade-long plan of action and commitment by MSF, the Government and key partners, which we will carry to fruition."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00463,2022-04-05-T-017,463,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will build a culture of respect and partnership between men and women and across all spheres of society. This is what will take us forward in the next bound. I would like to extend our sincere invitation to all Members, including those from the Opposition, to come join us in our endeavour to advance Singapore women's development towards a fairer and more inclusive society. [Applause.]"

2022-04-05-T-017-S-00465,2022-04-05-T-017,465,Yeo Wan Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as I celebrated International Women's Day (IWD) last month with my sisters, constituents and unionists, I was greatly inspired by the women from all walks of life sharing what it meant to break the gender bias, smash glass ceilings and reach for the stars."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00466,2022-04-05-T-017,466,Yeo Wan Ling,"If we take a look around, we will realise that we are surrounded by so many inspirational Singaporean women. In one IWD panel, I met with four such inspirational women with very, very diverse life stories."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00467,2022-04-05-T-017,467,Yeo Wan Ling,"Chef Judy is a successful chef and, after a very painful divorce, she used the baking skills she learned from her very supportive ex-mother-in-law to become a successful cafe and baking school business owner."

2022-04-05-T-017-S-00471,2022-04-05-T-017,471,Yeo Wan Ling,"These stories and achievements of our ladies reflect the strength and determination we possess as we strive for excellence. This is, in part, made possible by the considerable improvements and opportunities, protection and safety nets that Singapore has developed over the years – evident in the increase in women graduates and women employment, along with the growth of women in leadership and board positions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00472,2022-04-05-T-017,472,Yeo Wan Ling,"However, in our efforts to honour our women who #breakthebias, our actions need to continually reflect the inherent challenges that women continue to face in our society, communities and families. With this, I welcome the 25 very far-reaching recommendations made in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00473,2022-04-05-T-017,473,Yeo Wan Ling,"If our laws and policies are to reflect the standards we, as a society, desire, then this House must continue to look to pursue choices that seek to achieve a fairer and more inclusive society where both men and women, as equal partners, are free to chase their aspirations to the fullest."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00474,2022-04-05-T-017,474,Yeo Wan Ling,"The NTUC recognises its pivotal position in spearheading efforts to achieve greater gender equality in Singapore and has, through the decades, been a progressive and relevant voice for our women, from the women's programme under Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon to the Women's Development Secretariat led by Mdm President Halimah Yacob to its current incarnation, the NTUC Women and Family Unit."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00475,2022-04-05-T-017,475,Yeo Wan Ling,"Indeed, the creation of a more inclusive society does not differentiate on gender and relies, first, on the ability to provide equal opportunities for women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00476,2022-04-05-T-017,476,Yeo Wan Ling,"Today, our women are flourishing in careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), IT, entrepreneurship, services, manufacturing and our choices are often limited only by our interests and passions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00477,2022-04-05-T-017,477,Yeo Wan Ling,"However, our work is far from being completed. Apart from developing favourable policies that elevate women in the workforce, the Labour Movement sees the pertinent need to widen the field for women by re-imagining and refreshing our career choices."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00478,2022-04-05-T-017,478,Yeo Wan Ling,"In addition to the promotion of STEM careers, the NTUC Women and Family Unit has identified even more opportunities and market gaps in critical but neglected professions that are traditionally dominated proudly by women, such as dressmakers and nannies. Together with the Labour Movement's ecosystem partners, we have started the process of refreshing and professionalising such occupations and have piloted place and train programmes in these sectors."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00479,2022-04-05-T-017,479,Yeo Wan Ling,"The Labour Movement recognises that our Singaporean women often play the role as the primary caregiver in our families and thus have been advocating since the 1990s on flexible work arrangements (FWAs) as a workplace norm. We welcome and support the White Paper's recommendations on FWAs. Beyond new tripartite guidelines on FWAs, we call on employers to take steps to ensure fairness in the appraisal and performance management of workers on FWAs. Workers must be clear about their duties, expectations and deadlines when they are on FWA."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00480,2022-04-05-T-017,480,Yeo Wan Ling,"Women go through many seasons and we recognise that women at different points of their lives would leave, enter or re-enter the workforce. Many face difficulty re-entering the workforce after an extended hiatus as there is a mismatch in expectations and support between employers and women returners."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00481,2022-04-05-T-017,481,Yeo Wan Ling,"The Labour Movement has sought to bridge this gap by providing training and mentoring that women can leverage to give themselves a leg up. The Labour Movement, through the NTUC Women and Family Unit's Women Supporting Women mentorship programme, grants women at all levels, including PMETs, access to women mentors who provide support and guidance, allowing our women to have a better landing when they are returning to the workplace or even to pursue better and shinier pathways at work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00482,2022-04-05-T-017,482,Yeo Wan Ling,I witnessed the journey of some 50 mentees who benefited from this programme and I would like to share the experience of one Ms K.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00483,2022-04-05-T-017,483,Yeo Wan Ling,"A single mom to three young children, Ms K quit her job five years ago as she was constantly taking childcare leave to take care of her young children. When she joined the programme, she was taken under the wing of unionist sister Daphne Ng from the Singapore FinTech Association. This six-month journey together culminated in sister Daphne recommending Ms K to a full-time role that provided flexible work arrangements (FWAs), which catered both to Ms K's caregiving and professional needs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00484,2022-04-05-T-017,484,Yeo Wan Ling,Such success stories have spurred the Labour Movement to bring the Women Supporting Women mentorship programme to more local communities. The Labour Movement welcomes the White Paper's recommendations on using mentorships to augment opportunities for women to re-enter the workplace.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00485,2022-04-05-T-017,485,Yeo Wan Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, while the NTUC has pioneered actions that look to create opportunities and provide support for women to enter and re-enter the workforce, we also recognise the need to enhance our measures to protect women from workforce harassment and discrimination."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00486,2022-04-05-T-017,486,Yeo Wan Ling,"Earlier this year, a survey conducted by the Women and Family Unit and the PAP Women's Wing revealed the worrying trends of gender discrimination that our women of today face at their workplaces. Not only did the report show that women perceive that they are disproportionately facing workplace discrimination, it also highlighted the prevalence of a lack of company know-how and policy against such workplace discrimination and harassment. This is, in particular, amongst companies that do not enjoy the abundance of resources and manpower."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00487,2022-04-05-T-017,487,Yeo Wan Ling,"The NTUC has, hence, started to look to channel efforts into enhancing the protection of SME workers by engaging our employers in dialogues, talks and webinars, whilst providing shared HR resources that work to prevent workplace discrimination and to protect whistle-blowers within reason. We are committed to equipping our SMEs and companies with better standard operating procedures (SOPs) that can help to create discrimination- and harassment-free workplaces."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00488,2022-04-05-T-017,488,Yeo Wan Ling,"NTUC has long championed actions to address discrimination in the workplace. We were party to drafting the tripartite guidelines on non-discriminatory job advertisements that were issued in 1999. We co-led the formation of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) in 2006 to promote fair and equitable employment practices as well as to provide an avenue for workers to report such unfair practices on them. TAFEP, subsequently, formulated the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in 2007, which has helped guide companies in adopting fair and merit-based employment practices."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00489,2022-04-05-T-017,489,Yeo Wan Ling,NTUC has also been advocating for measures to level the playing field between Singaporeans and foreign workers for opportunities since 2011. These were implemented in the form of the Fair Consideration Framework and the National Jobs Bank in 2014.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00490,2022-04-05-T-017,490,Yeo Wan Ling,"More recently, in 2021, the PME Task Force driven by NTUC and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) called for strengthening enforcement against errant companies adopting unfair practices, such as by empowering TAFEP to impose penalties on recalcitrant companies and putting in place safe whistle-blowing policies and procedures to combat discrimination in the workplace. We are heartened that these calls made by NTUC will be reflected in the move to enshrine the TGFEP in law."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00491,2022-04-05-T-017,491,Yeo Wan Ling,"As we look forward to proposals by the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness at the end of 2022, we will continue to safeguard the safety of women workers and help employers create a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00492,2022-04-05-T-017,492,Yeo Wan Ling,"From the time I have stepped into this House, I have seen the concerted effort of our nation and this House in supporting the development of women in Singapore. While we have made progress over the years, NTUC has identified multiple significant challenges that women continually face as they pursue their career aspirations. NTUC believes that one's gender should never be an obstacle or a hindrance in the workforce and we will make every effort to provide opportunities and resources that work towards championing our women and the workplace. Mr Speaker, I support the White Paper and the Motion. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00493,2022-04-05-T-017,493,Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00494,2022-04-05-T-017,494,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the recommendations made in the White Paper on Women's Development. Many Members of the House are speaking today on this very important topic and I will focus my speech on jobs. Specifically, the need to provide women with equal opportunities at the workplace, so that we can support their aspirations to have both a fulfilling family life and a rewarding career."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00495,2022-04-05-T-017,495,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Let me start by laying out the challenges faced by women at the workplace. Women face headwinds at every stage of their professional careers. Early on, while studying and choosing which career path to take, some hesitate to jump into male-dominated sectors, such as those in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) industries. Women also face challenges when they find out that they are expecting a child. Some tell me that they worry about being penalised in their appraisals when they go on maternity leave. Others shared with me that they had to suspend their job search because employers do not seem to want to hire someone who will need to take months off soon after being employed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00496,2022-04-05-T-017,496,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"For mothers who chose to leave the corporate world temporarily to care for their children and are looking to return to work, it can be daunting to return to a workplace that has changed significantly in the time that they were away. Many women also struggle to find opportunities to earn additional income while being a full-time homemaker or primary caregiver to their children and their elderly parents."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00497,2022-04-05-T-017,497,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"For our young millennials, they have a vastly different outlook on what work-life harmony is, as they are more educated and have higher levels of career confidence. Many of them are rightfully ambitious and want to shine on the global stage, but do we have the right structures in place to support their aspirations?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00498,2022-04-05-T-017,498,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"To address these challenges, I will focus my suggestions on three areas  jobs at home, jobs closer to home and jobs away from home."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00499,2022-04-05-T-017,499,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"First, let us provide better support to women, especially those with caregiving responsibilities, who wish to continue working from home. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that it is possible for some categories of workers to telecommute full-time. I am, therefore, heartened that the Government has committed to entrenching FWAs as a workplace norm and to introduce new Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024 to ensure that employers consider FWA requests fairly and properly."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00500,2022-04-05-T-017,500,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"But we can, and should, accelerate the implementation timeline. While I understand that it takes time to engage the industry and ensure that there is consensus on the Tripartite Guidelines, we should strike when the iron is hot – in Chinese, we call this 打铁趁热 – and roll out the guidelines when many employers are still fresh from having the majority of their workforce telecommuting."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00501,2022-04-05-T-017,501,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"We should also support the aspirations of enterprising women who start home-based businesses to supplement their household income, while being a full-time caregiver or homemaker. During my house visits, I have met many enterprising ""mumpreneurs"" in Radin Mas who have started their festive cookie businesses, bakers who specialise in customised cake designs, and one woman who even started her own trading company right from the comfort of her own living room!"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00502,2022-04-05-T-017,502,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"I hope that the Government, trade associations and self-help groups can provide better support to help aspiring home-based entrepreneurs kickstart and grow their businesses. One good example of a self-help group is Project Cookoh, a community effort that helps housewives in Jalan Kukoh start their own home-based business. Project Cookoh mentors mumpreneurs, subsidises the cost of cooking classes and provides an online platform to help the women market their products. We plan to start a similar programme in Radin Mas later this year."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00503,2022-04-05-T-017,503,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"To help more aspiring mumpreneurs, I hope the Government can introduce a Home-based Business Grant to help defray the start-up cost of equipment and tie up with schools, such as SHATEC, to provide subsidised training courses for baking, cooking and safe food preparation, for example."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00504,2022-04-05-T-017,504,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Second, I believe we can do more to help women find jobs that are closer to home, so that they can better balance their work and role as a caregiver. In Radin Mas, we partnered the Singapore Manufacturing Federation to launch the Jobs Closer to Home programme in 2021, to help women with caregiving responsibilities find jobs that are within five kilometres of the constituency, or a few bus stops away from home. This has been particularly helpful for single mothers, as they often hesitate to take on jobs in locations that require long travel time. I hope that the Government, through our Community Development Councils and working with the NTUC, can scale the Jobs Closer to Home programme nationally and help employers tap into a ready pool of women who wish to work for companies that are based near their homes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00505,2022-04-05-T-017,505,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Third, let us better support the aspirations of our millennial women. According to a survey conducted by PWC, 71% of millennial women aspire to take on a global role. However, Mercer's 2020 Worldwide Survey on International Assignment Policies and Practices found that only 20% of the global expatriate workforce is made up of women. This disconnect between aspiration and reality is concerning. In many companies, going on international assignments and having extensive global experience is a precondition to reach senior management levels. A persistently low participation rate of women in international assignments will, ultimately, affect gender equality at the leadership level."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00506,2022-04-05-T-017,506,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Good mentorship is, therefore, vital to provide women with the assurance to venture overseas for their postings. One good example can be found in the Financial Women's Association (FWA). FWA has a deep pool of successful women in the financial industry who contribute their time by mentoring younger women in the sector. Many of FWA's mentors have gone through overseas stints and their mentees are able to approach them for advice on how to overcome challenges and flourish from such opportunities. I hope that with EDB's support, more professional associations and industry partners will create such mentorship programmes to help our millennial women professionals go global."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00507,2022-04-05-T-017,507,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Finally, regardless of whether they are working at home, close to home, or far away from home, we need to tackle the discrimination faced by pregnant women professionals. MOM is in the process of enshrining the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) into legislation and I hope that the Act will state unequivocally that employers cannot penalise female employees or reject a perfectly qualified jobseeker simply based on pregnancy."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00508,2022-04-05-T-017,508,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the White Paper on Women's Development marks an important milestone in Singapore's never-ending journey towards ensuring an equal and inclusive society. As a community, we can do more to support the aspirations of our Singaporean women to have both a fulfilling family life and a rewarding career. Sir, I support the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00509,2022-04-05-T-017,509,Speaker,Ms Poh Li San.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00510,2022-04-05-T-017,510,Poh Li San,"Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a city where human resource is scarce and the supply of talent and skills is not commensurate with our required demand. With our ageing workforce and inability to recruit and retain competent resources, the risk of an unsustainable economy and a rise in inequality may increase. So, are we doing enough in this competitive and fast-evolving global economy? Are our institutional mindsets adjusted to attract more Singapore women to have a more significant role in our workforce?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00511,2022-04-05-T-017,511,Poh Li San,"We have made some progress in the development of women since the passing of the Women's Charter some 50 years ago. We can do much more. The role of today's women is no longer just about gender equality, preconceptions or biases but diversity, inclusion and the social development of communities and families. The White Paper on Women's Development is timely, with its recommendations in empowering women to play a bigger role in more economic sectors and to helm leadership positions across various industries."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00512,2022-04-05-T-017,512,Poh Li San,"Over the past decades, several organisations have successfully tapped talents from the female workforce. They have provided women with opportunities to excel in the workforce and such opportunities provided the path to senior roles. More opportunities must be provided to women in predominantly male organisations and companies."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00513,2022-04-05-T-017,513,Poh Li San,"I am passionate about the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and one area that our women can contribute to would be our defence sector. Recent conflicts around the world have reminded us starkly that we cannot depend on anyone else to protect ourselves, our nation. In reference to a Straits Times article published in February 2016, in the next 50 years, the number of male Singaporeans between 15 and 24 years old is expected to halve. The numbers are pretty alarming. The percentage of the total women service personnel in the SAF is only about 7%. Should we be seriously considering more Singaporean women to be part of SAF?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00514,2022-04-05-T-017,514,Poh Li San,"When I joined SAF as a helicopter pilot in the Air Force some 25 years ago, there were only five women pilots in the entire Air Force and we were limited to flying transport planes and helicopters. Since then, the rules have changed. There are, currently, more women pilots and they are flying mean machines like the F15SG Eagles and F-16 Falcons. Some of these women pilots are even helming the fort as Squadron Commanders."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00515,2022-04-05-T-017,515,Poh Li San,"Similarly, there are breakthroughs made in various combat units in the Army and the Navy. SAF's efforts to continue to attract and retain women and placing them in frontline combat roles are very encouraging. However, we will have to do more in attracting women to be part of our defence team. It has been more than 35 years since the very first combat servicewoman was recruited and I am looking forward to the Minister for Defence's assessment of the progress in this regard, specifically on the measures to increase the proportion of servicewomen and progression pathways for our women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00516,2022-04-05-T-017,516,Poh Li San,"Women have made some progress over the years in the Singapore Police Force. From just 10 Policewomen in 1949 to 19%, of which 16% are in senior leadership roles. This is a 50% increase from 2011. Women Police officers can play a key role in enhancing the security and safety of our society, especially when the nature of crimes has evolved and technology has enhanced our ability to conduct surveillance and crime prevention. Let us try to bring up the percentages of women Police officers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00517,2022-04-05-T-017,517,Poh Li San,"If physically and mentally demanding roles in the SAF and SPF have made progress in the representation of women over the years, employers, such as the Civil Service, Statutory Boards and MNCs should also set an example by recruiting more women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00518,2022-04-05-T-017,518,Poh Li San,"In fact, some Nordic countries had implemented gender quotas in their parliaments and in the board room. These practices can assist in expediting the progress of women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00519,2022-04-05-T-017,519,Poh Li San,"Where there is a shortage of talent and keen competition to recruit and retain capable staff in the sunrise and fast-growing sectors, such as sustainability and IT, companies should look beyond their usual hunting grounds and tap half the manpower talent pool in the female population as a solution to their problems. You may like to know that in the early days of the United States' space programme, all the ""human computers"" were women. These are the staff at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) who performed highly complex mathematical calculations for aviation experiments and, subsequently, spaceflights. So, have no misconception that women do not have the IT aptitude."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00520,2022-04-05-T-017,520,Poh Li San,"I am in agreement with the White Paper's recommendation to encourage and support women to choose and excel in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) industries, which have been predominantly male, until recent years."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00521,2022-04-05-T-017,521,Poh Li San,"I am currently employed in the aviation sector and women make up only 3% of chief executives, compared with more than 10% in many other industries. We can do better."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00522,2022-04-05-T-017,522,Poh Li San,"Women's low representation in STEM careers has been described as a ""leaky pipeline"". In our Primary and Secondary schools, girls often perform as well as the boys in science and mathematics. But as they progress to the tertiary level, fewer opt for STEM subjects, especially when it comes to engineering and computer science. Only 55% of the women who graduated with STEM degrees or diplomas pursued related careers, compared to 70% of men. We need to look into this. A women's contribution can only further assist in the field of engineering and science."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00523,2022-04-05-T-017,523,Poh Li San,"I also agree with the recommendations made in the White Paper to enhance equality in the workplace. It is important to make a concerted effort to encourage our young women to chase their dreams and develop their fullest potential in their careers without any hesitation and with the fullest support. As the Paper has pointed out, mindsets about what jobs are appropriate for which gender will need to shift."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00524,2022-04-05-T-017,524,Poh Li San,"It is crucial to showcase the wide and diverse range of possibilities and opportunities for women. Over the years, many trailblazing women have paved the way for our younger women and provided them the much-needed inspiration and confidence to achieve their goals that will, in turn, help Singapore to progress."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00525,2022-04-05-T-017,525,Poh Li San,"Mr Speaker, I would like to say a few words in Malay."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00526,2022-04-05-T-017,526,Poh Li San,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Earlier in my speech, I mentioned the progress made by the Singapore Police Force in women’s development over the past decades."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00527,2022-04-05-T-017,527,Poh Li San,"One pioneering female officer in the Police force is Mdm Zuraidah Abdullah. She joined the SPF in 1986, helmed several command positions in operations and training and was the first woman to achieve the rank of Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00528,2022-04-05-T-017,528,Poh Li San,"Beyond the Police Force, Mdm Zuraidah was also the chairperson of the Malay Heritage Foundation and currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of self-help group MENDAKI after her retirement from the SPF. Mdm Zuraidah was also inducted into the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame in 2014 to honour her achievements."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00529,2022-04-05-T-017,529,Poh Li San,I am heartened that outstanding women have been given accolades like Mdm Zuraidah. The stories of these outstanding women have inspired younger women to challenge themselves and excel beyond their predecessors.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00530,2022-04-05-T-017,530,Poh Li San,"(In English)  Over the years, we have seen more women athletes excelling in sports. At the recent Tokyo Olympics, out of our 23 national athletes fielded, 17 were women. Similarly, of the 10 competitors for the Paralympics, there were six female representatives. I am hopeful that more women national athletes will make Singaporeans proud."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00531,2022-04-05-T-017,531,Poh Li San,"The media and entertainment industry has an impact and plays a vital role in the amplification of women in society. Often times, women are portrayed second to men and that stereotyping is blindly amplifying certain biases."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00532,2022-04-05-T-017,532,Poh Li San,"Not all women are Bond girls whose sole responsibility is to wait for their handsome male hero to come home to them or behave like the female protagonist in constant distress, as portrayed in Korean drama ""Crash Landing on You""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00533,2022-04-05-T-017,533,Poh Li San,I certainly hope the next Bond star will be a female lead and more female being portrayed as heroines in dramas. We need to reshape the archaic perceptions of how women are portrayed in our society. Our local media must work towards shifting the narrative by placing equal emphasis between men and women by sharing aspirational stories with a positive reflection of fairness and inclusivity for all genders and races and not just for the rich or powerful. We must curate positive stories that will inspire and amplify the right values.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00534,2022-04-05-T-017,534,Poh Li San,"Other than the media, public events and fora featuring female speakers, discussing issues that are of concern to the women community are important informal ways for women to share their experience and learn from one another. In Sembawang West, women corporate and community leaders attend our annual SG Women's Festival event to share their experience and discuss best practices in areas, such as career, financial planning, health and wellness, caregiving and sustainability. These platforms help to create informal interest groups and build a support ecosystem for women. To add, the SG Heroines Award, CNA Women Award and Her World Women of the Year Award are important recognitions that inspire and rally women communities to do more for the society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00535,2022-04-05-T-017,535,Poh Li San,"I support the White Paper's proposal to develop career mentorship and networking opportunities for women. We need more professional and informal women bodies to recruit, retain and network with women in the various sectors. For instance, the Women Aviation International SG chapter was set up in March 2021 to encourage more young women to join the aviation sector. While it is an initiative started by women for the benefit of other women, there is sincere support from our male counterparts who understand the need to attract and retain the best talents into this industry. Being a participant in their programmes, I am heartened by the support from agencies and companies, such as the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Association of Aerospace Industries (Singapore) and Airbus Singapore, for example."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00536,2022-04-05-T-017,536,Poh Li San,"Mr Speaker, I would like to speak in Mandarin for the next segment."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00537,2022-04-05-T-017,537,Poh Li San,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Since both men and women contribute in the workforce, it is necessary for the Government to provide better facilities for homecare. I fully support the call in the White Paper for more equality in the family and society, because caregivers themselves also need to rest and be cared for."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00538,2022-04-05-T-017,538,Poh Li San,I am glad to note that access to affordable and quality preschool facilities will be enhanced. I urge the Ministry to pay special attention to estates with many young families and provide adequate childcare facilities.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00539,2022-04-05-T-017,539,Poh Li San,"Likewise, in ageing estates, the Ministry must ensure senior day-care centres are easily accessible and affordable. With a rapidly-ageing population, we can expect more demand for migrant domestic workers to assist with caregiving for seniors. As of 2020, there are almost 250,000 migrant domestic workers in Singapore. This is not sustainable for the nation in the long run."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00540,2022-04-05-T-017,540,Poh Li San,We will need to provide more and better institutional care and community support for seniors so that their children can go to work with peace of mind. People should also be better informed about geriatric care and the community support system available.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00541,2022-04-05-T-017,541,Poh Li San,"(In English)  Working women tend to juggle one too many roles at home and at work. Prolonged periods of heavy loads can be draining on their own physical and mental health and may even cause burnouts. At a certain phase, they may have to prioritise familial responsibilities, like caregiving for young children or aged parents and take a break from their jobs. I trust that the Government will consider providing incentives to encourage MNCs, and especially SMEs, to introduce a sabbatical system not just for women but for both genders. Women, actually, do care about the men's welfare as well."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00542,2022-04-05-T-017,542,Poh Li San,"Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Minister of State Sun Xueling, Minister of State Low Yen Ling, Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mazam, members of the PAP Women's Wing and Young PAP, as well as to many others who had contributed towards the White Paper on Singapore Women's Development. I am confident that the recommendations will drive significant improvements in the decades ahead and enable more women in Singapore to hold up half the sky, while the men hold up the other half."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00543,2022-04-05-T-017,543,Poh Li San,"On a personal note, as we chart our new way forward together, I hope to see more women representation in the Cabinet with more than just a mere 15% made up of only three women and 17 male Ministers. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude my support for the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00544,2022-04-05-T-017,544,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00545,2022-04-05-T-017,545,He Ting Ru,"Mr Speaker, when moving the Motion on Empowering Women last year, I spoke about how we stand on the shoulders of those who forged the way before us and how we must continue to build on the progress that women have made to get us to where we are today. I spoke about society and the economy at large and how they benefit from greater equality for women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00546,2022-04-05-T-017,546,He Ting Ru,"Finally, I talked about the personal  how just two generations prior, my grandmother had to fight hard just to be allowed to go back to school for a meagre two more years before she was once again shut up at home and asked to wait to be married off. I also shared my hopes that my sons would grow up in a fairer society and do their part to ensure that women and girls are not only given equal opportunities to forge their chosen paths in life, but that they will also be respected as equals and see outcomes that are on par with those for boys and men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00547,2022-04-05-T-017,547,He Ting Ru,All these remain relevant today with the release last week of the White Paper on Singapore Women's Development. The Conversations on Singapore Women's Development were launched in September 2020 with sessions taking place through the year that followed. Twenty-twenty-one was also designated the year of celebrating SG women with its attendant events and activities.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00548,2022-04-05-T-017,548,He Ting Ru,"Yet, despite being over a year in the making, the White Paper was released barely a week ago, leaving Singaporeans with precious little time to go through the White Paper and consider its recommendations before the issues contained within are debated here in Parliament. There was just not enough time for my residents to provide feedback on the over 100 pages of its contents."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00549,2022-04-05-T-017,549,He Ting Ru,Contrast this with the no less consequential population White Paper which was released on 9 January 2013. That 41-page long paper was debated and passed in Parliament a month later on 9 February.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00550,2022-04-05-T-017,550,He Ting Ru,"The seeming haste raises questions about whether the rushed timeline is necessary, or even beneficial to public debate and understanding. An invitation for full and rigorous public scrutiny is one of the key tools for managing and countering misinformation and disinformation, and goes a long way towards dispelling unwarranted and unwelcomed conspiracies."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00551,2022-04-05-T-017,551,He Ting Ru,"That said, I am happy to see the paper acknowledging that a whole-of-nation approach has to be taken. The Workers' Party supports the spirit of the Motion and the White Paper's overarching goal of achieving a fairer and more inclusive society. However, we believe improvements can be made. My colleagues and I will address some of these during the course of today's debate."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00552,2022-04-05-T-017,552,He Ting Ru,"To start, the White Paper specifically targets Singapore women. I feel we can do better  the principles and aspirations contained within the paper should form a blueprint of what we, as a society, stand for and what we value, no matter who you are. Additionally, the protections and aims should apply to all women in Singapore, regardless of nationality or status. My colleague Mr Leon Perera will elaborate further on these issues."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00553,2022-04-05-T-017,553,He Ting Ru,"Moving on to the gender wage gap. The latest publicly available study conducted in 2018 and published in 2020 by MOM showed that there was still an adjusted wage gap of 6%. The White Paper mentions that the adjusted rate has dropped further to 4.3% in 2020, with the unadjusted median gender pay gap being 14.4%. While this pay gap is on the decline, it, nonetheless, still exists and I hope we will go beyond the points suggested in this White Paper to close the gap. Our efforts at reducing this pay gap must persist until women in Singapore achieve equal pay to their male counterparts for equal work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00554,2022-04-05-T-017,554,He Ting Ru,"We also need to ask about what the adverse effect the pandemic and our recovery from it has had on the gender wage gap and the effect of the chronic under-valuing and under-paying of jobs that are traditionally the preserve of women. These include nursing, caring, and teaching. Millions of us in lockdown around the globe found out first-hand how critical these workers are for the functioning and well-being of our economies, societies and families."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00555,2022-04-05-T-017,555,He Ting Ru,"The real gender wage gap also should take into account the number of women who do not ""lean in"" to seek higher paying jobs, promotions or careers, due to reasons, such as a lack of confidence, familiarity or just plain discomfort with what is seen as ""too male"" environments. My colleague, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, will speak more on this."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00556,2022-04-05-T-017,556,He Ting Ru,"Additionally, the 2020 MOM study asks but does not answer why such segregation exists. It mentions data from two years with a 16-year gap – 2002 and 2018. This does not give us a good picture of the problem. We, therefore, repeat the call from our manifesto that employers with 10 or more employees should be required to report to MOM the gender pay gap for the same job description. This information must be made publicly available, in aggregate form. Only with such publicly available basic data on a regular basis, could we have a better idea of the problem and move to close the gender wage gap. This will help employers increase access to a wider talent pool, enhance the diversity of their workforce and better attract and retain capable workers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00557,2022-04-05-T-017,557,He Ting Ru,"Unfortunately, the adverse impact on women's purchasing power does not stop at the gender pay gap. There has been more attention in recent years given to the study of the phenomenon of what is known as the ""pink tax"", loosely defined as producers and providers charging more for the same products and services once these are marketed at women. A study commissioned in 2015 by New York City found that women's products cost 7% more than similar products for men and that women paid more in every industry studied. Back home, a study by the Sunday Times of 10 retailers found women paying more for half of them. It appears that such gender-based pricing penalises women for, well, being women!"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00558,2022-04-05-T-017,558,He Ting Ru,"The scope of this phenomenon and whether it is actually justified warrants a study in Singapore. Women also bear a disproportionate share of unpaid labour, both tangible and ""invisible"" in the form of the mental load, because it is still usually the woman who is expected to oversee the smooth running of our households. The burden is also on her shoulders to ensure that the children are watered and fed, and that she not only has to coordinate the schedule, but is also expected to take time off work to attend to medical and other appointments of their dependants. The Member for Aljunied, Mr Gerald Giam, will speak more about what we can do to ensure that our unpaid caregivers – both women and men – are recognised and supported."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00559,2022-04-05-T-017,559,He Ting Ru,"It is no wonder that there are also increasing recognition and data showing that women are disproportionately affected globally by rising costs of living – because they start from a weaker economic position that is exacerbated by all the factors mentioned above. We have, in this House, spoken at length about climate change and its effect on Singapore, yet I note that in an article earlier this year, UN Women wrote, ""the climate crisis is not 'gender neutral'. Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health and safety."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00560,2022-04-05-T-017,560,He Ting Ru,"Such climate-driven inequalities do not affect only developing nations, but also high-income ones, such as Singapore. I also cannot help but notice that most of the jobs in the traditional energy sectors are almost entirely male-dominated. The green transition, therefore, represents a chance for us to ensure that women are well and justly represented in these new ""green jobs"" and we must work to ensure that the gender gap in STEM skills does not prove to be a barrier to greater gender equality in a low-carbon future."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00561,2022-04-05-T-017,561,He Ting Ru,"The White Paper, too, would like us to challenge these stereotypes, to push women to take leadership roles and to support entrepreneurship. Indeed, removing barriers to female entrepreneurship will not only drive national economic growth, but also contribute to empowering women to be financially self-sufficient. The establishment of the Singapore Women Entrepreneurs Network by SBF last September is a welcome step to create a community of support for existing female entrepreneurs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00562,2022-04-05-T-017,562,He Ting Ru,"Would this initiative be expanded to support budding, prospective female entrepreneurs, with an emphasis on women in traditionally male-dominated industries, such as energy and STEM? Would there also be any special emphasis on Femtech? What about women who own micro businesses with different concerns?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00563,2022-04-05-T-017,563,He Ting Ru,"And while I am on this topic, and since we are discussing mindset shifts today, perhaps it is also time to do away with gendered terms like ""girl boss"" and ""mumtrepreneurs"", which, to me, seem to suggest that there is something out of the ordinary about women or mothers taking a lead in business."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00564,2022-04-05-T-017,564,He Ting Ru,"When it comes to representation at the top, having more women in decision-making leadership roles has many benefits and gives young women role models to look up to."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00565,2022-04-05-T-017,565,He Ting Ru,"A resident also pointed out to me that the multi-Ministerial task force to fight COVID-19 was an all-male affair when it came to the co-chairs and other public-facing figures – which, surely, causes some dissonance, given that the paper itself acknowledges that women are disproportionately more affected by the pandemic. While it is undoubtedly true that we cannot make progress without ""allies"", I hope we do better at giving women a public leadership voice when we ""build back better"" coming out of COVID-19's long, long shadow. My colleague Sylvia Lim spoke about this extensively last year and I would like to repeat her call for change to make it conducive for women to step up to the political forefront."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00566,2022-04-05-T-017,566,He Ting Ru,"Turning to anti-discrimination legislation, I am happy to hear that anti-discrimination legislation will be introduced in Singapore. This move has long been called for by Members in this House and, indeed, is one of the proposals contained in our 2020 manifesto, where we called for anti-discrimination legislation to be formally instituted to prohibit against employment discrimination on the basis of race, gender, age and against Singapore Citizens. After all, legislating against discrimination would make such practices illegal and, presumably, will come with attendant penalties for non-compliance. It would also give our businesses clarity to know what discriminatory practices are, and to introduce internal processes to protect their employees from discrimination."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00567,2022-04-05-T-017,567,He Ting Ru,"It is also notable that discrimination and discriminatory practices persist despite the guidance and counselling offered through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). It is why we are still even talking about the issue today, and the White Paper includes tackling discrimination as one of its topics."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00568,2022-04-05-T-017,568,He Ting Ru,"The guidance approach is just not good enough. We need legislation and policies that actually work. While mediation is an option, there needs to be proper mechanisms for monitoring, investigation, adjudication and deterrence in place. I hope that we will take reference from other jurisdictions to see how thoughtful legislation outlawing such discriminatory behaviour can benefit women and other vulnerable groups."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00569,2022-04-05-T-017,569,He Ting Ru,"I would now like to turn to a major role that many women play  becoming a mother. When I was pregnant with my youngest, his eldest brother, who was only aged four at the time, came up to me at bedtime and told me, ""Mama, I am glad I am not a woman."" When I asked him why, he told me very seriously that it was because ""it’s so hard to be pregnant"". And, indeed, while parenthood brings much joy and growth, I do distinctly recall how lost and bewildered I felt the day we brought him home from the hospital. Having gone through 26 hours of labour and finally giving birth to an almost four-kilogramme baby, I was exhausted, in a huge amount of pain and just felt as if I had been run over by a bus, multiple times."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00570,2022-04-05-T-017,570,He Ting Ru,"Baby’s constant wails and demands for food also left me frantically trying to find answers from my phone – with my husband being equally panicked. My mother, from a generation who were told that ""formula was more nutritious"", was also unable to help with the challenging task of breastfeeding. Despite this rocky start, I was extremely fortunate. For a village quickly grew up around me  aside from my parents assiduously ensuring that I had all the food and nutrients needed to recover in the immediate postpartum period, cousins and friends, who were themselves young parents, also offered all kinds of assistance. These ranged from offers for respite care in various shapes or forms, helpful recommendations and also late-night conversations on WhatsApp as we, together, stayed awake nursing or rocking fussy babies into the wee hours of the morning."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00571,2022-04-05-T-017,571,He Ting Ru,One such conversation which shall always remain with me is a comment made by a cousin that she found being a mother was actually harder than summiting Mount Everest! This difficulty is why the development of a child and maternal health and well-being strategy is so important if we are to support women in their motherhood journey. Our focus must move beyond just medical care. It is good to see that efforts announced during the Committee of Supply (COS) this year will provide care for maternal mental health and to encourage support for them at the workplace and in the community.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00572,2022-04-05-T-017,572,He Ting Ru,"For new mums who do not have a village growing up around them, it is vital that they are given the right care and support in the vulnerable weeks and months that follow childbirth. They should also have easy access to non-judgemental advice and education about dealing with common issues ranging from lactation support, baby sleep advice and the change in relationship with their partners and families with a new baby."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00573,2022-04-05-T-017,573,He Ting Ru,"I hope that a task force will look at instituting practices, such as having specially-trained health visitors to routinely call on new moms just before delivery and during confinement, to answer questions and provide reassurance at home in a more relaxed, non-clinical environment as part of the norm. We also should learn from traditional practices like doing confinement and jamu, and retain those practices which promote postpartum recovery and well-being, as these contain, after all, the wisdom of generations of mothers who came before us."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00574,2022-04-05-T-017,574,He Ting Ru,"Beyond the early days and months, issues, such as mom guilt – where moms feel guilty for having to leave their children with a career while pursuing a career – and bearing a disproportionately larger share of the mental load, must also be addressed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00575,2022-04-05-T-017,575,He Ting Ru,"The task force must also consider how to support new fathers. It is not uncommon to hear that fathers often feel at a loss on how to support their wives and that they can feel alienated during the pregnancy and postpartum journey, all the while wondering how to bond with their newborns. This can have an adverse impact on them playing a greater role in bringing up their babies."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00576,2022-04-05-T-017,576,He Ting Ru,"More attention must also be paid to closing any gender health gaps that may exist. International studies show that in many areas of healthcare, women experience poorer outcomes. The UK's House of Lords had a debate last year on improving women's health outcomes and whether there is a gender health gap. Some societies have seen situations where women have longer life expectancies, but spend a longer period of time in ill health. These studies show, too, that women and ethnic minorities tend to experience bias when being treated for pain, and note that, generally speaking, healthcare systems and research have been built around men, leaving women chronically misunderstood, mistreated and misdiagnosed. There is also concern that, historically, women are left out of medical research, which is concerning, as recent research is shining a spotlight on how there is a gender impact on health and illness and that males and females respond differently to treatment."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00577,2022-04-05-T-017,577,He Ting Ru,"In Singapore, I note that a panel led by Senior Minister of State Amy Khor to advise HPB on women's health was set up in 2012 and that work has been done to promote women's health. It is heartening that there is targeted support for women's health outcomes and progress has, definitely, been made, but I believe we have not enough information publicly about how the concerns I raised above are being addressed in the Singapore context."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00578,2022-04-05-T-017,578,He Ting Ru,"We must go beyond just promoting women's health but also need to play our part to address any biases and ensuring that the research gap, when it comes to medical and health issues that affect women, is addressed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00579,2022-04-05-T-017,579,He Ting Ru,"Mr Speaker, I have covered a wide variety of topics and my colleagues will continue to speak on the other areas that need strengthening and improvement. Before I close, I would like to make one final point about the deep mindset shifts required of us and the comprehensive societal education necessary to bring about much-needed change. We have to go beyond the planned Character Citizenship Education (CCE) changes to ensure that our curriculum and education, in general, make a conscious effort to challenge gender stereotypes. For example, we should not see house and care work being the preserve of women and must be mindful of ensuring equal male and female role models are well represented."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00580,2022-04-05-T-017,580,He Ting Ru,"The rest of us must also do our part and be aware that our words and deeds matter. What we say and do are a reflection of our beliefs. It is, as my grandmother used to say  ""sim hor; sia hor; da hor"". In Hokkien, ""have a good heart, think good things, say good things."" I support the Motion. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00581,2022-04-05-T-017,581,Speaker,Ms Jessica Tan.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00582,2022-04-05-T-017,582,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the shared vision to take collective action and a whole-of-society approach towards making our society in Singapore a fairer and more inclusive one, where men and women partner as equals and can pursue our aspirations freely and to the fullest. We need to acknowledge the progress that Singapore women have made and the journey continues."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00583,2022-04-05-T-017,583,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The White Paper covers five important areas affecting women's aspirations and development, with concrete recommendations for action. I would not be able to do justice to the work that has been done in all the areas covered in the White Paper. So, I would like to focus my speech today on the areas of providing equal opportunities for women at the workplace."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00584,2022-04-05-T-017,584,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"There are four points that I would like to touch on  one, why it is imperative for businesses to attract and retain women in the growth sectors; two, the approach to Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs); three, the utilisation of parental and paternity leave; and four, mindset changes required."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00585,2022-04-05-T-017,585,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"I welcome the new workplace fairness legislation to provide a safe environment for women and those facing discrimination or harassment at the workplace to speak up without fear. Having role models to inspire women and greater participation of women in leadership and board positions are important. Beyond these actions, I would like to bring attention to the need to attract, develop and retain more women in the growth sectors. Why is this important? Growth sectors offer better job prospects, growth and remuneration. If not as many women are participating in growth sectors, then, eventually, it will lead to a gap in the progress and development between women and men in the workplace."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00586,2022-04-05-T-017,586,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"In Singapore, while the number of women in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector has increased to 32.4% in 2020, it is lower in comparison to other sectors. As companies push forward with their efforts to transform their businesses and with the growing importance of technology in business, STEM roles will be in demand. More can be done to understand why women in STEM roles are lower than in other sectors, so that the appropriate actions can be taken in partnership with businesses to attract and retain more women to STEM roles. I am not just saying that the companies need to hire more women, we need to make sure that women want to be in these roles; and we need to understand why they are not – it is increasing, but it is not there yet."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00587,2022-04-05-T-017,587,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Giving equal opportunities to women also has direct benefits for employers. The labour market is tight and businesses are facing challenges in getting the talent they need. Data released last week by MOM reported an increase in the number of job vacancies in Singapore. Job vacancies left unfilled for more than six months increased by 8%, to 35%. A significant proportion of these vacancies are PMET jobs in growth sectors of information and communications, financial and insurance services, professional services, health and social services."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00588,2022-04-05-T-017,588,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Women in Singapore are literate and educated. Since 1980, women make up 50% of the proportion of University graduates. In 2019, the number of women taking science, technology, engineering and mathematics in our local Universities was 41%. It just makes good business sense for companies to hire women in STEM roles. If they are not, they are missing out on tapping on half of the talent pool."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00589,2022-04-05-T-017,589,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Let me touch on the approach to FWAs. Recognising that women still tend to have the greater responsibility for caregiving, the White Paper has called for companies to provide FWAs to support more women to enter the workforce and progress. Work practices must be supportive of employees' needs but we should recognise that business and operational considerations cannot be ignored. In order to provide good jobs, businesses must be able to operate effectively. I do agree with the balanced approach that the White Paper is taking in advocating for employers to consider FWA requests fairly and properly while recognising that FWAs are not an entitlement."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00590,2022-04-05-T-017,590,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The White Paper outlines that MOM will work with the tripartite partners to put in place a new set of Tripartite Guidelines by 2024, requiring employers to fairly and properly consider FWA requests. My question is  why wait till 2024 to introduce the new set of Tripartite Guidelines? That would mean that it would be a year and a half before this happens. While I appreciate that time is needed to allow for consultation and to work on the new guidelines, if we believe that FWAs will enable fuller participation of women in the workforce, could we not start earlier and learn and refine from these experiences?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00591,2022-04-05-T-017,591,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Apart from the pace of the introduction of the Tripartite Guidelines for FWAs, I do want to highlight a few points on the approach to FWAs. For clarity, let me just refer to what we mean by FWAs. Taking what has been outlined in the Tripartite Standards for FWAs, it is defined as variations from usual work arrangements to include  one, flexi-load, for example, part-time or job-sharing; two, flexi-time, which is staggered hours and compressed work weeks; or three, flexi-place, for example, telecommuting."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00592,2022-04-05-T-017,592,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"If any good had come out of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is that it showed that businesses and employees could pivot to variations of FWAs. While there were initial challenges, there were real benefits of adopting FWAs for both businesses and workers. With FWAs, despite the restrictions, operations were able to continue, work could be done and jobs were retained. Beyond COVID-19, employers can also benefit directly from implementing FWAs to achieve productivity; to gain access to a larger talent pool, and I am not talking about just women but men, too; and to have business agility."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00593,2022-04-05-T-017,593,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"While not all work can adopt FWAs, do not get me wrong, I am not saying that everything has to have arrangements made for FWAs – and some cannot. But as we look to strengthening the guidelines for FWAs, I think more can be done to encourage businesses to review and incorporate FWAs as part of business norms as there are real business benefits. The approach and mindset of how we implement FWAs will also set the tone and the culture in the workplace. I believe that for FWAs to be effective, it cannot be just about requiring employers to give fair evaluation and consideration to employees' requests for FWAs when they require it. This approach, while seen as supportive of employees' needs for balancing their work-life responsibilities, does indirectly send a signal that FWAs are not the work norm or culture, and, hence, hesitation of both employers and employees to adopt FWAs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00594,2022-04-05-T-017,594,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"SMEs can also benefit from FWAs and, actually, they stand to benefit more. But, as we advocate for FWAs, we must recognise that, for SMEs, they will require more support than larger organisations in the implementation of FWAs, as they have very lean HR teams and they may not have the capacity and there will be a lot of transition and transformation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00595,2022-04-05-T-017,595,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Let me move onto the next point of utilisation of parental leave entitlements. I am supportive of the measures to encourage utilisation of parental leave as this will support employees, both men and women, in caregiving as parents. I fully support the drive for both men and women to be actively involved and share in the responsibilities as parents to care for their children, because I think that is a benefit to not just the sharing of load, but really benefit to families and also benefit to the children and society as a whole. But I want to make a point about maternity leave."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00596,2022-04-05-T-017,596,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"While the purpose of maternity leave is to allow women time to care and bond with their newborn child, let us not forget that maternity leave is also to allow time for women to rest and recover from the physical changes and strains that she went through in the nine months of pregnancy, as well as childbirth. I agree and encourage men to utilise their paternity leave, so that they can share with the care of the child to allow mothers to recover well during their maternity leave."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00597,2022-04-05-T-017,597,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"But let us not forget, when we talk about sharing of leave, sharing of time and all that, let us not forget, women need to take care of themselves. Their bodies have gone through a lot, both physically and mentally. I have three children, and I will tell you, I love all of them, my deliveries were very, very short, my third one was 15 minutes. But I will tell you, the nine months were challenging, your body just goes through a lot and the afterbirth is tough. So, I would say to everyone, do not forget that and, women especially, do not forget that you need to take care of yourself."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00598,2022-04-05-T-017,598,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"So, while actions are important, let me now touch on an equally important point, my final point, on mindsets. This is going to be fairly embarrassing for me, but I thought it would make the point, because it is a personal story. So, I am going to share a personal story about mindsets. Many times, we do not realise our own inherent and sometimes unrecognised stereotypes that we all hold. I personally think that I try my hardest to be quite open-minded, but the pin-drop for me one day – this was a few years ago when I had a very important client and we had arranged for technical briefings and very deep technological briefings for the client with very deep experts coming in and we came to a very important topic – and I was looking around the room when I said to my colleagues  ""Where is the speaker?"" It was very important and I was looking around and we were all looking for the speaker, at the expert. And then, finally, I was told, ""the speaker is in the room"" and we looked around. And then I realised  ""Oh dear, are you sure that is the speaker, can you all please check?"" That is what I said to our team."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00599,2022-04-05-T-017,599,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Well, the speaker came on, spoke and, in my head, I thought it was going to be a disaster, or at least a mediocre session, but it turned out to be a very good session, because the speaker was a deep expert and, not only that, could actually relate it back to my clients' business and relate it back, a very deep technology area."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00600,2022-04-05-T-017,600,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"So, why is this embarrassing? Let me tell you this, in my head, I said that this person could not be the speaker. It was not a gender thing, but it was an age thing. I was looking for someone, because this topic was so complex and still is a very complex area, that I was looking in my head, a deep expert had to be one that ""looked the part"". And the pin dropped for me, because I was so embarrassed and this happened many years ago, and I still cannot forget that, because it is a check for me to say that  ""We do not think we are, we do not think it is, but we do it""; we do it all the time. And that is why, beyond actions, I think mindsets are important."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00601,2022-04-05-T-017,601,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"And I did a check yesterday, and this individual that I am talking about, by the way, is world-renowned, and she is still doing very well, and she is one of the world-renowned experts in this area and she is doing very well in that area."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00602,2022-04-05-T-017,602,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"But let me now come back to this point. Mr Speaker, we all have mental models and biases. To realise the aspirations of enabling a fair and inclusive society for both women and men to achieve our fullest potential and progress together, we must recognise the need to make the mindset shifts, each and every one of us. One of the important points of this White Paper is that it is about all of us and not just about some of us."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00603,2022-04-05-T-017,603,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"So, I encourage all of us to move forward to achieve this aspiration that we have for all of us to realise our full potential."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00604,2022-04-05-T-017,604,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"With that, Mr Speaker, I support the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00605,2022-04-05-T-017,605,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00606,2022-04-05-T-017,606,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, Sir, since July last year, I have been co-chairing the SG Together Sunlight Alliance for Action, or AfA, with my colleague Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam, which tackles online harms targeted mainly at women and girls."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00607,2022-04-05-T-017,607,Sim Ann,"I will elaborate how the Sunlight AfA, which seeks to support the Digital for Life (DfL) movement, tries to close the digital safety gap for women. Ms Rahayu Mahzam will share more about how MCI is responding to calls made by the Sunlight AfA."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00608,2022-04-05-T-017,608,Sim Ann,"Online harms, especially those experienced by women and girls, are not something that can be understood in the abstract."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00609,2022-04-05-T-017,609,Sim Ann,"Not everyone is aware of such online harms or what they look like. Based on a sensing poll conducted by the Sunlight AfA, 31% of respondents have either personally experienced or witnessed gender-based online harms or both."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00610,2022-04-05-T-017,610,Sim Ann,"However, you can feel the devastating impact of such harms on individuals and their families even if you have never been directly targeted. All you need is to listen with an open heart to the story of someone who has gone through such an experience. I have heard several of such tales from personal acquaintances, each of which has remained deeply etched in my mind."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00611,2022-04-05-T-017,611,Sim Ann,"The first that I recall occurred more than 10 years ago. A woman journalist related to me a harrowing experience, where her photos and contact number were posted by a person or persons unknown on websites that falsely profiled her as a prostitute. She was harassed and embarrassed by phone calls from strangers wanting to obtain sexual services from her. She had reason to think that this was part of a campaign by those who wanted to punish her for writing pieces that they disagreed strongly with."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00612,2022-04-05-T-017,612,Sim Ann,"In another episode, a father reached out to me because intimate photos that his daughter had taken of herself had been stolen from her phone and found their way onto blog sites that specialise in collecting and sharing such photos of young Singapore women. He went to great lengths to get the photos taken down. I will always remember his anguish when relating the severe trauma that this had caused his daughter and his fear that he might lose her forever should she do irreparable harm to herself. This is every parent's worst nightmare."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00613,2022-04-05-T-017,613,Sim Ann,"Thankfully, in both cases, the women and their loved ones were able to overcome the harm they experienced and put these terrible episodes behind them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00614,2022-04-05-T-017,614,Sim Ann,"Our laws have been evolving. In 2019, the Protection from Harassment Act, or POHA, was amended to outlaw doxxing, which would address the kind of harassment that the woman journalist had endured. But online harms, too, evolve."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00615,2022-04-05-T-017,615,Sim Ann,"Another common form of such harms is hyper-sexualised communications on direct messaging platforms, typically involving the sending of lewd and sexually explicit photos. These are aimed at eliciting a response from the women and girls being targeted and linked to sexual grooming and eventual exploitation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00616,2022-04-05-T-017,616,Sim Ann,"The impact caused by such online harms can have severe consequences on the victims who are made to feel humiliated and ashamed, violated and unsafe, isolated and withdrawn, depressed and even suicidal. Their families and loved ones are also not spared."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00617,2022-04-05-T-017,617,Sim Ann,How many untold stories of scarred psyches or diminished lives are there? How many women and girls are out there who would never regain their self-confidence and peace of mind?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00618,2022-04-05-T-017,618,Sim Ann,"Hearing about these episodes makes me and many others who care about the well-being of women and girls want to do something about it. This goes beyond our sympathy and indignation on behalf of the victims and their families. There are wider and more insidious implications on society, too."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00619,2022-04-05-T-017,619,Sim Ann,"What do these online harms have in common? They stem from seeing and portraying women and girls, primarily, as playthings, for the sexual gratification of men. This is a deplorable and backward mindset, one that I believe most men do not subscribe to, but is, nonetheless, difficult to eradicate from society completely. It may be rooted in age-old inequalities between the sexes, but is unjustifiable by any modern standard of morality or law."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00620,2022-04-05-T-017,620,Sim Ann,"Generations of women – and men who support women – all over the world have pushed back against this mindset and fought for the dignity and safety of women and girls. Over time, like many other societies, we have developed clear laws and strong enforcement to protect women's safety in real life – against sexual assault, hurt crimes and trafficking. Singapore is now one of the safest cities in the world for women and girls, so much so that many of us take it for granted that we can go about our daily business alone and unaccompanied. Since 2017, we have been ranked first in Gallup's Global Law and Order report."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00621,2022-04-05-T-017,621,Sim Ann,"But the exploitative and backward mindset towards women has found new means of expression in the Internet age. Perpetrators believe they can hide behind the cloak of anonymity. The digital publication and dissemination of information, allows for viralling at speed and the impact on victims becomes more severe and wide-ranging. Such harms can also be weaponised in a malicious and cynical manner to threaten and inflict trauma on individual women. Unsurprisingly, more women than men feel unsafe from gender-based online harms. The sensing poll conducted by the Sunlight AfA found that while 72% of males felt safe from harms while online, only 60% of females did."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00622,2022-04-05-T-017,622,Sim Ann,"If left unchecked, online harms that promote exploitative and disrespectful attitudes towards women and girls may discourage women from being active online. We are not just talking about women deciding to make fewer posts or comments on social media.	But avoiding important and meaningful undertakings, such as leadership roles or advocacy in real life, that might increase one's chances of encountering haters who wield online harms as a weapon. Reduced participation means reduced opportunities. Why should women accept this?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00623,2022-04-05-T-017,623,Sim Ann,"If this mindset is left unchecked, it may erode the real-life safety that women in Singapore have come to rely on, by undermining the value of respecting women and girls as full human beings that we have worked so hard to build up over the generations. Some who are intent on doing real-life harm to women and girls are also availing themselves of online means to identify and isolate their potential victims – hyper-sexualised direct messaging being one of such means."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00624,2022-04-05-T-017,624,Sim Ann,"No society that respects and values women can stand for this, much less one like Singapore where women have achieved so much freedom and confidence in real life."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00625,2022-04-05-T-017,625,Sim Ann,"The digital safety gap must be closed. Our women and girls must feel as safe and confident online as they do in real life. This is, certainly, relevant to many of the topics being discussed in the Conversations on Singapore Women's Development."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00626,2022-04-05-T-017,626,Sim Ann,"Therefore, while I was at MCI, with support from my former colleagues, I decided to make an appeal to those who care equally about women and girls' online safety, so that we can come together and do something about it collectively. I was moved by the number of people who came forward because this cause resonated strongly with them. This included not only women but also men. The number of men reaching out and supporting the AfA affirms and strengthens my belief that men are absolutely vital partners for improving digital safety for women and girls. As fathers, husbands, brothers, sons, friends and colleagues – they care for and want the best for women and girls. This is never about women versus men. This is only ever about women and men working hand-in-hand to push back against mindsets that exploit and victimise women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00627,2022-04-05-T-017,627,Sim Ann,"IPS Senior Research Fellow and Sunlight AfA member Dr Chew Han Ei exemplifies this solidarity. He joined the AfA because he wants to help shift societal mindsets and norms to empower men, as supportive allies of women, to speak out against behaviours that reflect and perpetuate retrograde and exploitative mindsets about women. These are men and women who recognise that online harms, which men and boys may similarly encounter, cannot be dealt with solely via Government action in the form of greater regulation and enforcement. The Government's role is necessary but not sufficient."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00628,2022-04-05-T-017,628,Sim Ann,"Concerted efforts from the public, private and people sectors, to formulate approaches to victim support, undertake public education and engagement, and have Internet companies step up to do their part are also needed. Indeed, groups like the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO), United Women Singapore, TOUCH Community Services and AWARE are among the organisations that AfA members hail from. I also wish to express my gratitude to the many officers from MCI who believe in the cause and contributed so much of their time and effort to provide the AfA with secretariat support."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00629,2022-04-05-T-017,629,Sim Ann,"Since its launch in July 2021, the AfA has administered a survey to understand the incidence and impact of online harms in Singapore, engaged over 240 parents and youths to raise awareness about online harms and impart tips on how they can help their loved ones navigate the digital space safely, launched a website containing informational resources about online risks and safety tools on technology platforms."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00630,2022-04-05-T-017,630,Sim Ann,"What has been particularly encouraging to the AfA members is that the Government is responding to the calls we have been making, by introducing Codes of Practice for Internet platforms. Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam will share more on this later."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00631,2022-04-05-T-017,631,Sim Ann,The AfA will roll out more initiatives in the coming months to empower individuals to recognise online harms and build a more holistic system of support for victims. These include a workshop to equip youths to support peers who may be experiencing online harms and a pilot to provide counselling intervention to victims of online harms.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00632,2022-04-05-T-017,632,Sim Ann,We will work with community partners to develop public education initiatives to drive awareness about online harms and promote digital safety.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00633,2022-04-05-T-017,633,Sim Ann,"Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam and I are grateful for the support of all alliance members, including those who expressed interest in sustaining initiatives in the longer term. The AfA has been a platform for many of our members to forge new friendships and explore common areas of interest, including wider advocacy for the protection and advancement of women and girls, beyond tackling online harms. I am encouraged and look forward to new engines of activism in our society in support of women and girls."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00634,2022-04-05-T-017,634,Sim Ann,"Beyond the AfA, we have seen the cause attract wide resonance. The People's Action Party Women’s Wing adopted the theme of tackling online harms for its International Women's Day activation for 2022. It partnered lawyers and counsellors to roll out a resource toolkit to equip branch volunteers to be good listeners and helpful responders when members of the public bring up issues relating to online harms during Meet-the-People Sessions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00635,2022-04-05-T-017,635,Sim Ann,"More broadly, we welcome interested community partners to join the Digital for Life movement. There is room for many of us to amplify efforts to build a safer digital future for all."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00636,2022-04-05-T-017,636,Sim Ann,"Very recently, Straits Times journalist Malavika Menon wrote courageously about her personal encounter with online harms, including that of a sexist nature. Her piece reminded me of that first conversation I had, all those years ago, with a different woman journalist. Back then, I felt upset for her, but did not yet have a clear idea of what can be done to tackle such online harms and defend the dignity and confidence of women online."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00637,2022-04-05-T-017,637,Sim Ann,"I believe we have a roadmap now, which is constantly being expanded and refined, thanks to the partnership and collective wisdom of the women and men who stepped forth to join our AfA, and all those who are committed to uplift digital safety for Singapore women and girls. The digital safety gap can be closed for our women and girls. Let us make it happen."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00638,2022-04-05-T-017,638,Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00639,2022-04-05-T-017,639,Leon Perera,"Mr Speaker, Sir, like Member of Parliament for Sengkang Ms He Ting Ru and my Workers' Party colleagues in the House, I support the Motion. We all share the goal of a gender-equal society. For us in the Workers' Party, this is a very important goal, which is why Ms He Ting Ru and I moved the Motion in this House on gender equality last year."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00640,2022-04-05-T-017,640,Leon Perera,"Personally, what keeps me invested in this ideal is when I think about my family members – my wife, my mother, my daughter and also my son – and how I want them to live in a society where every individual is judged not by their gender but solely by the content of their character – to paraphrase something that Dr Martin Luther King Junior said in the context of race."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00641,2022-04-05-T-017,641,Leon Perera,"While we broadly agree on the end goal, we have some differences in our approaches to define and, ultimately, achieve that goal, which is why, in our speeches in this debate, we are focusing on where we see gaps in the White Paper and where we have different views and policies."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00642,2022-04-05-T-017,642,Leon Perera,"Sir, in my speech today, I shall focus on four topics related to the goal of moving towards a truly gender-equal society. Firstly, changing mindsets to strive against sexism and towards gender equality in everyday behaviours and shared cultures. Secondly, policy responses to the problem of sexual harassment. Thirdly, transparent time-based structural rules to enable foreign spouses with Singaporean children, who are mostly women, to move towards Permanent Residency (PR) status and citizenship – and extending that point, a more predictable and transparent points-based immigration regime. And fourthly, in the spirit of gender equality, changes to our laws on spousal maintenance to be fairer to house-husbands and men who have less income and assets than their wives in the event of a divorce."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00643,2022-04-05-T-017,643,Leon Perera,"Firstly, Sir, on changing mindsets and culture. In my Motion speech last year, I spoke about the challenges facing us on this front. Online, we do still see views from some quarters stating that moves towards gender equality and fairness for women reflect ""misandry"" or the hatred of men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00644,2022-04-05-T-017,644,Leon Perera,"Mr Speaker, Sir, just last month, the South Korean presidential election was won by a candidate who had, among other things, campaigned on a platform that some described as ""anti-feminist"". He had reportedly called for the abolition of Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and had blamed the country's low birth rate on ""feminism"". This is a sobering turn of events, though it should be noted that the victory was by the narrowest of margins, with some Korean gender equality activists suggesting that the result showed that the momentum was on their side."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00645,2022-04-05-T-017,645,Leon Perera,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to be absolutely clear. I cite this example not to argue that we should not go too far or too fast so as not to provoke a backlash from those with different views. On the contrary, my Workers' Party colleagues and I argue that we should be bold and ambitious in our gender equality strides. A great deal is at stake, including the empowerment to lead full lives and contribute back to society of half the population."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00646,2022-04-05-T-017,646,Leon Perera,"I bring up the Korean example to emphasise the importance of having conversations with Singaporean men and, perhaps, some women who may not fully buy into the vision of gender equality as well, to convince them that society moving in this direction is fair, right and not a threat to them. We have to carry all Singaporeans on this journey. We must not allow anti-gender equality sentiments to fester and brew into something more bitter and more sinister."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00647,2022-04-05-T-017,647,Leon Perera,"Sir, in the last speech I made on this, I put forward some suggestions on how to change mindsets. I would like to put forward another suggestion here."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00648,2022-04-05-T-017,648,Leon Perera,The Government can support non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and think tanks in conducting rigorous regular research and publishing the results about the areas in life where women still face inequality – from the unequal burden of housework and domestic violence to sexist discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace and on campus.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00649,2022-04-05-T-017,649,Leon Perera,"All of us in this House can and should help publicise such data, as should other stakeholders like NGOs, trade associations and chambers and student groups. Such data being widely accepted can help individual Singaporeans have informed conversations with other Singaporeans to move the needle on mindsets."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00650,2022-04-05-T-017,650,Leon Perera,"In truth, the battle for mindsets was never mainly about policies. It is about us as a people keeping an open mind to new facts, research and trends, being willing to relook at established conventions and winning people over, one person at a time. We all have a role to play in this journey. If every person who believes in gender equality can change the mind of just one person who harbours sexist thinking, whether man or woman, a revolution in our culture and thinking will be achievable within this generation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00651,2022-04-05-T-017,651,Leon Perera,"Next, Sir, my second topic. I would like to talk about the issue of sexual harassment."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00652,2022-04-05-T-017,652,Leon Perera,"Here, I am not referring to violent or physical abuse, such as rape or molest, which is addressable under the laws that exist, but to verbal abuse and inappropriate behaviour, lewd and derogatory comments or instructions given in the workplace or on campuses, for example."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00653,2022-04-05-T-017,653,Leon Perera,"To cite an AWARE report on gender equality released on 28 July last year, ""According to the results of a 2020 Ipsos-AWARE national survey, two in five workers in Singapore have experienced workplace sexual harassment in the past five years, including being on the receiving end of crude sexual and sexist remarks and being touched physically in ways that made them feel distress or alarm."" So, this is not an insignificant problem."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00654,2022-04-05-T-017,654,Leon Perera,"Victims of sexual harassment can go to Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) but the role of TAFEP, currently, would appear to be limited to interceding with the victim's employer to put in place better anti-sexual harassment policies and to deploy its own disciplinary and internal dispute handling procedures as a company."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00655,2022-04-05-T-017,655,Leon Perera,"Victims can also pursue recourse through the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) Court, filing a Magistrate's Complaint or through litigation, which is costly and time-consuming, which would deter many victims, especially since victims may often be disadvantaged in terms of power or socioeconomic status vis-a-vis male perpetrators."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00656,2022-04-05-T-017,656,Leon Perera,"Moreover, in the absence of any legislation defining sexual harassment of the employer's liability for the same, the outcome of such legal action is uncertain."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00657,2022-04-05-T-017,657,Leon Perera,"Other countries have used legislative tools to tackle this issue. This can be found in the UK Equality Act and in the US. Malaysia amended its Employment Act to specifically define and criminalise acts of sexual harassment in 2014. Malaysian law defines sexual harassment as ""any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, whether verbal, nonverbal, visual, gestural or physical, directed at a person, which is offensive, humiliating or a threat to their wellbeing"". Under this law, both men and women can commit acts of sexual harassment."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00658,2022-04-05-T-017,658,Leon Perera,"Sir, sexual harassment is a complex issue and it can cause a great deal of discomfort to men who are confused as to how social mores have changed and where to draw the line, a point that my colleague for Sengkang, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, will allude to."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00659,2022-04-05-T-017,659,Leon Perera,I do not suggest a rush to legislate right now but would make three suggestions here as steps to consider taking before considering the issue of legislation.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00660,2022-04-05-T-017,660,Leon Perera,"Firstly, the Government should consider how best to nudge employers to adopt in their respective corporate handbooks guidelines on workplace sexual harassment based on existing TAFEP guidelines or international best practices. For example, can this not be a requirement or a plus point when awarding certain large Government contracts and economic incentives?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00661,2022-04-05-T-017,661,Leon Perera,"Secondly, can the Government conduct and publish more research on the subject of workplace and campus sexual harassment so as to quantify the impact of better guidelines and other factors on the problem?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00662,2022-04-05-T-017,662,Leon Perera,"Thirdly, can the MOE be more prescriptive in requiring Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to adhere to certain baseline minimal standards of compliance with respect to sexual harassment? These will include implementing a national code of conduct for IHLs as well as ensuring comprehensive sexuality education that includes the concepts of respecting consent."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00663,2022-04-05-T-017,663,Leon Perera,"In Taiwan, for example, as cited in the AWARE report I mentioned, the government has enacted the Gender Equity Education Act, which, specifically, addresses the problem of gender-based bullying, which is referred to as sexual bullying, under the Act."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00664,2022-04-05-T-017,664,Leon Perera,"Sir, I would like now to move on to the third topic in my speech, which is the immigration status of foreign spouses."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00665,2022-04-05-T-017,665,Leon Perera,"Sir, I will not need to remind Members of the House about the problem of foreign spouses who are mothers of Singaporean children and who sometimes grapple with the insecurity caused by their uncertain immigration status in Singapore, having to renew Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or social visit passes at regular intervals with no assurance of success and with uncertain prospects of achieving PR or citizenship status in the longer term in spite of their role as parents and families with Singaporean kids."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00666,2022-04-05-T-017,666,Leon Perera,"All of us, I am quite sure I can say this, have dealt with such cases among our constituents. I dealt with one such case recently in the Serangoon ward of Aljunied GRC and I would like to share it."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00667,2022-04-05-T-017,667,Leon Perera,"Olivia – not her real name, of course – is a foreign national on LTVP. She was married to a Singaporean husband. They are parents to a Singaporean girl, Anna – also not her real name. Anna is in Primary 4 at one of our schools. She struck me as being just like my own daughter at that age."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00668,2022-04-05-T-017,668,Leon Perera,"Unfortunately, the father passed away. At his wake, I met both Olivia and Anna. I took down their details so as to write appeals in aspect of Olivia's continued LTVP status since she does not have a living husband as a sponsor any longer; and in respect of their continued stay in an HDB public rental flat since the family is of very low income – and, in fact, now has no income at all – since Olivia does not work, though she would now want to and need to."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00669,2022-04-05-T-017,669,Leon Perera,"Sir, I feel very emotional thinking about both of them. Olivia will have to start working even though she faces uncertainty as to her immigration status and ability to work in future as renewals of permits are never assured even though she is the mother of the Singaporean child; and Anna, who is part of a family unit with the mother and whose mother faces all of this uncertainty while having to raise her single-handedly."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00670,2022-04-05-T-017,670,Leon Perera,"Sir, one in four marriages involving at least one Singapore Citizen is between a Singapore Citizen and non-resident foreigner, meaning that the spouse is not a PR or Singapore Citizen. Seventy percent of such spouses are women. So, this issue has a gender dimension."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00671,2022-04-05-T-017,671,Leon Perera,"To quote from the July 2021 AWARE report once again, ""the latest publicly available data shows that from 2012 to 2016, 13,900 migrant spouses of Singapore Citizens were granted LTVP out of 16,600 applications. A national study on cross-national families found that 55% of the 655 foreign-born mothers interviewed had attained permanent residency and 26% had become Singapore Citizens after an average of eight years of marriage, but 17% of them still held LTVP or LTVP+. This suggests that many such couples have to deal with the stresses and difficulties arising from uncertain residency status for almost a decade before the migrant spouse acquires PR or citizenship. For female migrant spouses, in particular, this means years of insecurity, compounding their vulnerability to family violence."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00672,2022-04-05-T-017,672,Leon Perera,"According to an earlier Parliamentary Question reply in this House, 98% of LTVP renewals sponsored by non-spouses are approved but this still leaves uncertainty on the part of the spouse who loses a Singapore Citizen spouse or whose Singaporean spouse no longer wants to sponsor her LTVP application. Moreover, LTVP is not a stable status and does not amount to residency, subject, as it is, to regular renewal after short-time intervals."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00673,2022-04-05-T-017,673,Leon Perera,"The time taken for foreign spouses to become citizens and the uncertainty surrounding this have implications for, firstly, stress and mental well-being, as uncertainty clouds their ability to plan their lives. This may also affect the well-being of their Singaporean children."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00674,2022-04-05-T-017,674,Leon Perera,"Second, access to housing options open to citizens and PRs. Though rental housing can be granted to non-citizens, the perception – and usually, the reality – is that it is harder for such cases."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00675,2022-04-05-T-017,675,Leon Perera,"Third, access to legal employment, which may lead them to take up cash-based forms of employment that do not have a legal basis, which will leave them vulnerable to exploitation with no legal recourse. Not all foreign spouses have LTVP+ or MOM's approval to work. Would it not be beneficial to tap on this pool of manpower for our economy since these individuals are living in Singapore anyway?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00676,2022-04-05-T-017,676,Leon Perera,"Fourth, access to certain forms of social welfare assistance reserved for citizens and PRs, as with housing."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00677,2022-04-05-T-017,677,Leon Perera,"Fifth, access to subsidies for primary healthcare, which may inhibit behaviours, such as seeking medical treatment and going for health screening, and which may have an impact on the health of the wider community if LTVP holders succumb to communicable diseases, for example."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00678,2022-04-05-T-017,678,Leon Perera,"Sixth, enhanced vulnerability to domestic violence since the perception remains that it is harder to get a renewal of LTVP without spousal sponsorship. AWARE has cited evidence of cases where the husband threatens to cancel the LTVP if the wife reports domestic violence."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00679,2022-04-05-T-017,679,Leon Perera,"This is why, in its General Election 2020 manifesto, the Workers' Party called for a clear, transparent and time-based fast-track path to citizenship for foreign spouses who are parents of Singaporean children. I repeat this call here."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00680,2022-04-05-T-017,680,Leon Perera,I would like to extend this into a more general point and call for a more transparent regime in evaluating applications for citizenship.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00681,2022-04-05-T-017,681,Leon Perera,"In a previous reply to a Parliamentary Question, the Government outlined its rationale for not instituting a more transparent system for evaluating citizenship applications. Two reasons were given  not wanting people to ""game the system"" and not wanting foreign nationals to accuse the Government publicly of unfairness."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00682,2022-04-05-T-017,682,Leon Perera,"It is true that most countries do not grant immigration rights automatically to foreign spouses of citizens. However, many other countries publish transparent material for such decisions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00683,2022-04-05-T-017,683,Leon Perera,"The criteria for a UK spouse visa, for instance, states that the applicant and spouse must have a combined income of at least £18,600 a year, among other requirements. The subsequent application for permanent residency includes a ""Life in the UK"" test to demonstrate good knowledge of the country's language and lifestyle."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00684,2022-04-05-T-017,684,Leon Perera,"In Germany, the criteria include specific language proficiency levels in the passing of the citizenship test."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00685,2022-04-05-T-017,685,Leon Perera,"New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the UK are examples of countries with transparent criteria and a points-based immigration system. The criteria, typically, cover age, level of education, appropriate skills and work experience, a job offer and proficiency in the local language."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00686,2022-04-05-T-017,686,Leon Perera,"In New Zealand, having close family members is also one of the criteria that is taken into account."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00687,2022-04-05-T-017,687,Leon Perera,"Sir, on the argument that we do not want people to game the system, if we have a points-based system that prioritises those with a clearly better claim to be citizens, will that not attract and encourage the right applicants exhibiting the right qualifications and behaviours that we want? For example, we can institute more points for skillsets in short supply in our economy."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00688,2022-04-05-T-017,688,Leon Perera,"To revisit a subject I have previously spoken about at some length in this House, to get more Singaporeans into good redesigned trade jobs like carpentry and plumbing, for example, one approach – not the only approach by any means – is to convert experienced foreign craftsmen and trades experts into citizens."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00689,2022-04-05-T-017,689,Leon Perera,"As for the argument that foreigners should not be able to stir up anti-Singapore sentiments if there is no systemic national bias in granting citizenship, as one assumes there is not, this should not be an issue with a transparent points-based system. Opacity, on the other hand, can just as easily fuel such sentiments."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00690,2022-04-05-T-017,690,Leon Perera,Some may say that more transparency may encourage foreigners to marry Singaporeans in an exploitative and cynical fashion solely to gain an assured pathway to citizenship.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00691,2022-04-05-T-017,691,Leon Perera,"But not having transparency does not appear to have deterred Singaporeans from marrying foreigners and having children in very significant numbers. All the current regime does is create uncertainty for the foreign spouse and the mother of Singaporean children and, hence, for the family and the children themselves."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00692,2022-04-05-T-017,692,Leon Perera,"Sir, I would argue that non-transparency does not curb the phenomenon of Singaporeans marrying foreign spouses. It only makes things worse for everyone after the fact."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00693,2022-04-05-T-017,693,Leon Perera,The advantages of a points-based immigration system include the following.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00694,2022-04-05-T-017,694,Leon Perera,"First, creating predictability and a perception of fairness and transparency, better enabling participants in our national life to make decisions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00695,2022-04-05-T-017,695,Leon Perera,"Second, attracting and encouraging the right applicants, for example, those with skills in short supply."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00696,2022-04-05-T-017,696,Leon Perera,"Third, creating a dynamic system that can be adjusted, for example, based on labour market needs, with those adjustments being publicly signalled and, hence, influencing citizenship application behaviour in a positive way."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00697,2022-04-05-T-017,697,Leon Perera,"Fourth, within such a system, foreign spouses of Singaporean children can be given clear, transparent, time-based pathways to PR status and citizenship via a points system, without having to depend on a ""black box"" evaluation process which breeds uncertainty and an inability to plan ahead."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00698,2022-04-05-T-017,698,Leon Perera,"Sir, the arguments used against a transparent points-based system for immigration could also be used against instituting such a system for Employment Passes. But with the advent of COMPASS, we have taken a major step in that direction for the Employment Pass regime. There is no reason why we should not do the same for our immigration regime."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00699,2022-04-05-T-017,699,Leon Perera,"Lastly, Sir, the fourth and last topic I would like to touch on, and in the spirit of gender equality, I would like to call for changes to our spousal maintenance laws to foster more fairness to certain types of men who may be at a disadvantage under section 69 of the Women’s Charter in the event of a divorce."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00700,2022-04-05-T-017,700,Leon Perera,"In the Women’s Charter debate earlier this year, the Government said it has considered the possibility of allowing maintenance applications to be made for husbands without the condition of incapacity. Its position on section 69 was that there was no need for such gender-neutral legislation because there is a higher chance of women giving up their careers to get involved in care work while the partner continues working."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00701,2022-04-05-T-017,701,Leon Perera,"I would like to revisit this point because it ties back to our argument that while progress is being made to empower the majority of women in Singapore, there are whole groups of people being left behind and these include non-citizen women living in Singapore, certain types of them, but also men who are doing exactly the same type of unpaid care work which many Members of Parliament spoke about today."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00702,2022-04-05-T-017,702,Leon Perera,"The example was cited in this House of a 2014 media report on a man who was ordered to pay $70,000 in maintenance despite the fact that he was a retiree, the ex-wife earned more than him and he paid the mortgage for their home."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00703,2022-04-05-T-017,703,Leon Perera,"In developed countries, approaches to spousal maintenance vary, with some countries like England giving generous maintenance to the financially weaker party and others focusing on time-limited maintenance, so that the spouse can get back into the workforce. I recognise that the specifics will continue to be debated more fully at some point in time, but one common idea I support is that, regardless of sex, a spouse must be able to file for maintenance without the requirement for incapacitation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00704,2022-04-05-T-017,704,Leon Perera,Why do I say this?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00705,2022-04-05-T-017,705,Leon Perera,"One, it should not be the case that we decide this law on what tends to happen, but rather, what can happen, especially as the current cohort of young adults has reached a point where a higher proportion of women than men have post-Secondary educational qualifications. It will not be a rare situation, going forward, that couples decide that the husband should be giving up his job to take on care work because he earns less or for some other reason."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00706,2022-04-05-T-017,706,Leon Perera,"Second, at the very least, we should not bind the Courts in granting maintenance."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00707,2022-04-05-T-017,707,Leon Perera,"And my third point here also concludes my speech. If we agree today that, in principle, we want to expand recognition, legal support and improve autonomy in care work, then, in the name of fairness, we must ensure that this is also so when things go poorly, that we provide a route for compensation for all care work, be it the contributions of men and non-citizen women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00708,2022-04-05-T-017,708,Speaker,Mr Gan Thiam Poh.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00709,2022-04-05-T-017,709,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the proposals to introduce new workplace fairness legislation to ensure that women are not discriminated against. However, we must also acknowledge that we continue to receive feedback that there are employers, large and small, who discriminate against women who are pregnant."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00710,2022-04-05-T-017,710,Gan Thiam Poh,"How will the Government facilitate and encourage employers to adopt fair practices to hire pregnant staff? Will we be able to include such fair practices as part of the MOM framework in the consideration of the application of EP and other work passes? It would be good to have a platform to highlight companies with fair practices with regular testimonies by their staff and, perhaps, as part of the consideration of the Best Employer Award."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00711,2022-04-05-T-017,711,Gan Thiam Poh,"Would the Government look into having legislation to enshrine FWAs, such as early release of staff with children, so that they could pick up their children from childcare or spend more quality family time?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00712,2022-04-05-T-017,712,Gan Thiam Poh,"I appreciate the action plan to entrench FWAs as a workplace norm. Our experience during the pandemic has proven that it can work very well, with benefits for both employees and employers, as well as the environment, as we cut down on commutes to the office. To nudge hesitant employers and companies, I would like to suggest that the Government consider enticing companies that implement FWAs with privileges like a higher foreign worker quota or a co-payment element like Workfare. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00713,2022-04-05-T-017,713,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, each of us has at least one important person in our life. She is our mother. Mother is great. They hold us in their wombs for nine months and take good care of us as we grow up. As the saying goes, women hold up half the sky. We cannot ignore their contribution and importance."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00714,2022-04-05-T-017,714,Gan Thiam Poh,"We must also put ourselves in their shoes and understand the challenges and pressures they face. Sometimes, you cannot have the best of both worlds and you have to give up certain things and make sacrifices."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00715,2022-04-05-T-017,715,Gan Thiam Poh,"But we cannot dismiss their sacrifices and take it for granted. We cannot have the cake and eat it. Therefore, we all have the responsibility to do our best to support and encourage them. Unity is important."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00716,2022-04-05-T-017,716,Gan Thiam Poh,"I am grateful to the Government for the great support it has given to low-income families over the years, including giving them a substantial subsidy for childcare. MOE also provides free breakfasts to those disadvantaged children. I hope the Government can also increase the childcare subsidy for children in the sandwiched middle- and low-income families to further assist them and ease their burden. This will help mothers who have to juggle work to supplement their household income. I also hope that the Government will consider giving subsidies to mothers who are unable to join the workforce due to difficult circumstances."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00717,2022-04-05-T-017,717,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In English)  Sir, next, the focus of this White Paper regarding caregiving has been on recognition and support for caregivers. The enhanced respite care options and Home Caregiving Grant and the broadened scope of the Household Services Scheme are all excellent proposals. But these may not apply directly to certain families, who need to depend on migrant domestic workers for caregiving and yet cannot afford to do so. Would the Ministry consider some form of subsidy to lessen their financial burden or even waive the maid levy entirely?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00718,2022-04-05-T-017,718,Gan Thiam Poh,"Would the Ministry consider additional necessary support, including financial help, for young children with challenging illnesses who come from dysfunctional families or are being cared for by divorced single moms, such as by ring-fencing partial funds from their fathers’ CPF accounts, for their healthcare expenses?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00719,2022-04-05-T-017,719,Gan Thiam Poh,"Although the current CPF Act does stipulate the existence of a special trust account, the Courts have no power under the legislation to direct and/or to set aside amounts from their fathers’ accounts to help pay for the healthcare expenses of these children during the divorce proceedings or when the families are abandoned by the fathers. With that, I support the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00720,2022-04-05-T-017,720,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00721,2022-04-05-T-017,721,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I had, during the Workers' Party Motion on this matter last year in this House, spoken about a number of concerns about gender equality in the workplace."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00722,2022-04-05-T-017,722,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To quickly recap, I had explained why womenomics in Singapore still had a way to go. Married men are employed 1.3 times more than women. Yet, women earn 14% less. I had also suggested a number of practical steps to promote greater gender equality. These include reservations for female representation on board memberships in GLCs, increasing the coverage of childcare and primary schooling facilities in demographically young estates, paid re-entry programmes for mothers and informal caregivers, and publishing aggregated and average pay gap information by industry sector."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00723,2022-04-05-T-017,723,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Today, I wish to share a number of reactions in response to the White Paper on Women's Development. Consistent with my earlier speech, I will focus on Area 1 of the White Paper on ""Equal Opportunities in the Workplace""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00724,2022-04-05-T-017,724,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The Report highlights three action plans to improve female labour force participation  FWAs, career mentorship and flexible leave entitlements. I will share about each of these separately."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00725,2022-04-05-T-017,725,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Currently, MOM parental paid leave provisions amount up to 18 weeks paid, of which six weeks may be taken up by fathers. The White Paper suggests that this could amount to up to 22 weeks with the father's eligible share bumped up to eight weeks. While I think I can reverse engineer this figure essentially by adding up unpaid as well as paid infant care leave for each parent, perhaps the Government would be willing to clarify exactly how this discrepancy arises."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00726,2022-04-05-T-017,726,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Regardless of the calculations, while a move towards greater shared leave provisions, undoubtedly, represents an improvement, the policy still remains voluntary. Employers are only asked to consider FWAs ""fairly and properly"". The only concession is that the consumption period for additional unpaid infant care leave will be extended for those in the Public Service from ""within the first"" to ""the first two years""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00727,2022-04-05-T-017,727,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As my friend Sengkang Member of Parliament Louis Chua will note in his speech, the Workers' Party has, in our manifesto, explicitly called for a different shared parental leave scheme of 24 weeks with a minimum of half of this to be granted to the mother, and a sixth to the father. On its face, these may seem to be distinctions without differences – 22 versus 24 weeks, a maximum of eight weeks versus a minimum of four weeks to be granted to the father."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00728,2022-04-05-T-017,728,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But if you will indulge me, there is, in fact, a material difference. By imposing a maximum that the father can take, the law, as currently construed, embeds, if you will, an implicit assumption that the father is, in fact, the primary breadwinner. What if there is a couple where the woman out-earns the man? In this case, it would be financially rational for the woman to be the one returning to work while the man remains at home providing childcare. Fixing a maximum of eight weeks for the father will preclude this possibility."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00729,2022-04-05-T-017,729,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Of course, this is not to deny the physiological changes a woman's body undergoes following delivery. And it is undeniably important that the body be allowed to rest and recover from the rigours of childbirth, lest the doctors in this House correct me on this. Research has shown, however, that the postpartum period can be divided into three distinct phases, with the second sub-acute phase where the body undergoes major changes in hemodynamics, genital urinary recovery, metabolism and emotional status lasting between two and six weeks. Postpartum depression would also, typically, present itself within this timeframe. This is why a 12-week minimum for the father makes sense, without ruling out the father as the primary caregiver thereafter."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00730,2022-04-05-T-017,730,Jamus Jerome Lim,"We should also recognise that just taking additional leave, even when fully justified and accounted for, is not entirely costless. Being away from the office for a longer period will inadvertently delay or, perhaps, inhibit career progression and this is especially the case for mothers who end up utilising more of the leave entitlement. This is another reason why minimum paternal leave requirements can also indirectly help limit the gender wage gap from rising even further."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00731,2022-04-05-T-017,731,Jamus Jerome Lim,"More generally, the report calls for FWAs to be boosted to cover 40% of all employees by the end of 2022 but does not offer any similar commitment for the expansion of coverage of FWAs in the public sector, only stating that the public sector will ""take the lead"". May I clarify that the Government will, in fact, be committing to attaining the 40% target for those in the Public Service?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00732,2022-04-05-T-017,732,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While I applaud the effort to expand mentorship, I have mixed feelings about how far mentorship can take us. Do not get me wrong. I am a mentor, both voluntarily and professionally, to students, and I see the enormous value that close mentorship can offer. This can be a wonderful idea if there are already sufficient women in positions of influence across a broad range of organisations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00733,2022-04-05-T-017,733,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But this is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. If potential female mentors available remain small in number, we run the risk of either over-taxing this limited pool of mentors or a failure to break into spaces where women are currently under-represented. What is worse, we pile additional stress on this group, which may even, inadvertently, inhibit their continued career progression, because they have become preoccupied with non-professional commitments."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00734,2022-04-05-T-017,734,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The solution, it would seem, would be to encourage male mentors to step up. This is certainly possible, but we would also do well to recognise the more challenging climate men face when asked to mentor the opposite gender. In a post-#Me-Too world, men have often become very cautious in both their language and advice, for fear of being accused of sexual harassment. They may choose to withhold their most strident criticism, even if such critique may be constructive, or refrain from banter, for fear of being perceived as sexist."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00735,2022-04-05-T-017,735,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This point was made by Anne Clarke Wolff, the founder and CEO of Independence Point Advisors, a women-owned investment bank and advisory, sometimes known in the business as “Salomon Sisters.” In an interview, Ms Wolff explained that the forces that led women to exit high-stress, high-remuneration jobs, such as those in finance, were not because they favoured shorter hours or lower commitment; au contraire, they left because they felt excluded. This absence of camaraderie may be ameliorated by genuine mentorship. This is built over social settings, like drinks and dinner. But many men today would be very uncomfortable engaging in such activities, even when above board, with someone of the opposite gender."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00736,2022-04-05-T-017,736,Jamus Jerome Lim,"One is also left to wonder just how such opportunities would apply to women in more blue-collar or non-professional occupations. After all, the origin of apprenticeships was to transfer artisanal skills in trades work. Will the mentorship and networking plan apply with equal force to lower-wage domains and occupations?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00737,2022-04-05-T-017,737,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The report takes the position that, while it wishes to encourage and support women in achieving their leadership potential, it shuns tokenism and, in particular, the ""unintended consequences… [of] imposing hard quotas."" On its face, this principle is surely indisputable; even champions of greater empowerment are likely to be uncomfortable with being granted a seat at the table, only by dint of their gender."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00738,2022-04-05-T-017,738,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, my concern is that this principled approach downplays the recent research on mandated representation and the role that it can play in shifting longstanding behavioural biases."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00739,2022-04-05-T-017,739,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In one study, when gender quotas are randomly assigned – this is the gold standard for causal inference – in village councils in India, the prior exposure to a female leader gives rise to subsequent lasting electoral gains. In particular, perceptions of effectiveness of a female leader improves and gender stereotypes about the roles of women in public versus domestic spheres weaken."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00740,2022-04-05-T-017,740,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In another study, mandated board representation in Norway led to an improved likelihood that women would, subsequently, secure leadership. After the advent of such quotas, gender gaps between males and females in terms of qualifications would also diminish and a female CEO would also be more likely to be appointed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00741,2022-04-05-T-017,741,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thus, when mandated representation is actually pursued, both theory and evidence emphatically reject the notion that quotas would most likely be ineffectual. Because quotas could improve talent allocation by overturning historical instances where such groups may have been deliberately excluded. After all, nobody truly believes that being a man predisposes one to computer engineering, data science or finance."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00742,2022-04-05-T-017,742,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Overall, the body of evidence suggests that reforms of this nature have been successful in reducing historical inequalities, and power and norms do shift permanently, even in response to temporary interventions. All this points to something that is just as intuitive as a rejection of tokenism; that rebalancing the position of disadvantaged groups requires concrete corrective action, even if only for a season, to permanently shift attitudes and perceptions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00743,2022-04-05-T-017,743,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Indeed, in countries that have moved to embrace gender quotas on corporate boards, there has been greater enthusiasm for such quotas, as well as more professional and formal approaches to board selection. Even in countries where there are no quotas, there is a growing recognition that market forces will not fix the problem on its own."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00744,2022-04-05-T-017,744,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Undoubtedly, we should not go overboard with trying to squeeze round pegs into square holes. The evidence also suggests that firm valuations may suffer excessively when the existing gap between mandated and actual representation is larger, or when the costs of compliance are too great, due to the firm being too small to cope."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00745,2022-04-05-T-017,745,Jamus Jerome Lim,"That is why a limited quota could be a viable way forward. This would be akin to, say, a voluntary target of a third of board seats being held by women and holding this target for a temporary period of 10 years. It would only apply to the largest firms, thereby minimising the compliance costs for small corporations. And a third seems eminently attainable, given how female representation is currently about 18%; this would amount to a doubling from the present share."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00746,2022-04-05-T-017,746,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Here, again, the public sector can be the one to take the lead. Even if we do not wish to excessively tie the hands of employers, will the Government at least ensure that all Government-linked firms aspire to this voluntary target? And will the Government consider requiring board-level training on unconscious gender biases, similar to the current requirement that board members undergo one-time training on sustainability, for all listed corporations?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00747,2022-04-05-T-017,747,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, about a decade ago, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, now Meta, co-authored a book entitled ""Lean In"". The book, which went on to spark a brief movement, explained how she believed that women had to be bold and embrace self-promotion, in order to succeed in the workplace. This thesis has come under some criticism since, but the central metaphor – the need to be proactive in pushing for a seat at the table – applies, in my view, to how we should be advancing pro-women policy in our nation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00748,2022-04-05-T-017,748,Jamus Jerome Lim,"It is in this spirit that I have found the action points outlined in the White Paper to betray a somewhat lack of ambition. To be clear, the report represents a positive step in advancing the cause of true gender equality in the workplace."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00749,2022-04-05-T-017,749,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Hence, while I support the Motion, I have found the report to be sanguine in the role that the Government, through the Public Service, can play in ushering in such positive changes in the workplace. Charity, surely, begins at home, and the deafening silence on how the demonstration effect of Government leadership by rolling out the proposed actions decisively within the Civil Service strikes me as inexplicable and, honestly, somewhat peculiar."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00750,2022-04-05-T-017,750,Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00751,2022-04-05-T-017,751,Sylvia Lim,"Mr Speaker, my focus today will be on Area 3, ""Taking a strong stance against violence and harm"". I will, thereafter, make two observations about workplace culture and public policymaking."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00752,2022-04-05-T-017,752,Sylvia Lim,"First, violence, family violence. I welcome the Government's recognition that there is a need to enhance protection for victim-survivors of family violence. The extent of family violence tends to be significantly under-reported worldwide. We can understand why this is so for reasons ranging from emotional attachment to the perpetrator, to not wishing to incarcerate a breadwinner. To that end, I was glad to see the footnote on page 49 of the White Paper, which recognises the need to look at self-reported data to supplement official data if we are to have a clearer picture of the prevalence of domestic violence."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00753,2022-04-05-T-017,753,Sylvia Lim,"The White Paper affirms, among other things, that there is a need to strengthen societal attitudes against family violence and enhance preventive efforts for persons at risk. It was also stated that, for victims, reporting of family violence should be made easier and that immediate help should be available to reduce the risk of repeat violence. As for perpetrators, the White Paper affirmed the need to increase perpetrators' accountability and rehabilitation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00754,2022-04-05-T-017,754,Sylvia Lim,I would like to add my perspective on some areas that I believe will be critical in making a difference on the ground. This is in particular reference to Action 13 on enhancing protection for victim-survivors of family violence.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00755,2022-04-05-T-017,755,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, the response and attitude of law enforcement to reports of family violence are critical. It was stated at page 54 that, moving forward, the team responding to cases of family violence will include social service professionals."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00756,2022-04-05-T-017,756,Sylvia Lim,"I do agree that tackling family violence benefits from a comprehensive approach. At the same time, I am concerned that the proposed multidisciplinary first response may, inadvertently, result in a Police mindset that the social services will take the lead from the start. If the first response is, for want of a better word, ""a softer one"", there may be a perception among perpetrators that they can try to explain their actions away. As for victims, it is vital that they do not encounter responses that appear to decriminalise their experiences or, worse, attribute blame to them for precipitating the violence by the own behaviour. If they do encounter such dismissive attitudes, they are unlikely to report again."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00757,2022-04-05-T-017,757,Sylvia Lim,"On this note, I should mention the special vulnerability of persons with disabilities. There is evidence from other countries that women with disabilities disproportionately experienced domestic violence and sexual violence. Given that disabled persons may be less able to defend themselves, we must be mindful of our special duty of care towards them. It was mentioned in the White Paper that frontline officers currently already undergo sensitivity training. I wonder if there is any component or other training to equip officers to respond to victims of violence who are disabled."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00758,2022-04-05-T-017,758,Sylvia Lim,"I next move on to discuss cases of repeat violence. Repeat violence is not uncommon in family cases. Besides investigating cases after they have occurred, are the agencies looking into strategies to prevent the incidents in the first place? In particularly high-risk cases, how much resources are agencies willing to put in?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00759,2022-04-05-T-017,759,Sylvia Lim,"At first blush, it might sound impossible for external persons to prevent incidents that happen within the house. However, it has been done to some extent, and successfully, elsewhere."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00760,2022-04-05-T-017,760,Sylvia Lim,"To illustrate my point, I will take an example from the UK. In the 1990s, police in Merseyside innovated with a rapid response initiative to address cases of repeated violence identified as particularly high-risk."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00761,2022-04-05-T-017,761,Sylvia Lim,"As research had shown that a repeat incident was most likely to occur within days of the first incident, victims were issued with neck pendant alarms for a short period of time. When they sensed that a violent attack was imminent, they could activate the alarm so as to open a voice channel to law enforcement officers. The officers would then be able to hear what was going on in the home, talk to the victim if needed, and decide if a rapid response to the premises should be dispatched. This initiative was, indeed, resource-intensive, but it reaped significantly positive results for victims not only in reducing repeat incidents but in reducing fear of crime, immensely improving the quality of life for themselves and, often, their children, too."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00762,2022-04-05-T-017,762,Sylvia Lim,I cite this example to illustrate what a strong commitment to bringing down family violence might entail. Will our agencies be innovating their own preventive strategies in particularly serious cases?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00763,2022-04-05-T-017,763,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, I know that family violence is not an easy matter as it is often multifaceted and related to social factors, such as alcohol consumption, anger management issues and the like. Victims are usually in a difficult position as sending their spouses to jail often impacts the family economically and, in that sense, can be ""unaffordable"". This, in turn, may lead agencies to face ambivalence from victims who report for protection and then withdraw when it comes to prosecution."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00764,2022-04-05-T-017,764,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, before I leave this topic on family violence, I would like to comment on possible mindset issues to be overcomed within law enforcement itself. The need to strengthen societal attitudes against family violence applies to frontline officers, too. This is not a new issue; neither is it confined to Singapore alone."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00765,2022-04-05-T-017,765,Sylvia Lim,"Being a Police officer carries a certain, almost romanticised, notion of going after bad guys and girls. While there may be other motivations, there are many officers I know personally who enjoy the adrenaline rush of handling murder cases and going after organised crimes syndicates. Some officers may not find handling family violence cases quite their cup of tea. If they bring reluctance or disinterest to such cases, the public will feel it. It is thus important for the official HR policy for career progression not to relegate such duties as unimportant and thereby affect that officer's career prospects. Beyond official HR policy, there is also the issue of the unofficial culture, that is, what officers talk about in the canteens, which may be much harder to overcome."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00766,2022-04-05-T-017,766,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, next, I move on to workplace culture. We deserve gender-neutral workplaces. What does this mean in practice? Hiring and promotion of employees on equal footing, male or female, are fundamental."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00767,2022-04-05-T-017,767,Sylvia Lim,"To this end, like Ms He Ting Ru, I welcome the pending anti-discrimination legislation and stronger fair employment guidelines as steps in the right direction."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00768,2022-04-05-T-017,768,Sylvia Lim,"There is a further aspect that is more insidious and, that is, again, culture. There was an example of this that made international headlines last year. Then-New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, faced allegations that he had sexually harassed female employees. In his defence, he said that he was unaware that his behaviour of touching female employees was offensive and attributed it to his Italian heritage."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00769,2022-04-05-T-017,769,Sylvia Lim,"Do we have similar challenges here, too? How many women bear with unwarranted contact from male superiors because they want to keep their jobs? A fleeting touch may seem harmless to some. However, it bears remembering that physical touching without consent could well amount to the offence of outrage of modesty."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00770,2022-04-05-T-017,770,Sylvia Lim,"What about something less than touching, such as making loaded comments? To cite a personal experience  decades ago, when I was a law enforcement officer, it was suggested to me by a male superior that I should put on make-up when I came to work. I did not take offence at that time, as I simply dismissed the comment as crazy since we were not running a modelling agency. But thinking back about it today, the comment was probably made innocently, but was it appropriate? Would such comments impact other women much more deeply?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00771,2022-04-05-T-017,771,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, we do not want to go to the extreme of resorting to litigation for such matters. But to avoid undue pressure on females in the workplace, employers and society as a whole would need to step up and educate themselves, too."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00772,2022-04-05-T-017,772,Sylvia Lim,"Finally, public policymaking. Sir, the White Paper recognises that female participation is necessary for standard setting. This is seen under the section on mindset shifts at Action 24  ""Develop gender-responsive standards under the Singapore Standardisation Programme"". There is express recognition that there is a need to improve gender diversity in the standards community so as to develop gender-responsive standards. Examples cited were minimising workplace accidents with health and safety standards and ensuring food in Singapore was safe for consumption."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00773,2022-04-05-T-017,773,Sylvia Lim,"It was stated that Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Standards Council will develop a new gender strategy in 2022. In order to track whether such initiatives are effective, I will make the general point on the need to continually collate and publish data on a gender-aggregated basis. This is essential for meaningful analysis in gender-sensitive policymaking."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00774,2022-04-05-T-017,774,Sylvia Lim,"Related to standard setting, there is mention in the White Paper of the importance of having more women in leadership roles as CEOs and directors of companies. That said, it is also vital to have more women in political leadership, which I consider to be standard setting at the national level. I was glad to hear Minister Josephine Teo earlier highlight the increased presence of women in this House and that society was better off for it. I had spoken on this topic in August last year on the Workers' Party's Motion on gender equality. I do not intend to repeat myself here, save to say that this is a critical peg that we all need to work on."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00775,2022-04-05-T-017,775,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, in summary, I have spoken on family violence and shared my observations on some areas that we should consider or at least be mindful of, especially regarding the response of law enforcement. I have also touched on workplace culture and the impact on the experiences of female employees. Finally, I had reiterated that standard setting in public policy also requires gender-aggregated data and significant women participation in political leadership."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00776,2022-04-05-T-017,776,Speaker,Mr Sharael Taha.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00777,2022-04-05-T-017,777,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last 60 years, much progress has been made in women's development in Singapore in many areas, such as education, healthcare, the enactment of the Women's Charter, protection from violence and more equal working opportunities. The White Paper on Singapore Women's Development is an important step to continue the progress and collectively drive the whole-of-nation commitment to advance Singapore women's development. And I believe that there is more that we can do to increase its effectiveness."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00778,2022-04-05-T-017,778,Sharael Taha,"Firstly, collectively as a society, we can do more to create a safer, fairer, more inclusive and progressive workplace through the introduction of workplace fairness and expediting the legislation for FWAs while providing assistance to caregivers and back-to-work mothers with re-employment opportunities"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00779,2022-04-05-T-017,779,Sharael Taha,"Secondly, while we work towards changing the entrenched stereotype that women are primary caregivers and, hence, often shoulder a heavier caregiving load in the family, we must provide better and easier support for our caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00780,2022-04-05-T-017,780,Sharael Taha,"Thirdly, to further ease the caregiving load, how can we continue to provide more affordable childcare?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00781,2022-04-05-T-017,781,Sharael Taha,The pandemic was a catalyst for organisations to adopt FWAs. FWAs have helped both men and women better manage their workplace and personal responsibilities.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00782,2022-04-05-T-017,782,Sharael Taha,"Due to restricted access to the workplace during the pandemic, it became a ""burning platform"" for workplace norms on FWAs to evolve. Now that the ""burning platform"" has less urgency, I worry that organisations will not devote enough time and attention to FWAs and revert to the old ways of working, something which my colleague, Mr Melvin Yong, mentioned in his speech earlier, too."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00783,2022-04-05-T-017,783,Sharael Taha,"Hence, while I understand that the introduction of the Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs will take place only in 2024, we should consider scheduling important milestones that would, eventually, lead up to it. This would go towards ensuring that we keep up the momentum towards making FWAs a norm."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00784,2022-04-05-T-017,784,Sharael Taha,"Since many primary caregivers tend to be women due to our entrenched societal expectation, to increase the effectiveness of FWA in furthering Singapore women's development, we must also do more to promote job restructuring through flexi-load or job-sharing. This can enable those with caregiving responsibilities to continue playing a part in the workforce."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00785,2022-04-05-T-017,785,Sharael Taha,"Take, for example, Mdm Farhana from Pasir Ris. She takes care of her elderly mother who undergoes dialysis three times a week. If more organisations adopt job-sharing, flexible work hours and remote working, caregivers like her may have more opportunities to contribute to the workforce."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00786,2022-04-05-T-017,786,Sharael Taha,"Women play many important roles in our society. They contribute to the economy and shoulder a heavier burden of caregiving. Hence, while we enable FWAs to help both men and women better manage their workplace and personal responsibilities, the FWAs must also address the dos and don'ts of how to protect their privacy and family time at home."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00787,2022-04-05-T-017,787,Sharael Taha,"As we practise more flexible work hours, workers will be working at different hours to manage their workplace and personal responsibilities. We have heard of anecdotal stories of workers feeling pressured whenever they receive or have to answer emails late at night. While we do not want to go to the extreme end, like in France, where it is illegal to email an employee after office hours, we must recognise that FWAs mean that different groups of people will be working at different times. However, as FWAs blur the line between work and home, how can we get employers and workers to come to a new understanding about work-life balance and respect for personal space and time?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00788,2022-04-05-T-017,788,Sharael Taha,"We should also encourage employers and organisations to facilitate the re-entry of women into the workforce. Whether through developing mentorship or internship programmes, or by providing networking or retraining opportunities, the effort to enable more women to re-enter the workforce should be recognised and highlighted as an important consideration for fair and inclusive employment practices."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00789,2022-04-05-T-017,789,Sharael Taha,"In a study conducted by PPIS on the aspirations of Muslim women in Singapore, one of the top aspirations of Muslim women is to be financially independent. However, many respondents shared that they felt less employable as they perceived that social inequality in employment opportunities still exist. They also felt there was less exposure to different job opportunities and, interestingly, they felt that there were insufficient avenues to upskill for better paying jobs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00790,2022-04-05-T-017,790,Sharael Taha,"How can we, as a society, come together to support and create platforms for our back-to-work mothers seeking upskilling and re-employment opportunities? PPIS President, Ms Hazlina Abdul Halim, also suggested that such programmes should be attended by spouses to provide the closest support for our back-to-work mothers, something which I do agree, that us, males, we must do more of."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00791,2022-04-05-T-017,791,Sharael Taha,"While we continue towards changing the mindset that women should be the primary caregivers, we must continue to improve the support for our caregivers. I acknowledge the Government's efforts to increase the supply of respite care with 3,100 homecare places and 4,600 daycare places for seniors added since 2015, one of which is in Pasir Ris. However, given that one in four Singaporeans will be above the age of 65 by 2030, will this be enough? What are our projected requirements and how can we have a whole-of-nation commitment to address the manpower needs of the respite care industry?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00792,2022-04-05-T-017,792,Sharael Taha,"Yet, another way we could extend help to reduce caregivers' financial strain is through the enhancement of the Home Caregiving Grant. I support the doubling of the Home Caregiving Grant from $200 to $400 for lower-income households. This is a significant enhancement to the grant which has already benefited 31,000 individuals. However, we must explore how to better create awareness for the grant or any other grants for caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00793,2022-04-05-T-017,793,Sharael Taha,"One of our Pasir Ris residents, Mdm Neo, who is in her 60s and currently unemployed, takes care of her bedridden husband. When I visited her a month ago, she happily shared that HDB has just installed the ramps and grab bars for her under the EASE programme. However, through our conversation, it became apparent that she has not heard about the Home Caregiving Grant."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00794,2022-04-05-T-017,794,Sharael Taha,How do we ensure caregivers are aware of the support that is available and not just ask for it when they truly are at their wits end?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00795,2022-04-05-T-017,795,Sharael Taha,"Do we have effective outreach programmes to help support our caregivers? Should we also segregate caregivers based on who they are caring for, for example, someone providing care for a person with disability, vis-a-vis a caregiver providing care to a chronically ill elderly? Both these caregivers need and deserve our support. Should we have a one-stop portal that can serve all caregivers or at least provide the relevant information for any one of our caregivers? How can we proactively engage our caregivers so that they do not feel that they are left to their own devices?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00796,2022-04-05-T-017,796,Sharael Taha,"Since our visit to Mdm Neo, I am happy that she is now applying for the Home Caregiving Grant and is our monthly beneficiary at our Pasir Ris Care Store."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00797,2022-04-05-T-017,797,Sharael Taha,"Another way to ease the caregiving load is to continue providing affordable and quality preschools. Besides subsidies for anchor or partner childcare operators, can the Ministry consider providing subsidies for private schools and private childcare options, such as those in religious organisations that are already available?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00798,2022-04-05-T-017,798,Sharael Taha,"I also urge the Government to review the differentiated childcare subsidy of $300 per month for working and $150 per month for non-working mothers. We must recognise that some women choose to remain at home instead of work, in order to provide adequate care for the young, or to persons with disabilities or developmental needs. There are also some women who had to quit their job because of health issues."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00799,2022-04-05-T-017,799,Sharael Taha,"For example, one of our mothers in Pasir Ris had to quit her job while she recovers from depression. However, the family was worried that with the differentiated childcare subsidy, by her not working, they will have to spend $300 more per month, in addition to her losing her income. We can do more to ease such pressures on our already stressed young mothers. Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00800,2022-04-05-T-017,800,Sharael Taha,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Over the last 60 years, much progress has been made in women's development in Singapore in many areas, such as education, healthcare, the enactment of the Women's Charter, protection from violence and more equal working opportunities. The White Paper on Singapore Women's Development is an important step to collectively drive the whole-of-nation commitment to advance Singapore Women's Development and I believe that there is still more that we can do to increase its effectiveness."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00801,2022-04-05-T-017,801,Sharael Taha,"Firstly, we can, collectively, do more to create workplaces that are safer, fairer, more inclusive and progressive by introducing fairness at the workplace and expediting the legislation for FWAs and providing assistance to caregivers and back-to-work women."

What roles can bodies, such as MENDAKI and NTUC, play to create platforms for back-to-work mothers who wish to seek upskilling and re-employment opportunities?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00804,2022-04-05-T-017,804,Sharael Taha,PPIS President Ms Hazlina Abdul Halim also suggested that married couples attend such programmes so that back-to-work women can receive support from the person closest to them – something that I really agree with.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00805,2022-04-05-T-017,805,Sharael Taha,"Second, while we work towards changing the stereotype that women are primary caregivers and, hence, often shoulder a heavier caregiving load in the family, we must provide better and easier support to our caregivers."

2022-04-05-T-017-S-00807,2022-04-05-T-017,807,Sharael Taha,"Finally, we should encourage more women to take on leadership roles as well as venture into the STEM fields. We should provide support for our young women to find jobs in the growing industries."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00808,2022-04-05-T-017,808,Sharael Taha,"(In English)  In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, ultimately, we all have a part to play to inculcate the values of fairness, equality and respect. We all can address gender roles from young, at home and in schools and, in this way, help to build a fairer and more inclusive society where all Singaporeans have full and equal opportunities to achieve their aspirations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00809,2022-04-05-T-017,809,Sharael Taha,"Women represent our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. Every one of us has a vested interest in ensuring a supportive and inclusive workplace, free from harassments and discrimination. Women deserve to feel safe and protected as they remain important contributors to society. We must role model equal and mutually supportive gender relationships built on sincere care and concern for others. This will help determine how women in the next generation will be treated as we commit to build a fairer and more inclusive society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00810,2022-04-05-T-017,810,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00811,2022-04-05-T-017,811,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In August of last year, I spoke in support of the Motion on Gender Equality tabled by my colleague Ms He Ting Ru. I highlighted the unequal distribution of care responsibilities between parents and how this is linked to discriminatory social institutions and stereotypes about gender roles. I suggested that the impetus for change lies with both the views held by the individual and society at large, as well as with us policymakers and how we shape those views."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00812,2022-04-05-T-017,812,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"My colleague, Mr Gerald Giam, will be touching on FWAs and how both employers and employees gain from having FWAs as the norm, rather than the exception at the workplace. As I have reiterated across various speeches over the last two years, I hope that the Government, businesses and society do not view FWAs as one which has unintended consequences of reduced employability or, ironically, creating rigidity in the workplace. And it is imperative for the Government to demonstrate leadership on this matter."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00813,2022-04-05-T-017,813,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The first issue I would like to touch on is that of parental leave and its impact on the roles of fathers in society and in accelerating gender equality. The upheaval caused by COVID-19 and its impact on how we work have shone a spotlight on gender inequality that exists at home, with working mothers often the ones who have to pick up the slack. I previously highlighted a study by market research firm IPSOS Group S.A. and United Women Singapore, which showed that a mere 47% of mothers are happy with the division of household and care responsibilities, as opposed to 78% of fathers – a clear difference in perception that we need to shift."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00814,2022-04-05-T-017,814,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"These shifts in societal perception that we seek do not happen in isolation. Policies play a large part in shaping these views and, on this front, I was a bit disappointed to see that the White Paper has fallen short on concrete policy changes to encourage fathers to take on a more active role in household and caregiving responsibilities, especially around a more equitable distribution of statutory parental leave."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00815,2022-04-05-T-017,815,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the immediate aftermath of a child's birth represent a golden opportunity of sorts to shape lasting good habits among young fathers that persist throughout a child's lifetime. Fathers who spend more time with their infant children develop greater confidence in their own childcare abilities, perpetuating a virtuous cycle that leads to lasting egalitarian split of responsibilities between mothers and fathers. There is also a suggestion that women in more equitable households can focus more energies on career development, leading to better gender equality both at home and at work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00816,2022-04-05-T-017,816,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The impact is not limited to the parents involved, but also has far-reaching impacts on society at large. A study by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics in Germany from 2017 showed that in the decade after Germany introduced reforms in 2006, to encourage fathers to take at least two months of parental leave, there was a marked shift in the attitudes of not just the current generation of parents towards gender equality, but also the grandparents' generation. Both grandmothers and grandfathers, whose grandchildren were born after the reforms, were less likely to agree with the sentiment that ""[w]omen should be more concerned about their family than about their career""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00817,2022-04-05-T-017,817,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Since my last speech on this topic, some of you would know that I have welcomed a new addition to the family and our little baby boy is now just over four months old. I am extremely grateful that my employer is understanding and a strong believer in FWAs, but many other young fathers do not share the same experience. A mere two weeks of paid statutory paternity leave, compared to the OECD average of 10 weeks, means that even the most well-meaning of fathers who wish to take on a more egalitarian share of the child-rearing responsibility must make direct financial trade-offs, such as via unpaid leave. By increasing the statutory entitlement to fully-paid parental leave for fathers, we can, at the very least, eliminate some of the direct financial considerations from the mental calculus."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00818,2022-04-05-T-017,818,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"We are heartened by the Government's move to lead by example in encouraging public officers to utilise their full entitlement of parental leave. This will go some way towards breaking down stereotypes and misconceptions in the workplace that lead to lower take-up rates. But we can, definitely, go a step further with actual policy changes. The existing elective four weeks of shared parental leave, whereby mothers have to make the election to share their maternity leave, means that, in practice, it is rarely transferred, with 94% to 97% of fathers not taking at least one day of shared parental leave for the 2014 to 2018 cohorts."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00819,2022-04-05-T-017,819,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"And I can imagine the challenges mothers face in reducing their paid maternity leave, especially when we consider that our parental leave policies are not exactly world leading, with the 16 weeks of maternity leave below the OECD average of 20 weeks. The experience of other countries, such as Sweden or Germany, has shown that the introduction of mandatory use-it-or-lose-it ""daddy days"" significantly increased the take-up rate of paternity leave. A further expansion can come in the form of ""sharing bonuses"" awarded if fathers take up their full minimum entitlement of shared parental leave."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00820,2022-04-05-T-017,820,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Portugal has experimented with this model, which increased the take-up rate of shared paternity leave from 596 fathers in 2009 before the reforms, to about 16,400 fathers the year after."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00821,2022-04-05-T-017,821,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"This is why the Workers' Party has, in our manifesto, called for a shared parental leave scheme that entitles parents to 24 weeks of Government-paid leave, to be shared between mothers and fathers as they choose, but, crucially, with a minimum of four weeks to be granted to the father and 12 weeks to the mother. This would replace the existing 16-week maternity and two-week paternity leave entitlements  an increase from 18 weeks to 24 weeks in total of gender-neutral parental leave."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00822,2022-04-05-T-017,822,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Further, as an added incentive, consideration could be given for an additional bonus number of weeks to be awarded to the pool if fathers utilise the full four weeks of minimum parental leave they are entitled to. The hope is that, over time, these increased entitlements become entrenched as social norms – as has happened in countries like Germany – as more parents utilise their full entitlement, initially to benefit from the bonuses, and, over time, because it is simply the thing to do. These new social norms will encourage fathers to spend more time with their children and take on a greater role in the child's development, take on their fair share of household chores and lead to an overall uplift in our society's perception of gender roles."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00823,2022-04-05-T-017,823,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The second issue I would like to touch on is that of providing support to parents and, especially, mothers beyond childbirth. We all recognise the importance of parental care leave in allowing mothers to properly recover from giving birth to her baby and for parents to care for and bond with their newborn child. However, while we have a high standard of medical care provided at childbirth across all our hospitals here in Singapore, I believe more can be done to provide greater postpartum support to mothers, especially to first-time mothers, and families who may not have the economic resources to obtain post-birth support services."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00824,2022-04-05-T-017,824,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"To many parents, including my wife and I, having a trusted confinement nanny to support our transition from a clueless couple to proud parents is a godsend. Such services do not come cheap, however, as they range in the thousands of dollars, and made worse in the last two years due to the border closures. Yet, even for those of us who are lucky enough to have the dedicated care and support of a live-in confinement nanny, the immediate aftermath of a confinement nanny's departure is still one characterised by high levels of stress and anxiety."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00825,2022-04-05-T-017,825,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"They say it takes a village to raise a child and I find it to be especially true after the birth of my second son. One might think that, as experienced parents, things will get easier and we might enjoy some efficiency gains. But my personal experience suggests that caring for two young children is more than double the amount of effort. We are extremely thankful for the village that was our families and extended families. However, not everyone has easy access to their very own village and, for many others, the parenthood journey can also be a lonely and alienating one."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00826,2022-04-05-T-017,826,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Beyond providing informational support, could we bring the proverbial village to all mothers out there, to ensure that community support and services are available, especially to those without a strong informal support system, to fill the care gap? My colleague, Ms He Ting Ru, spoke about this point earlier as well, with her suggestion being instituting practices, such as having specially-trained health visitors, to routinely call on our new mothers. To reduce inequity and inequality during the foundational years of our children's lives, we need to strengthen access to continuous care for the health and well-being of our parents."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00827,2022-04-05-T-017,827,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I have spoken about support for parents in the plural and I would now like to switch gears slightly and focus on the topic of support for single-parent households. I am heartened to see that one of the action plans, Action 18, introduced in the White Paper seeks to ""enhance support for single parents"" and I look forward to the concrete initiatives and recommendations to come."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00828,2022-04-05-T-017,828,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"There is merit to the ground-up consultative approach adopted by AfA, but, in parallel, more can already be done to correct systematic discrimination faced by single parents under the law. One of these areas is the differential treatment currently accorded to unmarried single parents – often single mothers – in contrast to their peers who are single parents by virtue of divorce or who are widowed. This contrast shows up most starkly on the issue of housing access – with far-reaching consequences for both parent and child. After all, a stable home environment is one of the leading indicators of positive developmental outcomes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00829,2022-04-05-T-017,829,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"At present, HDB recognises single-parent households of divorced or widowed parents as a family nucleus, for the purposes of public housing eligibility, as well as for access to public housing grants. Some concessions have been made, depending on individual case circumstances, such as permitting unmarried single parents aged 21 and above to buy up to a 3-room flat in a non-mature estate from HDB, or a resale flat; but they still do not receive equal treatment to their divorced or widowed counterparts, let alone other families."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00830,2022-04-05-T-017,830,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Outside of these concessions, unmarried single-parent households have to avail of the schemes targeted at singles. The eligibility schemes and grants targeted at singles are often more restrictive and have lower monetary amounts. Yet, the challenges that single parents face do not discriminate based on marital status and are, in fact, more pronounced, especially when we consider that single parents have to singlehandedly shoulder the burden of both being the primary caregiver and primary breadwinner."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00831,2022-04-05-T-017,831,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"This struggle was experienced first-hand by one of my constituents who is an unmarried single mother with her daughter. She shared the challenges she has faced over the years and how she has fought to overcome them to do right by her child. In addition to battling social stigmas and stereotypes, she was discouraged by the various Government policies, such as that for housing. As a young father, I understand the trials and joys of parenthood, but I cannot begin to imagine the sheer weight of responsibility faced by single parents, such as herself."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00832,2022-04-05-T-017,832,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The challenges faced by unmarried single parents are large enough without the additional burden of being viewed differently in the eyes of the Government for access to public housing. The consequences of the distinction are self-evident. Financial worries are not uncommon for single-parent households and every cent counts. The median monthly employment income for unmarried single mothers below the age of 35 was $600 in 2017, a number which has hardly changed since 2013."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00833,2022-04-05-T-017,833,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The $10,000 to $15,000 difference between the Proximity Housing Grant for Families and Singles could amount to a year of mortgage payments or a significant contribution to a child's college fund. Families also qualify for the family grant, which can rise to $50,000, double the $25,000 maximum awarded to singles."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00834,2022-04-05-T-017,834,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"While HDB is free to assess cases individually and make exceptions if appropriate, it does not appear that the exception is commonly made. In response to my Parliamentary Question in a previous Sitting on the number of unmarried single parents who have successfully obtained the Proximity Housing Grant for families in the last five years, MND Minister Desmond Lee shared that only five unmarried single-parent families had obtained the grant, in contrast to 2,029 divorced or widowed single-parent families."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00835,2022-04-05-T-017,835,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"This is but one example of differential treatment under the law for unmarried single-parent households. Elsewhere, single parents are not eligible for the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Cash Gift Baby Bonus Plus, which amount to $8,000 in total. The Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother Child Relief (WMCR) are also not extended to single parents. If the WMCR is to encourage married mothers to continue working after childbirth, the reality for many single mothers out there is that they simply cannot afford to not continue working after childbirth."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00836,2022-04-05-T-017,836,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"No matter the express objectives of our Marriage and Parenthood policies to promote and strengthen the institution of family, and to encourage parenthood within marriage, children are not insulated from the impact of our policymaking. It is also these policies which could inevitably contribute to inequality at birth and beyond."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00837,2022-04-05-T-017,837,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Lastly, I would like to raise my concerns on women's retirement adequacy and financial literacy. Having adequate financial literacy to support sound financial decision-making throughout one's lifetime and having sufficient savings to support one's retirement are issues not unique to women. However, based on CPF data, as of 31 December 2020, we see that CPF members' balances for men are 10% higher than those for women, even though the number of men and women CPF members are roughly equivalent."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00838,2022-04-05-T-017,838,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"While women had higher average CPF balances as compared to men up to the age of 35, this could perhaps be explained by the roughly two years of National Service commitments or that women in these age groups are, generally, paid more favourably compared to men. Men across all other age groups had between 6% and 35% higher average CPF balances, compared to women within the same age groups."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00839,2022-04-05-T-017,839,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The gender gap in retirement adequacy, especially when we have a defined contribution type pension system linked to employment, is one which needs to be squarely addressed. It is thus imperative that we redouble our efforts to strengthen social safety nets with an emphasis on adequate retirement adequacy for women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00840,2022-04-05-T-017,840,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"On financial literacy, the OCBC Financial Wellness Index 2020 report found that only 60% of women surveyed had investments, compared to 75% of men, noting that more Singapore women than men see investing as gambling. But for women with the confidence and knowledge to conduct their own investments, their investments do better than men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00841,2022-04-05-T-017,841,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"This perceived lack of knowledge or confidence is also reflected in an earlier survey conducted in 2019 by UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. While 64% of women believe they would outlive their spouses, with most women heavily involved in household daily expenses, a dominant 72% let their spouses take the lead on long-term investment and financial planning decisions."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00842,2022-04-05-T-017,842,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"While the White Paper compared literacy rates for women between 1965 and 2021, given our social security system which emphasises on individual responsibility and self-reliance, I hope the Government will commission an in-depth study to examine the levels of financial literacy amongst Singaporeans, with a particular emphasis on empowering women to take charge of their own financial well-being. Allowing all Singaporeans access to a simple and fuss-free investment solution to earn higher expected returns for their CPF as envisioned by the CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme will also go a long way to enhance retirement adequacy for all, which, I believe, will also significantly benefit women who are less inclined to invest on their own volition today."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00843,2022-04-05-T-017,843,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"To conclude, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the four issues I have raised – parental leave, providing support to parents beyond childbirth, supporting single-parent households and raising women's retirement adequacy and financial literacy – are not entirely new. But critically, what we need is a new approach which recognises that policies shape behaviour. And as lawmakers, we need to set in place concrete policy changes which reflect our collective will to advance women's development in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00844,2022-04-05-T-017,844,Deputy Speaker,Mr Vikram Nair.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00845,2022-04-05-T-017,845,Vikram Nair,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the journey for equal rights for women has been a long one. Around 200 years ago, the first organised women’s movement started in the UK. They were called the suffragettes, fighting for suffrage or the right to vote. It was only in the last century that women obtained the right to vote in most countries."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00846,2022-04-05-T-017,846,Vikram Nair,Singapore moved quickly – we passed the Women’s Charter in 1964 and the aim of this legislation was to give women equal rights in marriage and at work. This ended longstanding practices like polygamy. Women were also required to attend school and encouraged to join the workforce and did well in both areas. Women have enjoyed equal rights at law for a long time.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00847,2022-04-05-T-017,847,Vikram Nair,"However, equality at law was the start of the journey. Equal rights, in substance, are a longer journey and this White Paper facilitates that journey with concrete actions. The 25 action plans are comprehensive and touch on many of the issues women face today."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00848,2022-04-05-T-017,848,Vikram Nair,"While there are many initiatives I find interesting, I will focus on two broad areas in this speech, namely  (a) equal opportunities in the workplace; and (b) the recognition and support for caregivers. In simple terms, these initiatives strive towards substantive equality at work and at home."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00849,2022-04-05-T-017,849,Vikram Nair,"Under Area 1, Actions 1 and 2 provide an important development in Singapore’s employment law. I had spoken in favour of anti-discrimination legislation in earlier debates. This is relevant to many contexts, including protecting against discrimination based on gender, race, religion and, back then, it was nationality. In the absence of legislation, MOM had given effect to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices by linking companies’ rights to tap foreign workers to compliance with these guidelines. So, Singaporeans had to be given fair consideration before you could employ foreign workers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00850,2022-04-05-T-017,850,Vikram Nair,"If these guidelines are now legislated, then it will apply more broadly to all employers, even those who do not employ foreign workers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00851,2022-04-05-T-017,851,Vikram Nair,Grievance handling procedures and protection of complainants will also be required. I expect this will require a cultural shift amongst employers in Singapore.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00852,2022-04-05-T-017,852,Vikram Nair,"For a long time, we had a strict contractual interpretation of employment rights and it was easy for employers to both hire and fire. Now, employers will need to make hiring and promotion decisions more carefully and, in practical terms, will likely need to properly document decisions to prevent allegations of unfairness."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00853,2022-04-05-T-017,853,Vikram Nair,"There is also legislation envisioned in relation to FWAs and new tripartite guidelines that envision requiring employers to fairly consider requests for FWAs. Many employers had to radically rethink their work arrangements over the last two years with the work-from-home requirements. Hopefully, the lessons learnt from this experience will not be lost but will, instead, be utilised when we return to business as normal."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00854,2022-04-05-T-017,854,Vikram Nair,"Of course, flexible work is a lot more than just working from home. It includes the option to work shorter hours or fewer days in a week, which will require employers to put in more thought in the work scope of individual employees."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00855,2022-04-05-T-017,855,Vikram Nair,"Again, though, these FWAs should be equally available to men and women to be effective. This is so that, for example, in certain households, if men wish to play a bigger role in caregiving, they may also need to avail themselves of FWAs to play this role. Otherwise, if FWAs apply only to women, it may have the perverse effect of forcing women to continue to bear the caregiving load using these arrangements."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00856,2022-04-05-T-017,856,Vikram Nair,"Finally, on this front, I also welcome the initiative to promote greater board diversity. This is being done through changes in the listing rules and the Code of Corporate Governance. Again, I note that diversity is not intended to cover gender alone, but also other forms of diversity, which I assume would also include race and professional backgrounds of members of the Board. As Boards provide leadership to companies, having diverse boards would provide companies with a greater breadth of perspective as well as having a positive knock-on effect within the ranks of companies, as diverse boards are more likely to pick from a wider pool of talent for leadership and executive positions in the company as well."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00857,2022-04-05-T-017,857,Vikram Nair,"These legislative changes detract somewhat from the ""freedom to contract"" model we have adopted in relation to employment law, but I believe that these are necessary derogations as these initiatives protect employees in vulnerable positions. The combination of more FWAs as well as fair consideration principles being legislated could go a long way to allow men and women the ability to remain in the workforce and not be embarrassed or discriminated against if they decide to take different work arrangements to attend to caregiving needs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00858,2022-04-05-T-017,858,Vikram Nair,"When we move from the workplace to the home, we also find that women often bear the bulk of caregiving responsibilities. The second set of actions, 7 to 11, provide a wide-ranging suite of measures to lighten the caregivers' load. Action 7 provides direct respite for caregivers by adding basic child- and elder-minding services to the Household Services Scheme. The financial strain will be eased with grants, such as the Home Caregiving Grant and the expanded Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund, with further future support envisioned. Access to affordable preschools is going to be enhanced and there is also a focus on the mental and physical health of caregivers, with support networks being set up."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00859,2022-04-05-T-017,859,Vikram Nair,"These options are important because they, significantly, ease the load many women carry at home. Again, as with FWAs, I would suggest that all these grants and support be provided on a gender-neutral basis, so that if the caregiver at home is the man, these grants and support should be equally accessible to them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00860,2022-04-05-T-017,860,Vikram Nair,"In addition, I would suggest that it may help to have support networks that are specific to male caregivers as they may face a different stigma from female caregivers. A newspaper feature on stay-at-home fathers who did the caregiving while their wives were the primary breadwinners highlighted the stigma that many of them face. Yet, these are the best examples of men supporting their wives with their aspirations and should be celebrated. If this gets more normalised, this may have a much stronger impact on the overall journey to gender equality. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to say some words in Tamil."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00861,2022-04-05-T-017,861,Vikram Nair,"(In Tamil)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Last year, I discussed in this House the experiences shared with me in one of the dialogues on Women's Development that I attended with Ms Indranee Rajah with women from the Indian community. Many of the issues raised now see benefits through direct action plans."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00862,2022-04-05-T-017,862,Vikram Nair,"One big development is enshrining the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices into law. This will mean that opportunities will need to be given to people on merit, and irrelevant considerations, such as gender, should not be taken into account. Measures are also in place to protect those who speak out."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00863,2022-04-05-T-017,863,Vikram Nair,"Women are often caregivers in many households, for both the young and the elderly. This paper proposes broadening the Household Services Scheme to include basic child- and elder-minding services, to give families more options."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00864,2022-04-05-T-017,864,Vikram Nair,"Financial support will be given to caregivers for the elderly with different grants, and access to affordable preschools will be enhanced. Additional support is also being rolled out for those caring for persons with disabilities and children with developmental needs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00865,2022-04-05-T-017,865,Vikram Nair,"The above are just a few examples of changes in this wide-ranging paper that aims to create a more equal society for women, both at home and at work and support the important role they play in both areas."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00866,2022-04-05-T-017,866,Vikram Nair,"(In English)  Deputy Speaker, I support this Motion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00867,2022-04-05-T-017,867,Deputy Speaker,Minister of State Gan Siow Huang.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00868,2022-04-05-T-017,868,Gan Siow Huang,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, women hold many important roles in our society. We are colleagues at the workplace, also mothers, wives, sisters and daughters to our families, Therefore, as we debate in this House about how we can better support women, we are, indeed, debating about how we can create a better future, not for Singapore women alone, but for Singaporeans."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00869,2022-04-05-T-017,869,Gan Siow Huang,"We have made good progress in empowering women in Singapore and we should be proud of that. Today, women make up almost half of the labour force, literally holding up half the sky."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00870,2022-04-05-T-017,870,Gan Siow Huang,"The employment rate for women aged 25 to 64 has continually grown over the past two decades and, remarkably, continued to increase even during the pandemic from 73.2% in 2020 to 75.1% in 2021 – beating the odds."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00871,2022-04-05-T-017,871,Gan Siow Huang,"Many more women are entering and excelling in what are traditionally regarded as male-dominated sectors, such as STEM, construction, professional services and becoming leaders in their chosen fields, many of whom are in the Chamber today. We will continue to encourage and support women in pursuing their career ambitions while respecting women's choices on the sectors that they wish to contribute to."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00872,2022-04-05-T-017,872,Gan Siow Huang,"Given our manpower constraints, it is crucial that we enable both women and men to be part of our workforce as much as possible."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00873,2022-04-05-T-017,873,Gan Siow Huang,"I share the story of a dear colleague of mine. She lives with her retired husband and mother-in-law who has dementia and is bedridden. Although they have a helper, her husband started to face burnout a few years ago. In her previous job, she felt extremely helpless as she was working long hours and was unable to work from home. She contemplated early retirement to better care for her family."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00874,2022-04-05-T-017,874,Gan Siow Huang,"Thankfully, after changing jobs, things improved for her as she is now able to work from home regularly and is given time off to run errands when needed. She appreciates the workplace flexibility that allows her to continue working and be financially independent. With a more balanced share of caregiving load in her family, everyone enjoys better physical and mental well-being."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00875,2022-04-05-T-017,875,Gan Siow Huang,"Experiences like this show how important FWAs can be. With workplace flexibilities, women who are caregivers will be better empowered with the choice to continue working and progressing in their careers, thereby reducing career lags for women and helps to close the gender pay gap."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00876,2022-04-05-T-017,876,Gan Siow Huang,"FWAs apply not just to women, but also to men. With greater workplace flexibility, coupled with a supportive workplace culture that recognises both men and women have a role to play in caregiving, more of us will be able to manage work and family demands. This is why we must press on with efforts to sustain workplace flexibilities."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00877,2022-04-05-T-017,877,Gan Siow Huang,"In 2020, close to nine in 10 employees worked in companies that provided at least one FWA on a sustained basis, up from more than six in 10 in 2015."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00878,2022-04-05-T-017,878,Gan Siow Huang,"As safe management measures gradually eased, we may be tempted to revert to pre-pandemic ways of working. However, if we do so, we will lose the many benefits that FWAs bring to employers and employees."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00879,2022-04-05-T-017,879,Gan Siow Huang,The White Paper has laid out our plans to strengthen and sustain FWAs at the workplace. We will introduce a new set of tripartite guidelines on FWAs by 2024.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00880,2022-04-05-T-017,880,Gan Siow Huang,"The tripartite guidelines will prescribe fair and proper practices that employers should adopt, such as having a proper process to assess employees' requests for FWAs and communicate the outcome of such requests. This will establish the norm that it is acceptable to request for FWAs while maintaining employers' prerogative to approve or reject the requests based on their business and operational needs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00881,2022-04-05-T-017,881,Gan Siow Huang,"To Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Melvin Yong's suggestion to implement the tripartite guidelines on FWAs earlier, it is important that we take a calibrated and enabling approach to enhance access to FWAs. We need to equip employers with capabilities to manage a more flexible workplace – not just remote work but also flexi-time and a flexi-work load – and also ensure that employees also understand the roles that they play in making FWAs sustainable for business operations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00882,2022-04-05-T-017,882,Gan Siow Huang,"We should build confidence and capacity instead of seeking to use legislation for every workplace issue that arises. Otherwise, workplace disputes will arise and the mutual trust and understanding between employers and employees which we have carefully maintained over the years will be eroded."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00883,2022-04-05-T-017,883,Gan Siow Huang,"Over 10,000 companies have already adopted the tripartite standard on FWAs, covering more than one in four employees in Singapore today. We welcome more companies that are ready to come on board even before the tripartite guidelines are introduced by 2024."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00884,2022-04-05-T-017,884,Gan Siow Huang,"As an intermediate milestone, MOM and our tripartite partners aim to increase the adoption of this voluntary tripartite standard on FWAs by companies covering 27% of employees today to 40% at the end of this year. The Public Service has adopted the tripartite standard on FWAs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00885,2022-04-05-T-017,885,Gan Siow Huang,"The Government also encourages and recognises companies with progressive HR policies, including FWAs, enhanced leave schemes for caregiving and sabbaticals, employee leave schemes, many of which were raised by Ms Poh Li San, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Louis Chua. I think these are all positive steps and we encourage companies to do so if it suits their employees' needs and their business operations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00886,2022-04-05-T-017,886,Gan Siow Huang,"The Alliance for Action for Work-Life Harmony has been championing these forms of work-life support since last year. Ultimately, companies with progressive policies will be able to better attract and retain talent, which is good for business."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00887,2022-04-05-T-017,887,Gan Siow Huang,"From the Conversations series on Singapore Women's Development, we also heard stories of how some women who chose to leave the workforce for a few years due to family reasons faced difficulties returning to work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00888,2022-04-05-T-017,888,Gan Siow Huang,"All employers ought to practise fair and merit-based hiring. If employers screen out applicants because of so-called resume gaps or last-drawn salary, they risk losing out on good candidates. A better, smarter approach is to make a robust and fair assessment of each candidate."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00889,2022-04-05-T-017,889,Gan Siow Huang,MOM will continue to partner the Institute for HR Professionals (IHRP) to uplift HR standards. We will help HR professionals develop capabilities that allow them to better tap on back-to-work women as a talent pool.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00890,2022-04-05-T-017,890,Gan Siow Huang,"For back-to-work women who are ready to return to the workforce, they can tap on Workforce Singapore's (WSG) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute's (e2i) career coaching and job matching services. They can also benefit from Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) to reskill for new jobs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00891,2022-04-05-T-017,891,Gan Siow Huang,"WSG will broaden its partnerships with various organisations, such as Mums@Work Singapore, Daughters Of Tomorrow and MENDAKI, to reach out to back-to-work women and support their journey to re-enter the workforce."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00892,2022-04-05-T-017,892,Gan Siow Huang,"I am heartened that there are organisations out there, such as NTUC Women and Family Unit, SHE BRILLIANCE and Financial Women's Association, that have been active in providing mentorship and career guidance to moms who are trying to come back to work. I think we need more of such community support to help uplift women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00893,2022-04-05-T-017,893,Gan Siow Huang,"Ms He Ting Ru spoke about the gender wage gap. I agree with her. We need to do more to reduce the gender wage gap. We need to take a multi-pronged practical approach towards this. We have heard of some countries that have legislated equal pay for equal work, such as in some parts of the US and Canada, but the adjusted pay gap remains higher than that in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00894,2022-04-05-T-017,894,Gan Siow Huang,"In Singapore, we take a much more practical approach towards matters like this. Here, we are talking about strengthening workplace fairness, introducing and entrenching FWAs, working with industry partners and community partners and using education to encourage and empower women to take on jobs in growth as well as in STEM sectors. After all, the main reason for the gender wage gap in Singapore is occupational segregation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00895,2022-04-05-T-017,895,Gan Siow Huang,"Financial literacy is important for financial well-being. I agree with Mr Louis Chua and I thank him for raising this point. Some women, because they are caregivers, may have had disrupted careers and, as a result, were not able to earn as much as their partners. Aside from providing a supportive environment for caregivers to continue working, MOM has also taken steps to help caregivers build their retirement nest egg."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00896,2022-04-05-T-017,896,Gan Siow Huang,"First, we encourage cash top-ups to CPF accounts of caregivers through tax incentives and Government matching grants for eligible seniors, many of whom have been women who benefited from these schemes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00897,2022-04-05-T-017,897,Gan Siow Huang,"Second, they can consider monetising their homes under the HDB Lease Buyback Scheme and the Silver Housing Bonus to unlock their housing value and enhance their retirement income."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00898,2022-04-05-T-017,898,Gan Siow Huang,"Third, we supplement the retirement income of seniors who had low incomes during their working years and now have less in retirement through the Silver Support Scheme. Lower-wage caregivers who are working may also be eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme, which provides up to $4,000 in cash and CPF top-ups annually today. From 2023 onwards, they can receive up to $4,200 in cash and CPF top-ups annually."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00899,2022-04-05-T-017,899,Gan Siow Huang,"For more women to succeed in their careers, we must also tackle discrimination and harassment at the workplace."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00900,2022-04-05-T-017,900,Gan Siow Huang,"Some participants in the conversations shared that women still face prejudice due to perceptions that they would be less committed at work due to caregiving and pregnancy reasons. When instances of discrimination or harassment were reported to their employers, some felt that their concerns were swept under the rug. Others hesitated to come forward because they were afraid to lose their jobs or of ""getting marked"" by their colleagues."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00901,2022-04-05-T-017,901,Gan Siow Huang,"We can do better. All of us have a role to play. We want to send a strong message of assurance that help is available and that those who seek help and recourse can do so safely and will be protected against retaliation. We do not tolerate workplace discrimination in any form, certainly not against women, be it for their caregiving responsibilities or their pregnancy status."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00902,2022-04-05-T-017,902,Gan Siow Huang,"This is why MOM and our tripartite partners are taking a significant step to enshrine the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in law, strengthening equal opportunities in the workplace."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00903,2022-04-05-T-017,903,Gan Siow Huang,"I must say this is really a long journey. Looking as far as back as 2016 in Parliament, Mr Patrick Tay had already been pushing for anti-workplace discrimination legislation. Over the years, numerous times, various Members of Parliament in this House have raised this. I am really glad that, finally, we are taking that big step towards legislation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00904,2022-04-05-T-017,904,Gan Siow Huang,The work of the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness is ongoing and the committee has agreed to look at protecting the confidentiality of the identity of those who report on discrimination or harassment at the workplace and protecting them against retaliation. The committee is looking also at the legislation to include requiring employers to have a proper process to handle grievances reported by their employees.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00905,2022-04-05-T-017,905,Gan Siow Huang,"Like many of the shifts in the White Paper, the eventual workplace fairness legislation will not just benefit women. In giving greater assurance to women at work, we are also giving greater assurance to all workers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00906,2022-04-05-T-017,906,Gan Siow Huang,"However, we all know that legislation is not a panacea. We need mindset shifts and collective action for real and sustained impact."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00907,2022-04-05-T-017,907,Gan Siow Huang,"I thank Ms Sylvia Lim for agreeing with us that the education of employers is key. As Ms Yeo Wan Ling highlighted, employers must educate and equip themselves, their supervisors and HR professionals to create fair, respectful and safe working environments."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00908,2022-04-05-T-017,908,Gan Siow Huang,"The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and the tripartite partners can help employers with this, with further support available for SMEs if they lack knowledge or the capacity in implementing proper policies and grievance handling processes. I urge companies to take ownership and tap on such help."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00909,2022-04-05-T-017,909,Gan Siow Huang,"To individuals who encounter workplace harassment, TAFEP's Workplace Harassment Resource and Recourse Centre is here to provide advice and assistance. We assure you that you are not alone and it is safe for you to reach out. Let us help and support you."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00910,2022-04-05-T-017,910,Gan Siow Huang,"Our community partners, such as grassroots leaders, union leaders, Daughters Of Tomorrow, Mums@Work Singapore, SCWO, AWARE and more, are among those working with us to augment outreach and support to those affected by workplace harassment. Together, we are enlarging the safety net to protect and support women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00911,2022-04-05-T-017,911,Gan Siow Huang,"As colleagues or friends, each one of us can make a difference, too. Do not be bystanders. Instead, call out and stand up against unfair and unsafe work practices and support those who are affected. We should work towards a vision of zero workplace discrimination and harassment. Before I conclude, let me highlight our key actions in Mandarin."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00912,2022-04-05-T-017,912,Gan Siow Huang,(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] We have listened to our people and charted out within the White Paper the direction and steps we will take to better support our Singapore women at the workplace.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00913,2022-04-05-T-017,913,Gan Siow Huang,We will enshrine TGFEP in law to strengthen and uphold principles of fairness at work so that our women will have equal opportunities alongside their male counterparts to pursue and progress in the careers of their choice.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00914,2022-04-05-T-017,914,Gan Siow Huang,"We will enhance our systems so that our work environments are safe and free from harassment. Employers will be required to put in place proper grievance handling procedures, protect the confidentiality of those who come forward to report workplace discrimination or harassment and protect them from retaliation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00915,2022-04-05-T-017,915,Gan Siow Huang,We will introduce Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements around 2024 to require employers to fairly and properly consider FWA requests and continue to boost the adoption of the Tripartite Standard to cover 40% of employees. We want to provide women and men with the necessary flexibilities at work so that they can pursue their personal or family aspirations while having a good career.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00916,2022-04-05-T-017,916,Gan Siow Huang,"(In English)  The benefits of our efforts will well extend beyond the workplace, where our children can grow up in more supportive family environments with greater parental involvement, where there will be stronger relationships between parents who share responsibilities at home, and where women and men partner each other as equals, progress together and pursue their aspirations freely and to the fullest."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00917,2022-04-05-T-017,917,Gan Siow Huang,"I am heartened to hear this joint call and commitment to action being strongly echoed by Members of Parliament who have spoken thus far. So, today, let us join hands as a society, regardless of our political affiliation, to commit to making our workplaces fairer and more inclusive, for an even stronger Singapore tomorrow. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00918,2022-04-05-T-017,918,Deputy Speaker,Dr Shahira Abdullah.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00919,2022-04-05-T-017,919,Shahira Abdullah,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to express my support for the action plans proposed in the White Paper on Singapore Women's Development. In my opinion, the policy and legislative changes that will be implemented have the ability to catalyse a mindset change in the whole community on how gender roles are perceived in today's context."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00920,2022-04-05-T-017,920,Shahira Abdullah,"I would like to focus my speech on the support for women in the workforce. To do so, we can, firstly, look at the gender pay gap. Both the adjusted and unadjusted measures of gender pay gap are used for policy-making."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00921,2022-04-05-T-017,921,Shahira Abdullah,"Based on a study conducted by MOM and NUS in 2020, it was found that there was an adjusted gender pay gap of 4.3%, which has shown a marked improvement, though it can still be improved. The gender pay gap was attributed to various factors. Women frequently play the primary role of a caregiver, be it to their children, the elderly as well as those with special needs. This may have impacted their time and experience at work, leading to delays in career progression and earnings."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00922,2022-04-05-T-017,922,Shahira Abdullah,"However, there was barely any change in the unadjusted gender pay gap between 2002 and 2018, with a differential of 16% between the two genders. This is significant and can be explained by occupational segregation. Examples include the effect of occupational choices which may be dictated by a woman's multiple responsibilities."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00923,2022-04-05-T-017,923,Shahira Abdullah,"The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) in 2020 also shows further evidence of the motherhood penalty in which the gap widens, particularly when women reach their peak childbearing or childcaring ages."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00924,2022-04-05-T-017,924,Shahira Abdullah,"So, what can be done to narrow this gap? I am very heartened that the White Paper has taken a multi-pronged approach to tackle this."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00925,2022-04-05-T-017,925,Shahira Abdullah,"Firstly, gender discrimination and implicit biases still persist in the workplace, intended or unintended. For example, minority women may have to deal with biases due to gender as well as race. In June 2021, a woman applying for a preschool teacher job was allegedly asked to remove her hijab at work. Additionally, whether a woman decides to get married or start a family should not be asked in interviews or play a part in whether job opportunities are offered. It is disheartening that we are now in the 21st century and yet women are still having to contend with questions on their childbearing motivations at the workplace and upon being hired. Therefore, it is very welcomed that we will be enshrining the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in law. Doing so will afford better protection to women who are victims of discrimination and prevent retaliation against those who whistle-blow."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00926,2022-04-05-T-017,926,Shahira Abdullah,"In particular, I would also like to ask if specific legislation and policies will be introduced for women going on maternity leave. If there are cases in which a pregnant mother has to go on maternity leave, she should not be automatically given a lower band by default during her subsequent appraisal simply by virtue of taking what is a statutorily mandated leave. Guidelines should be available for the employer to objectively evaluate her performance and for the employee herself to be able to fulfil them reasonably. This can help to address the unequal pay or promotion which can slow down further career progression down the road."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00927,2022-04-05-T-017,927,Shahira Abdullah,"Additionally, what provisions or measures can be introduced that would ensure women are not discouraged from taking their statutorily mandated maternity leave at risk of penalty to their career progression? While the White Paper champions autonomy of choice for women, I am concerned that women may be presented with a false choice and come under increased pressure to view their recovery during the duration of the maternity leave as optional, especially for women who aspire to hold leadership positions in future."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00928,2022-04-05-T-017,928,Shahira Abdullah,"Thus, they may either opt not to take the full duration of their maternity leave or choose to continue working throughout the duration of their maternity leave."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00929,2022-04-05-T-017,929,Shahira Abdullah,"Anecdotally as well, it seems a handful of employers may encourage women to work throughout their maternity or seek to postpone or do away with their time away with the promise that doing so would lead to greater career progressions. I think a stronger message needs to be sent that maternity is not an optional leave but one that is statutorily protected because Parliament recognises there is a need for women to recover from the procedures and many bodily changes introduced by pregnancy and labour. There is a greater social good being encouraged by preserving the maternity leave for women and ensuring that it is observed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00930,2022-04-05-T-017,930,Shahira Abdullah,"Secondly, I am also glad to see the introduction of the new Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024 which requires employers to consider employees' flexi-work requests fairly and properly. There are many ways FWAs can be implemented, whether flexi-place, flexi-time or flexi-load. Being able to do so would allow employers to adopt the best practices to manage their workforce while, at the same time, allowing them to tap on talents that they may not have been able to traditionally."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00931,2022-04-05-T-017,931,Shahira Abdullah,"This is also a major step forward to weaken gender norms. Instead of work structures that reward employees for pulling more hours at work, a transition to one which is supportive of a family-friendly work culture would encourage both parents to balance work and family commitments."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00932,2022-04-05-T-017,932,Shahira Abdullah,"However, such benefits should not be solely used by women as the perceived costs of hiring them will increase. According to MSF, only 55% of fathers used up their paternity leave. This was mainly due to workplace support. Fathers are worried that it might affect their career prospects. Employers also have to ensure that colleagues are willing to cover the fathers' duties in their absence. I understand that the White Paper will be tackling this aspect in Action 4. Therefore, may I ask whether there are similar upcoming plans to ensure increased utilisation of FWAs, not by women, but by men as well?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00933,2022-04-05-T-017,933,Shahira Abdullah,"In a similar vein, an NUS study in 2021 showed that men with lower incomes were less likely to utilise their paternity leave. This was especially prominent in those involved in manual labour. Hence, could I suggest for provisions to be made to allow for some amount of paternity leave to be made compulsory? This will be a strong signal to the community regarding the importance of shared gender responsibilities as equal partners as well as towards enhancing the support of women in low-income families as well."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00934,2022-04-05-T-017,934,Shahira Abdullah,"Thirdly, employers or institutions which are able to adopt such family-friendly practices should be rewarded for their commitment to gender equality in the workplace. These efforts are not easy to adopt, especially since it also relies on the mindset change and support of society to make it work. This is also in line with the Government's moves to encourage marriage and parenthood to boost the total fertility rate."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00935,2022-04-05-T-017,935,Shahira Abdullah,"Lastly, it is evident that everyone plays a part in the progress of women's development which is why I believe mindset change is the most critical step in this whole endeavour of policy, legislative and structural changes. It is reflected in the choices that we make every day. As fathers, when we make an effort to share the mental load and burden of household responsibilities; as parents and educators when we decide what kind of examples we set with our behaviour; as employers and colleagues when we show understanding to fellow parents at work or as consumers where we take a stand to not consume sexist content."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00936,2022-04-05-T-017,936,Shahira Abdullah,"Only with everyone taking a conscious step and working hand-in-hand will our efforts bear fruit much faster with far-reaching effects. With that, I support this Motion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00937,2022-04-05-T-017,937,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. The White Paper encapsulates the collective aspirations of women in Singapore. Importantly, it tackles the deep and long-running concerns and stigma and discrimination our women face at home, at school, workplaces and the community. Regardless of where women are in their lives, we, as a society, must support them. Let it be their choice and not a decision or judgement that we impose on them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00938,2022-04-05-T-017,938,Wan Rizal,"Hence, I welcome the 25 concrete action plans that have been tabled in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00939,2022-04-05-T-017,939,Wan Rizal,"Sir, I would like to touch on two areas  supporting career aspirations and supporting their children's well-being."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00940,2022-04-05-T-017,940,Wan Rizal,"Sir, the pandemic has taught us that physical meetings can be replaced by virtual ones and matters can be easily resolved over emails. Importantly, we saw how FWAs allowed organisations to remain productive while allowing workers to juggle other commitments at home. This alleviates the mental burden faced by women who are caregivers but, at the same time, it allows the husbands the opportunity to share the load. Importantly, it can also encourage women who have not been working for some time to return to the working world with ease."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00941,2022-04-05-T-017,941,Wan Rizal,"I commend efforts, such as Mums@Work, Career Navigators and MENDAKI Sense's back-to-work women programme, which mentor women who wish to get back to the working world, retain them, retrain them and partner companies to ensure a smooth transition. In that regard, I welcome the recent news by MOM that employers must consider staff requests for FWAs by 2024."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00942,2022-04-05-T-017,942,Wan Rizal,"However, I hope that the Government can push the deadline earlier and explore accreditation models for companies that support FWAs and have concrete back-to-work women HR policies within their organisations. Staff welfare clubs for women or the set-up of childcare arrangements within the building can also be implemented to allow women to have a strong support group within workplaces and allow their children to be near them while they work. Hence, I hope more companies can consider rolling them out to allow more women to return to the workforce."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00943,2022-04-05-T-017,943,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, the second area I would like to highlight is the need for us to support women in their children's well-being."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00944,2022-04-05-T-017,944,Wan Rizal,"Sir, apart from my mother and my wife, my late grandmother continues to be my inspiration."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00945,2022-04-05-T-017,945,Wan Rizal,"When my mother was born, her father passed on soon after. My grandmother raised seven children on her own. She held multiple jobs. She was a religious teacher teaching Quranic recitation; she was a seamstress, sometimes doing clothes for free so that the children in the kampung can have nice clothes; she was somewhat an entrepreneur, she cooked and sold epok epok in the kampung, too. She was a resilient woman. She held a tight ship, ensuring ends meet and that the children were well cared for. My mother, being the youngest, had sisters who were doubling up as mothers. In situations like this, the elder ones usually make way for the younger ones to support their education. Although things turned out okay for my family, I have seen families of similar profiles within my constituency who are facing challenges."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00946,2022-04-05-T-017,946,Wan Rizal,"During a recent house visit, it pained me to find that the elder siblings who have yet to complete Secondary education, forgo their studies so that they can help with the family income. There were also times I found children who were without preschool education due to multiple constraints faced by single parents."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00947,2022-04-05-T-017,947,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, we need to strengthen support for women in vulnerable groups, those from low-income families as well as single parents. Their biggest worry is their children's well-being. We can help alleviate their worry and better support them mentally and emotionally by focusing our resources on supporting their children's well-being. We need to get the children in school, focus on their studies and set them on the multiple pathways of success."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00948,2022-04-05-T-017,948,Wan Rizal,"Sir, we have now seen an increase in childcare and preschool places around Singapore. Perhaps, we can have more child-minding or student care services in schools and within clusters of low-income families, so that children from vulnerable families can get access to care conveniently while their mothers go out to work and focus on their careers. If we can focus our resources on the well-being of children, I am optimistic that we can help our women from vulnerable families get back up and provide better for their families."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00949,2022-04-05-T-017,949,Wan Rizal,"In that regard, I welcome the expansion of KidSTART and hope that, as the programme continues to expand, the content and delivery are not diluted. Sir, in Malay, please."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00950,2022-04-05-T-017,950,Wan Rizal,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, I welcome the tabling of this White Paper on Singapore Women’s Development and support all the actions being proposed. In my English speech earlier, I have touched on two areas, namely, career aspirations and support for children."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00951,2022-04-05-T-017,951,Wan Rizal,"More Malay women are now serving as members of the Mosque Management Boards, as well as Malay/Muslim bodies in Singapore. However, compared to the number of men, the number of women has yet to reach 50% in terms of those becoming members of board of directors. For example, even though MENDAKI has a female Chief Executive Officer, only seven out of 21 members on its Board of Directors are women. In MUIS, five out of its 19 Council members are women. What about the number of women appointed as members of the mosque management boards?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00952,2022-04-05-T-017,952,Wan Rizal,"I am thankful that during my service as a mosque Chairman in the past, I have worked with many capable women. We already have a woman President of the Syariah Court. In fact, our President Mdm Halimah Yacob is ranked 37th on the list of 500 most influential Muslims in the world. Perhaps, it is time for us to have a woman mosque Chairman?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00953,2022-04-05-T-017,953,Wan Rizal,"I hope that more opportunities and spaces are open for our women to assume leadership responsibilities in our institutions, not just in MENDAKI, MUIS and mosques, but also in Malay/Muslim bodies and private companies, so that a diversity of opinions can be obtained through discussions and policy presentations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00954,2022-04-05-T-017,954,Wan Rizal,"Second, we still see many single mothers and mothers from low-income families facing many challenges. These include those who have to quit their jobs to look after their children."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00955,2022-04-05-T-017,955,Wan Rizal,"I hope that the tabling of this White Paper can further enhance support and assistance for women and children from needy families, especially in terms of providing more preschool and after-school childcare services. With this, mothers can feel reassured enough to return to work and the children will also receive support in terms of their education and mental well-being."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00956,2022-04-05-T-017,956,Wan Rizal,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, the White Paper on Women's Development is a strong signal of the Government's direction towards a fairer and more inclusive society where men and women are seen as equals and complementary in building a better Singapore. While the Government leads the way in legislating these proposals, society, as a whole, must play its part. It is all hands on deck, regardless of gender or age, whether you are a student or a worker, employer or employee, private or public sector."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00957,2022-04-05-T-017,957,Wan Rizal,"To my fellow men out there – husbands, fathers, sons – let us ask ourselves what kind of future do we want to create and leave behind for our women, our daughters? If we want our daughters to be respected, what are we doing within our homes or within the online space? If we want our daughters to succeed in their careers, what kind of work culture are we practising in workplaces? Mr Speaker, I support the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00958,2022-04-05-T-017,958,Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00959,2022-04-05-T-017,959,Hazel Poa,"Mr Speaker, Sir, PSP welcomes the move to introduce workplace fairness legislation to offer protection against discrimination and harassment. In general, we support the plans outlined in the White Paper. There are a few areas we wish to add on."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00960,2022-04-05-T-017,960,Hazel Poa,"The participation rate of women in the labour force has been rising over the years. Women have taken on more economic responsibilities, but their share of caregiving and family responsibilities has not been decreasing correspondingly. It should not surprise anyone if this situation makes marriage and having children more daunting."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00961,2022-04-05-T-017,961,Hazel Poa,"As the White Paper correctly pointed out, mindsets on gender roles need to change."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00962,2022-04-05-T-017,962,Hazel Poa,"Our current parental leave structure reflects the old mindset that needs to change. Currently, maternity leave is 16 weeks, paternity leave, two weeks, and fathers can share up to four weeks of their wives’ maternity leave. With the mothers getting a much longer leave than fathers, it reinforces the idea that childcare is primarily the responsibility of mothers. This is inconsistent with our move to change mindsets on gender roles."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00963,2022-04-05-T-017,963,Hazel Poa,"I urge the Government to change it to equal shares by default, with flexibility to reallocate parental leave between the couple based on mutual agreement, subject to a minimum period for each parent. The default equal share of parental leave between the couple underlines the belief that parenthood is a responsibility that should be shared equally by both parents. Equal parental leave would also give less reason for employers to discriminate against female employees."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00964,2022-04-05-T-017,964,Hazel Poa,"Various studies have shown the beneficial effect of fathers taking paternity leave and taking on a bigger role in parenting. An NUS study found that children are less likely to have behavioural issues and fathers experienced reduced conflict, stronger family relationships and increased satisfaction in their marriage. Another study found mothers get improved maternal postpartum-depression outcomes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00965,2022-04-05-T-017,965,Hazel Poa,"However, not all fathers take paternity leave. In 2019, the take-up rate was only 55%. A key reason cited was work culture that does not support the taking of paternity leave. We should, therefore, look at incentives for employers to provide better work-life balance."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00966,2022-04-05-T-017,966,Hazel Poa,"Next, I will move on to financial support for caregivers. The Home Caregiving Grant is given to defray cost of caring for persons with disabilities who require assistance in performing three or more Activities of Daily Living. This grant is given regardless of whether the caregiver is a paid professional, foreign domestic helper or an unpaid family member. Therefore, it is more a financial support for the disabled person, rather than for the caregiver who may have had to give up a full-time job."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00967,2022-04-05-T-017,967,Hazel Poa,The same applies to the Senior Mobility and Enabling Fund which subsidises the cost of mobility devices.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00968,2022-04-05-T-017,968,Hazel Poa,"Another measure that the Government is changing to improve the retirement adequacy of caregivers is to raise the CPF top-up tax relief cap from $7,000 to $8,000. Can MOM provide the number and percentage of caregivers who received CPF top-ups each year and what was the average amount of the top-up?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00969,2022-04-05-T-017,969,Hazel Poa,"Is this a measure we can rely on to ensure the retirement adequacy of caregivers? If not, would the Government consider a scheme where a portion of the monthly CPF contribution of the working spouse is transferred to the caregiving spouse? It is fair for a married couple who share the responsibilities of family and work to also share the rewards."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00970,2022-04-05-T-017,970,Hazel Poa,"A third area that I wish to bring up is that of foreign spouses. We would like to see greater transparency in the criteria for residency for foreign spouses. With the implementation of COMPASS, we have moved towards a more transparent model for approval of work passes. A similar move towards transparency on residency criteria for foreign spouses would benefit our citizens worrying over how to ensure long-term residency for their foreign spouses and the recurrent cost of visit passes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00971,2022-04-05-T-017,971,Hazel Poa,"There are many good plans in the White Paper. At the end of the day, we need to measure reality. What are the indicators that will be tracked to monitor if we are achieving the objectives stated in the White Paper and what are the targets set? Setting a target shows our commitment. For example, we can set a target for female representation on the Boards of Directors. Since Statutory Boards and IPCs can achieve about 30% female representation, it shows that 30% is a realistic target. Listed companies have a female board representation of under 20%. Will the Government commit to setting a target of 30% within three years?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00972,2022-04-05-T-017,972,Hazel Poa,Another area that is very important to most women would be the sharing of parenting and caregiving responsibilities. Will the Government be tracking and setting a target for this as well as the utilisation rate of maternity and paternity leave?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00973,2022-04-05-T-017,973,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00974,2022-04-05-T-017,974,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, whenever I visit the funeral wakes of my constituents, I try to speak with their caregiver to offer them comfort and find out how I can provide assistance to them and their families. As I listen to them relate how they looked after their loved ones in their final years, I am filled with admiration for their immense dedication and sacrifice. I have spoken to an elderly wife who changed the stoma bags of her husband, who was a cancer patient, for a period of time until he passed on. I have conversed with a son in his 50s, who changed his elderly mother’s soiled diapers several times a day, in a reversal of parent-child roles. I have a 72-year-old resident who continues to juggle her roles working as a cleaner and the sole caregiver to her disabled adult son and mentally incapacitated husband."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00975,2022-04-05-T-017,975,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"These unsung heroes press on out of filial devotion to parents, duty to spouses, responsibility to their adult children and, most importantly, love for their family members."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00976,2022-04-05-T-017,976,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Unlike caregivers of young children, caregivers of elderly or disabled persons face a heavier load over time as the health of their loved ones deteriorates. They do not experience the same delight of young parents watching their children grow up. Their care recipients may not be able to express their appreciation well or may even inadvertently make hurtful remarks due to conditions like dementia."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00977,2022-04-05-T-017,977,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"For caregivers, every day brings new challenges and new heartaches, until that inevitable day when they see their loved ones pass on. Caregivers of children with disabilities face an additional stressor of worrying about who will care for their children if they outlive them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00978,2022-04-05-T-017,978,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"It is a very heavy burden to carry. We, as a nation, society and community, can and should do much more to share some of the weight on caregivers’ shoulders."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00979,2022-04-05-T-017,979,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In 2010, approximately 8% of residents aged between 18 and 69 years provided regular care to a friend or family member, with 37% of caregivers reporting that they had been providing care for almost a decade. These percentages have surely gone up since then and will likely increase further, given our ageing population."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00980,2022-04-05-T-017,980,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In my speech today, I will focus on Area 2 of the White Paper – the caregiving aspect. While caregivers in Singapore are more often women than men, I will not take a gender-specific approach to the problems or solutions. The role of caregiving does not solely apply to any gender and, most certainly, should not be borne only by women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00981,2022-04-05-T-017,981,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Unpaid caregiving of family members incurs substantial direct expenses and opportunity costs. According to a 2019 answer by the Minister for Health to a Parliamentary Question by then-NMP Anthea Ong, about 6% of Singapore residents – male and female – cited caregiving to family members as the main reason for leaving their jobs or not looking for one. The majority were women aged 40 and above."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00982,2022-04-05-T-017,982,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In a reply by Minister of State Gan Siow Huang to Parliamentary Questions by Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Ms Joan Pereira earlier this year, 15% of women aged 25 to 64 cited family-related responsibilities as their main reason for being outside the labour force in 2020, while 6% worked part-time due to family or personal commitments."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00983,2022-04-05-T-017,983,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In his paper published in Insights in Public Health Journal, Dr Wayne Chong pointed out that unpaid informal caregivers of older adults not only pay the lion’s share of mental, emotional, social and financial costs of care, they also fork out non-trivial opportunity costs associated with caregiving, including lost wages, personal freedom and aspirations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00984,2022-04-05-T-017,984,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"These are enormous sacrifices. It is time for Singapore to provide a more comprehensive package of financial support and compensation to caregivers for their economic and social contributions to the nation. I would like to discuss seven ways our nation can share our caregivers’ burdens, many of which have been touched on in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00985,2022-04-05-T-017,985,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"First, employers play a big part in creating a society that values the contributions of caregivers and shares some of their burdens. All employers should provide FWAs for their staff to better balance work and caregiving responsibilities. Managers should be given training to have a greater understanding of the unpredictable nature of caregiving so that they can be more empathetic towards their staff."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00986,2022-04-05-T-017,986,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The White Paper states that the Government will introduce a new set of Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024, which will require employers to ""consider FWA requests from employees fairly and properly"". The Government aims to create a workplace norm where employees ""feel it is acceptable to request for FWAs, while maintaining employers' prerogative to accept or reject requests taking into account their business needs."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00987,2022-04-05-T-017,987,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Can the Minister for Manpower clarify if this means that employers can reject FWA requests without providing valid reasons? If so, it will give employers an escape clause from their FWA obligations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00988,2022-04-05-T-017,988,Gerald Giam Yean Song,I repeat the call in the Workers’ Party’s 2020 Manifesto that all informal caregivers of elderly or disabled family members should be entitled to ask for FWAs that are feasible for their line of work and fair to both the employer and the employee. Employers should be required to provide reasons if the request cannot be met.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00989,2022-04-05-T-017,989,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"It is in the interest of all organisations, large and small, to have meaningful FWAs in place. Employers who fail to do so may lose capable employees to competitors. In fact, having good FWAs can be a company’s competitive advantage in attracting talent. The underlying premise is the basic principle that ""a happy worker is a productive worker""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00990,2022-04-05-T-017,990,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Second, we need to legislate Family Care Leave. Most caregivers remain in paid employment, which places extremely heavy demands on their time. The demands of both work and caregiving responsibilities are often concurrent, making it difficult to set aside one to handle the other."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00991,2022-04-05-T-017,991,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Civil servants are currently eligible for two days of parent-care leave per year. However, according to an MOM survey, only 20% of private companies offered such leave benefits in 2018."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00992,2022-04-05-T-017,992,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"There have been many calls for the legislation of Family Care Leave by Members of Parliament from the Workers' Party, PAP, Nominated Members of Parliament, as well as AWARE and the Singapore Alliance for Women in Ageing, among others."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00993,2022-04-05-T-017,993,Gerald Giam Yean Song,The Government should legislate Family Care Leave soon. This will help in recognising that caregivers’ contributions are on par with that of parents with young children.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00994,2022-04-05-T-017,994,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Family care leave can supersede the current Childcare Leave. As a start, all Singaporean employees should be granted up to six days of leave to look after their young children or immediate family members with long-term illnesses or disabilities. The first three days should be paid by the employer, with the remaining days paid by the Government."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00995,2022-04-05-T-017,995,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"An additional two days should be granted if the employee has more than one care recipient. This means that if an employee has one child and one parent to care for, he or she will be entitled to eight days of paid Family Care Leave, of which three days are paid for by their employer and five days by the Government."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00996,2022-04-05-T-017,996,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The Government rejected previous calls to legislate eldercare leave, citing business cost concerns by employers, manpower constraints and the employability of caregivers. Having the Government bear more costs of Family Care Leave will limit the financial strain on employers and minimise any employment discrimination against caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00997,2022-04-05-T-017,997,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Third, we should recognise the skills and work experience of caregivers. During the caregiving years, a caregiver gains important skills, such as people management, negotiation, conflict resolution and budgeting, as well as domain knowledge, such as healthcare, food and nutrition knowledge."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00998,2022-04-05-T-017,998,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Employers should consider caregiving experience as work experience, just like the Civil Service does for National Service, with corresponding salary increments. Recognising caregivers’ skills and experience could also open up employment opportunities for them in the care sector, which, in turn, can contribute much-needed manpower to our health and social care system as our society ages."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-00999,2022-04-05-T-017,999,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The Public Service should take the lead to steer this mindset shift, and the Government should encourage the private sector to do likewise. Such a paradigm shift will signal that caregiving is, indeed, valued by society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01000,2022-04-05-T-017,1000,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fourth, we need to adjust our approach to financial support and compensation for caregivers. Caregivers should be provided more financial support to offset the costs of home-based caregiving. This support should aim to match the subsidy given to patients in long-term care facilities."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01001,2022-04-05-T-017,1001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The White Paper stated that the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) quantum will be increased next year from $200 to up to $400 per month for low-income households living in HDB flats. To qualify, care recipients must require assistance to perform three or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as eating, bathing, dressing or toileting."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01002,2022-04-05-T-017,1002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,I would like to ask the Minister for Health what was the basis for arriving at $400 a month for low-income families and $250 for low- to middle-income ones.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01003,2022-04-05-T-017,1003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I am also concerned that some patients with dementia may not qualify for HCG. This is because the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as forgetting, impulsivity, wandering and getting lost, are different from the ambulatory and dexterity competencies of ADLs. Can the Minister clarify if dementia sufferers can claim for HCG?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01004,2022-04-05-T-017,1004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"HCG is meant to defray the cost of caregiving expenses rather than financially compensate caregivers. Currently, any financial compensation schemes in place are mainly through family members, such as the Retirement Sum Topping Up Scheme."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01005,2022-04-05-T-017,1005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Over and above financial support, family caregivers should receive some form of financial compensation for their caregiving work. This would mean allowing them to claim a modest allowance on top of HCG so that they will have more savings for their retirement. If the caregiver and their family members are low-income earners, the Government should step in to top up their CPF Special Accounts or Retirement Accounts, without the need for matching contribution by family members."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01006,2022-04-05-T-017,1006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fifth, home-based caregiving services must be made more accessible to all households, especially lower-income ones. The White Paper proposes broadening the Household Services Scheme (HSS) to include basic child- and elder-minding services."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01007,2022-04-05-T-017,1007,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"However, the HSS is not currently subsidised by the Government, even though households likely to benefit most are those without the means to employ a live-in domestic worker. At $20 an hour or more, the cost of home-based caregiving services is a stretch for many such households."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01008,2022-04-05-T-017,1008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"MSF should extend means-tested subsidies to Singaporean families which procure home-based caregiving services for their elderly or disabled family members, if those members are not able to attend centre-based programmes. By caring for their loved ones at home, caregivers save the Government subsidies it would otherwise disburse to care centres. Some of these savings can be passed on to families by increasing subsidies for home-based care."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01009,2022-04-05-T-017,1009,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sixth, short-term and ad hoc respite care services will allow caregivers to run errands, respond to unexpected developments or just get a short break from caregiving."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01010,2022-04-05-T-017,1010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"All full-time caregivers deserve an option to take a day off a week, where they can draw on a shared pool of suitably-qualified respite home care workers or place their loved ones in care centres during their day-off. Full Government subsidies should be made available to those from lower-income households."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01011,2022-04-05-T-017,1011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Currently, respite care services are provided at some senior care centres and nursing homes. As at end December 2021, there were over 450 respite care places, according to the Minister for Health in response to a Parliamentary Question by Ms Nadia Samdin. This is a very small number, considering there are some 210,000 caregivers in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01012,2022-04-05-T-017,1012,Gerald Giam Yean Song,How many requests for respite care did the Agency for Integrated Care receive in 2021? Is there sufficient public awareness of the availability of respite care services? What plans does the Government have to expand the availability and accessibility of respite care?
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01013,2022-04-05-T-017,1013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Finally, long-term residential care facilities may be the only option for many families. Some elderly caregivers lack the strength to even lift their disabled spouses or adult children to bathe or transfer them. Some elderly care recipients are single, with no children to care for them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01014,2022-04-05-T-017,1014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I am not suggesting that everyone rush to put their parents in nursing homes. However, the reality is that with longer lifespans, fewer children and more Singaporeans working overseas, we can expect an increasing demand for long-term residential care for elders and the disabled."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01015,2022-04-05-T-017,1015,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"There continues to be high demand for nursing homes and adult disability home places in Singapore. As of end-2020, 90% of the 16,300 nursing home beds were utilised, up from 85% in June 2019."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01016,2022-04-05-T-017,1016,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Can MOF, MOH and MSF elaborate on their plans to expand nursing homes and adult disability homes up to 2030? How much of our population's future demand will this expansion meet? What are the Ministries doing to ensure that care homes are able to attract enough qualified professionals, including Singaporeans?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01017,2022-04-05-T-017,1017,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, caregiving is a huge weight for any individual to bear and caregivers have made a lot of economic and social sacrifices. Yet, they continue to press on, out of love and duty to their family."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01018,2022-04-05-T-017,1018,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"As a nation, we will need a paradigm shift in our thinking towards caregivers and share some of their burdens. With the support of the Government, businesses, community and Singaporeans, we can strive to be a more inclusive society and better recognise the sacrifices of our caregivers. I support the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01019,2022-04-05-T-017,1019,Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 5.20 pm.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01020,2022-04-05-T-017,1020,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01021,2022-04-05-T-017,1021,Speaker,at 4.58 pm until 5.20 pm.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01022,2022-04-05-T-017,1022,Speaker,Sitting resumed at 5.20 pm.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01023,2022-04-05-T-017,1023,Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01024,2022-04-05-T-017,1024,Speaker,Minister Shanmugam.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01025,2022-04-05-T-017,1025,K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to take part in this discussion for this Motion. We started this process in September 2020. The White Paper is an important marker on this road to equality for women. We have not arrived, but we know the road to travel and the final destination."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01026,2022-04-05-T-017,1026,K Shanmugam,"I do not need to speak about the history of women's rights in Singapore or the issues women face, the details are in the White Paper. They are important, but the topics have been well-covered. I will just make two points. First, the psychological significance of the White Paper and, secondly, I will update the House on our approach to violence which is targeted at women in the family context."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01027,2022-04-05-T-017,1027,K Shanmugam,"First, on the psychological significance of the White Paper. When you try and deal with large issues, like equality of men and women, one, you have to make a list of specific things that need to be done to achieve the end goal. That is important. Otherwise, it just becomes a rhetorical exercise. And the White Paper lists the many areas where more action needs to be taken. The House has discussed them and I am sure will continue discussing them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01028,2022-04-05-T-017,1028,K Shanmugam,"But beyond that, in a more fundamental way, when we talk about respect for women, equality of women, it requires an internalisation by the majority that these are basic values; that these are values which we cherish, which we hold dear. And I have said, when we started the Conversations in September 2020, that our aim is to work towards a deep mindset change, to build a society where every boy and girl grows up imbibing the value of gender equality. To get a change in thinking at the individual level and to have it deeply set in is never easy."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01029,2022-04-05-T-017,1029,K Shanmugam,"I will put it this way. Are we able to say that equality for women is part of our culture that is deeply set in? I think the answer is, it is still work in progress. But the process we started in September 2020 has moved the needle, quite some."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01030,2022-04-05-T-017,1030,K Shanmugam,"The year 1961 was epochal. It was path-breaking. The progress women have made in many fields since then has made the idea of equality more real. From September 2020, the Conversations, this White Paper, I believe, have had a significant psychological impact and moved us further along the path. The scale, the depth of the Conversations and follow-up have registered in our collective consciousness. It has helped in the process of our collective psyche in accepting equality."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01031,2022-04-05-T-017,1031,K Shanmugam,"In law, there is a concept. When you want to know whether something is fundamental and accepted by most, you test it by checking. If I were to ask this question to a group of right-minded people, will they say, ""Yes, of course, it is so"", or will they express different views? If they will say, ""Yes, of course, this is so"", then that is your answer."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01032,2022-04-05-T-017,1032,K Shanmugam,"If you apply that to the idea of equality for women in Singapore, after the Conversations and the White Paper, if someone were to stand up in a group in Singapore and ask about equality for women, will people say, ""Obviously, yes""? I think so. Or put it another way – in a mixed group of right-thinking people, how many will dare to say, ""Men and women should not be equal""? Think of that."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01033,2022-04-05-T-017,1033,K Shanmugam,"It is an achievement that, regardless of whatever one may personally think, if people realise that expressing a contrary view would be against social norms, that means people understand what the norms are. That is important."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01034,2022-04-05-T-017,1034,K Shanmugam,"So, we must not underestimate the power of such collective norm building. The Conversations and the White Paper have helped a fair bit in this process. Over time, if properly acted upon, that can change behaviour on how men and women perceive women and their roles."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01035,2022-04-05-T-017,1035,K Shanmugam,"The current situation in Singapore may look like, well, this is normal, this is the natural order of things. But it is not. Let me illustrate by giving you some examples. In the US, a headline in the last few days caught my eye, that women now have to travel outside the state they stay in, in some places, to get abortions because of tighter and tighter rules on abortions in some of these states."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01036,2022-04-05-T-017,1036,K Shanmugam,"The issue of a woman's right to have a medical procedure autonomy of her body versus a life, is subject to laws in many countries, including Singapore. But it gets difficult when the issue becomes politicised and if you tilt too far away from giving autonomy to a woman over her own body. In Singapore, a woman's autonomy is given considerable weight."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01037,2022-04-05-T-017,1037,K Shanmugam,"If you move to Australia, another matter that has received some attention is the experience of women in the Australian parliament. I am referring to these examples not to criticise other systems and approaches. I am looking at them as illustrations which can remind us of choices we have made, we make on the journey we have travelled and can travel. Coming back to Australia, there were several allegations about how women were mistreated in the Australian parliament."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01038,2022-04-05-T-017,1038,K Shanmugam,"In November 2021, a report, known as the ""Jenkins Report"", was published on what has happened in the Australian Federal Parliament. It sets out in graphic detail some of what happened, quite shocking really. I have prepared an annex that lists some examples. Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I distribute an annex to the Members of the House?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01039,2022-04-05-T-017,1039,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01040,2022-04-05-T-017,1040,K Shanmugam,"If you look at the list, an MP leaning over, grabbing the victim and stuck his tongue down her throat. I am quoting from the report. It is a member of parliament doing this. At an after-work drinks session, a senior party member put his hand up the victim's skirt. A male colleague asked the victim intrusive questions about her personal life and so on. Leaders made jokes about employees' sex life, asked them out for dates, propositioned them. Parliamentarian was completely naked when a worker walked into his office and addressed the worker as if nothing untoward, and so on."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01041,2022-04-05-T-017,1041,K Shanmugam,"For us here in Singapore Parliament, you can understand this is quite unthinkable. I do not mean that in a self-congratulatory way, nor do I seek to draw any conclusions on morality. Just looking at it, factually, our laws and framework and what we expect of behaviour in Parliament, all are different. And the consequences, if you breach our laws, are quite severe. You can expect to be caned if you are a man; and I will come back to the examples here."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01042,2022-04-05-T-017,1042,K Shanmugam,"So, the conduct in the Federal Parliament of Australia, one is tempted to ask  is this the result of a different culture on how women are perceived and can be treated? I do not know enough to draw any conclusions. But Members can see, where we are in Singapore and the road we are on, was and is not pre-ordained. It is because of the choices we made and the work we have put in to treat women properly, with respect."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01043,2022-04-05-T-017,1043,K Shanmugam,"If Members look at the examples, on the right-hand column, in Singapore, just a couple of examples – a man, previously with NUS, holding a PHD. He touched a woman over her skirt during an MRT ride. He was sentenced to 18 days in jail. In another case earlier this year, a masseur molested a customer during a massage session. Nothing as graphic as what you see happened in the Australian parliament. He was sentenced to nine months' jail and three strokes of the cane."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01044,2022-04-05-T-017,1044,K Shanmugam,"If you do these things outside Parliament, you are likely to get jailed and caned. I think it is quite unthinkable that something like this can or will happen in a parliamentary context in Singapore but, if it did, a male Member of Parliament is likely to go to jail and be caned for some of the more egregious conduct."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01045,2022-04-05-T-017,1045,K Shanmugam,"We look at it in the context of how we treat women and what the laws are. All of these fit in together to make sure that there is a certain status, respect and expectation of behaviour. That is important."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01046,2022-04-05-T-017,1046,K Shanmugam,"I will refer to Australia in another context. Last year, in one of the conversations that I took part in, there was an Australian lady. I was taken aback by what she said. She said – and these are in the notes that our civil servants take – and I quote verbatim, ""to Minister's question on her experience in Australia in terms of career opportunities for women as well as support for mothers, the lady said that Singapore offered much better opportunities and support for women. Companies in Australia often took a male-centric perspective and women tended to be politically disadvantaged, especially in rising to leadership positions."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01047,2022-04-05-T-017,1047,K Shanmugam,"Again, a small vignette. If we move forward to the UK, I can recount to the House what a relatively senior female diplomat from the UK told me. Again, quoting from the notes, ""on caregiving, Minister said that we were exploring how we could provide better support. One way was to recognise the caregiving role in monetary terms"" – I will skip her name – ""said that UK had not seriously discussed the question of monetary compensation for caregiving."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01048,2022-04-05-T-017,1048,K Shanmugam,"On my list of examples, let me also share some things that have happened recently in Malaysia. When I say Malaysia, Singaporeans and, probably, Members of Parliament, too, sometimes tend to say on social issues, Malaysia is not a real comparison because we have taken different paths on social issues. But I make a different point."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01049,2022-04-05-T-017,1049,K Shanmugam,"We were part of the same country until 1965. Our cultures are largely similar. The roads we took diverged after 1965. These were deliberate choices and they have led to very different results, and that is worth reflecting on to consider carefully what path we should continue on and what we can do to strengthen the respect and the idea of equality for women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01050,2022-04-05-T-017,1050,K Shanmugam,"I will refer to two events  one early in the pandemic and one just a few weeks ago for Malaysia. In March 2020, Malaysia, like Singapore, was dealing with the pandemic. The Movement Control Order, I think, had been in place. The Malaysian Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development posted infographics on social media on how to ensure harmonious households."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01051,2022-04-05-T-017,1051,K Shanmugam,"It was a document that was obviously intended to be serious and it gave advice to wives. The advice included the following  that the wives should mimic the voice of a Japanese cartoon character, Doraemon, when speaking to their husbands; wives should giggle coyly; wives should avoid wearing home clothes and put on make-up; wives should use humorous words and avoid nagging."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01052,2022-04-05-T-017,1052,K Shanmugam,"The ministry's post, as you can imagine, drew a lot of response. As I understand it, Doraemon is a male robot cat, so, not quite sure why women should speak like a male robot cat. There were many takes on the ministry's post. This is one. With Speaker's permission, can I have this video shown?"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01053,2022-04-05-T-017,1053,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01054,2022-04-05-T-017,1054,K Shanmugam,"Besides this, the same ministry, on 18 March 2020 also stated that only the head of the household should leave the house to purchase necessities. And I think almost in every household, the man assumed that that was them and only them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01055,2022-04-05-T-017,1055,K Shanmugam,"Fast forward to this year, 22 February, the Malaysian Deputy Minister, again from the same ministry, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, she gave this advice to husbands and wives, that husbands should try the ""physical touch"" approach by striking their wives ""gently"" and to discipline them if they do not stop ""unruly"" behaviour. And wives should seek husbands' permission before speaking. And wives should speak to their husbands only when the husbands are calm and relaxed, and after the husbands have eaten and prayed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01056,2022-04-05-T-017,1056,K Shanmugam,"In Singapore, let me tell you, if you beat your wives or vice versa, the Police will come looking for you. And Members will not even consider it possible for either MCCY or MSF to issue such statements."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01057,2022-04-05-T-017,1057,K Shanmugam,"People may think this is a joke, but the differences in approach underlie and make a serious point. The path taken in 1961 and continued has led us to a very different place in terms of how we in Singapore view women and what we consider acceptable to say to women about how women should behave. The White Paper pushes us further along that road."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01058,2022-04-05-T-017,1058,K Shanmugam,"Our cultural norms are now different from Malaysia. We have, as opinion leaders, the power to strengthen and solidify those norms with more action. We can look at positive examples from other countries for us to emulate. Many of them are in Scandinavia, not in all aspects, but in some important aspects. There is still much we can learn from others."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01059,2022-04-05-T-017,1059,K Shanmugam,"To summarise my first point, Sir, the impact on norms and values, the internalisation of the idea of equality – I see that as among the most important outcomes from this process."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01060,2022-04-05-T-017,1060,K Shanmugam,"Let me move to my second point on how we deal with violence targeted at women in the family context. On the whole, if you look at women and how they perceive their safety and security, we have done well."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01061,2022-04-05-T-017,1061,K Shanmugam,"I have told the House before, SPF does regular surveys. The 2018 public perception survey showed that 93% of our women feel safe in Singapore. In 2020, Gallup's Law and Order survey, 97% of Singapore residents – obviously men and women – feel safe walking alone on the streets at night. It is the highest in the world."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01062,2022-04-05-T-017,1062,K Shanmugam,We have made several legislative changes to give better protection to women. Just touching on the changes in the last three years.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01063,2022-04-05-T-017,1063,K Shanmugam,"In 2019, we amended the Penal Code to deal with sexual crimes which use technology; we repealed the marital immunity for rape; we introduced enhanced penalties for offences against victims in an intimate or close relationship with the offender. Usually, women were the victims, even though the legislation is neutral about which sex."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01064,2022-04-05-T-017,1064,K Shanmugam,"In the same year, we amended the Protection from Harassment Act to enhance protection for victims of harassment. The victims are, again, usually women or, quite often, young women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01065,2022-04-05-T-017,1065,K Shanmugam,"Last year, we increased the penalties for sexual offences, including outrage of modesty. That came into force just last month. We intend to take further steps. But for today's purposes, I will deal specifically with violence in the family context."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01066,2022-04-05-T-017,1066,K Shanmugam,"For violence at home, women, again, are more likely to be the victims. The proportion or ratio is three to one, roughly. Members would have read about some cases which were in the news. A woman was abused by her husband on several occasions – punched her, held scissors to her face, cut her hair while holding onto her head. An elderly mother was abused by her adult son for years, starved, not allowed to shower, physically assaulted. She did not report him to the Police, despite volunteers asking her to, because she said she did not want to affect her son, despite suffering all this abuse."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01067,2022-04-05-T-017,1067,K Shanmugam,MHA and MSF set up a task force on family violence in February 2020. The task force came up with 16 recommendations.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01068,2022-04-05-T-017,1068,K Shanmugam,"One common situation, for example, is the threat of violence at home or in a flat. The husband is angry, he is threatening violence; the woman fears for her safety. If the Police turn up at that point, nothing much can be done because if there is no actual violence and no imminent threat of violence, then it is very difficult to do anything. Her husband denies it anyway that he is going to hit. The woman and the children stay in the same flat in fear, and then something bad can happen."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01069,2022-04-05-T-017,1069,K Shanmugam,"Once these measures are able to be implemented – the task force's recommendations – MHA and MSF will respond. They will make an assessment. If the situation is serious, if there has been violence, it may proceed as a criminal case. We try not to criminalise all of these situations because that then does, quite often, irreparable harm in the family context. But where it is necessary, it is processed."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01070,2022-04-05-T-017,1070,K Shanmugam,"If there is no actual violence but there is a significant threat of violence, the wife may be offered the option of being moved to a safe space, depending on the facts. It will be her choice even if there is no criminal offence. She has the option that she can take the children and leave immediately, go into the safe space, then consider her next steps, instead of facing the threat of violence."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01071,2022-04-05-T-017,1071,K Shanmugam,"It could also include moving to a temporary shelter arrangement while working out longer-term interventions. That gives the parties the opportunity to cool down, provides an opportunity for reconciliation. You really do not want every such situation to end up in the matrimonial Courts."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01072,2022-04-05-T-017,1072,K Shanmugam,"We will also empower specific persons, such as the Director-General of Social Welfare, to apply for Personal Protection Orders on behalf of those at risk in certain situations – like that mother who was clearly being abused but did not want to report her son. This will be very resource-intensive and, therefore, will take time to implement. Members can see, however, what we hope to achieve."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01073,2022-04-05-T-017,1073,K Shanmugam,"In conclusion, Sir, if I may say this, the recommendations in the White Paper serve as a guidepost, not the endpoint of our aspirations for Singapore women. In that context, I have shown you some examples – or I call them vignettes and illustrations – of how things happen in some other countries, some things that had happened, and what it reflects and how the road we have taken has made pretty much some of these things quite unthinkable in Singapore. And that is by choice. It is not something that is preordained."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01074,2022-04-05-T-017,1074,K Shanmugam,"We will need to look again at this White Paper and the recommendations, continually review, see how far we have come. And I hope that we can all work to make Singapore a place where every girl and woman can achieve her fullest potential. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01075,2022-04-05-T-017,1075,Speaker,Ms Rahayu Mahzam.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01076,2022-04-05-T-017,1076,Rahayu Mahzam,"For a woman in Singapore to be truly unencumbered to pursue her aspirations and make real choices in her life, we need to address challenges that many women still face today and facilitate the path for her to seek opportunities."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01077,2022-04-05-T-017,1077,Rahayu Mahzam,I join this debate to speak on two salient challenges  coping with caregiving duties and seeking a safe digital space.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01078,2022-04-05-T-017,1078,Rahayu Mahzam,"Caregivers are the cornerstones of our families. Their contribution is part of what makes Singapore a thriving and caring society. I am encouraged to see many men share caregiving responsibilities at home as husbands, sons and fathers. However, some stereotypes remain and women continue to take on a higher load."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01079,2022-04-05-T-017,1079,Rahayu Mahzam,"During the Conversations on Women's Development, many women shared that they struggled with balancing what they were traditionally expected to do as caregivers against achieving their aspirations, and often had to choose one over the other. They hoped men and women could take on a more equal share of caregiving duties."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01080,2022-04-05-T-017,1080,Rahayu Mahzam,"Caregiving is a shared responsibility. I am glad to hear the calls made by my colleagues in this House for men and women to partner each other as equals. Each family should find their own balance, with family members pitching in to care for loved ones and giving each other real choices to pursue their aspirations, regardless of gender. This is a vision we must continue to work towards."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01081,2022-04-05-T-017,1081,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Government understands that caregiving can be a heavy load to shoulder alone. We need to provide more support to caregivers, both men and women alike, so that they can find the balance between caregiving and pursuing their aspirations. Some may choose to dedicate more time to caregiving. Greater support will help them to manage the load better."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01082,2022-04-05-T-017,1082,Rahayu Mahzam,Minister Masagos Zulkifli earlier shared about efforts to support families with young children. Allow me to share more about our plans to strengthen support for caregivers of seniors.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01083,2022-04-05-T-017,1083,Rahayu Mahzam,"We are proud to be a society where children feel an innate sense of responsibility to care for their elderly parents, but this duty can be challenging."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01084,2022-04-05-T-017,1084,Rahayu Mahzam,"In 2019, MOH launched the Caregiver Support Action Plan to support caregiving for seniors. We will build on these efforts to recognise and empower caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01085,2022-04-05-T-017,1085,Rahayu Mahzam,"Firstly, we will enhance the options for respite care to ease the caregiving load. Caregiving can be a long journey – a marathon, rather than a sprint. Crystal Lee is one example of a caregiver who has had a long caregiving journey. She started at the young age of 13, caring for her father, who suffered from various cancers. Later on, she also took care of her mother who suffered from a stroke. More than 20 years later, Crystal continues to care for her mother. Her father has since passed on. Crystal shared that her mother goes to the nearby day care centre, giving Crystal time to rest and recharge. She also taps on the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) to help her reduce her care costs. These alternative care arrangements have given Crystal space to pursue her hobbies and continue working as a part-time nurse."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01086,2022-04-05-T-017,1086,Rahayu Mahzam,"Today, we have a range of eldercare and respite care services that help to ease the caregiving load of caregivers like Crystal, allowing them to rest and pursue other goals, with peace of mind that their loved ones are well cared for. MOM recently announced plans to broaden the Household Services Scheme to provide basic elder-minding and child-minding services. This provides another option for caregivers to tap on to take a break."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01087,2022-04-05-T-017,1087,Rahayu Mahzam,"Nonetheless, some caregivers shared during the Conversations that they were unaware of the respite options available. Others hoped to access respite care more readily. I would like to assure Mr Gerald Giam that MOH is reviewing the respite care landscape to better meet the needs of caregivers and make respite care more accessible, affordable and available. We will share more details in due course."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01088,2022-04-05-T-017,1088,Rahayu Mahzam,"Secondly, MOH will continue to explore ways to enhance our care ecosystem. Over the years, we have expanded the capacity and range of eldercare services to meet the care needs of our seniors. Many seniors and their caregivers have benefited from these services."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01089,2022-04-05-T-017,1089,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Gerald Giam have asked whether our care infrastructure will continue to be sufficient. Indeed, as our population ages, the caregiving load on families will grow. Household sizes are also shrinking, with fewer members to share caregiving responsibilities. Some may turn to nursing homes to provide care. However, nursing homes should be reserved for those with the highest care needs and no family support. Many of our seniors also prefer to age-in-place at home. We want to continue to fulfil their aspirations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01090,2022-04-05-T-017,1090,Rahayu Mahzam,"To do so, we need to build on the range of services and support structure in place today, to better care for seniors at home. Some seniors may be less mobile and need more help with activities of daily living throughout the day. Others may need support beyond the typical service hours of their nearby day care centres. MOH is, therefore, exploring further future support to enhance the care ecosystem. Together with the various initiatives announced in the White Paper, we aspire to provide wraparound care for seniors residing within the community, even for those with higher care needs. This way, our caregivers can continue caring for their elderly loved ones in the community, instead of in nursing homes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01091,2022-04-05-T-017,1091,Rahayu Mahzam,"Another area of concern is financial support for caregivers. I thank Members for the various suggestions raised during this Debate. Our caregivers care for their children and elderly parents out of love and not for hope of reward. This value of family support and filial piety is something we should continue to treasure and uphold. Nonetheless, caregivers shared that they feel the financial strain of caring for their loved ones at home, in spending on care options and daily necessities. More financial support can go a long way to help caregivers obtain the help they need to ease their caregiving journey."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01092,2022-04-05-T-017,1092,Rahayu Mahzam,"In 2019, the Government rolled out the HCG to defray caregiving costs. The grant has since supported more than 39,000 beneficiaries. In February 2022, we also rolled out an expanded Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund, which is expected to benefit more than 38,000 seniors in 2022. Since then, we have reviewed the HCG and enhanced it to recognise caregivers' contributions and further reduce caregiving costs. The grant will be increased from $200 per month to up to $400 per month, with more help provided to lower-income families."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01093,2022-04-05-T-017,1093,Rahayu Mahzam,"Members of the House have expressed their support for this enhancement, and rightly so. The enhanced HCG builds on multiple layers of financial support provided today to defray the costs of care for those living at home. As a start, the Government already provides generous means-tested subsidies of up to 80% for centre- and home-based eldercare services. A care recipient using these community care services may benefit from subsidies of more than $8,000 per year. Other support includes grants and insurance schemes like CareShield Life and ElderShield."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01094,2022-04-05-T-017,1094,Rahayu Mahzam,"Together, these go a long way in helping to lighten the financial load on caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01095,2022-04-05-T-017,1095,Rahayu Mahzam,"Some Members have made suggestions calling for even more financial support. These are not new propositions requiring paradigm shifts. We have and will continue to study these carefully. However, we must recognise that any additional support comes at a cost and will raise our long-term healthcare expenditure and impose pressure on our fiscal resources."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01096,2022-04-05-T-017,1096,Rahayu Mahzam,"Beyond helping caregivers afford the help they need today in their caregiving journey, we also need to ensure they are cared for, especially in their old age. Those who have cared for their loved ones for most of their life may have lower savings for their own retirement. The Government has put in place various initiatives to help build up the retirement adequacy of Singaporeans, including older caregivers. The Silver Support Scheme provides quarterly payouts to seniors who had low incomes during their working years and now have less in retirement. Families can also play a part by topping up the CPF accounts of their loved ones. We will support you with tax incentives and matching grants for eligible seniors."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01097,2022-04-05-T-017,1097,Rahayu Mahzam,"I would like to assure Mr Sharael Taha that we will also continue our efforts to make it easier for caregivers to access the support they need throughout their caregiving journey, including preparing for the end-of-life. Caregivers of seniors and those with mental health conditions can look to the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) as a one-stop resource, be it for referrals to care services, applying to financial schemes, or tapping on respite care options. MOH and AIC will also build on existing caregiver support networks and outreach teams to provide more sustained support. To improve visibility of these efforts, AIC and MOH will launch a publicity campaign starting this year, to raise awareness of available resources and where to seek help."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01098,2022-04-05-T-017,1098,Rahayu Mahzam,"This is a journey we need to embark on together to support our caregivers. Family members can share caregiving responsibilities. Employers can be more understanding towards caregivers who need flexible work arrangements (FWA) because of their caregiving commitments. Peers can also make a difference. When like-minded caregivers are brought together, they can provide a listening ear, share experiences and even lend a helping hand. Minister of State Low Yen Ling will share more about the Government's plans to form community-based peer support networks for caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01099,2022-04-05-T-017,1099,Rahayu Mahzam,"Together, as a community, we can lighten the load for all caregivers. Mr Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Malay."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01100,2022-04-05-T-017,1100,Rahayu Mahzam,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I thank my colleagues for sharing their views on the need to support Malay/Muslim women. We have, indeed, sought perspectives from all levels of society in Singapore and across various groups, including the Malay/Muslim community. Hence, we had also involved groups, such as PPIS and the Muslim Youth Forum, in the discussion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01101,2022-04-05-T-017,1101,Rahayu Mahzam,"Besides Government initiatives to support the development of Singapore women, community efforts through our M3 agencies and Malay/Muslim organisations have further strengthened support for women in the areas of marriage and parenthood, employment and others. For example, in employment, we have strengthened support for women to return to work through the Back-To-Work Women programme by MENDAKI, which provides opportunities for women to gain new skills and suitable jobs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01102,2022-04-05-T-017,1102,Rahayu Mahzam,"Many women are strong and resilient and can uplift themselves if given the opportunity. Therefore, we see more women being appointed as leaders, including in religious institutions and Malay/Muslim community organisations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01103,2022-04-05-T-017,1103,Rahayu Mahzam,"To answer Dr Wan Rizal's question, there are, currently, 122 women who have become members of the various Mosque Management Boards. The Syariah Court is led by the first woman Senior President, and she is supported by other women legal professionals, such as the President, Registrar as well as Assistant Registrar, with women making up 66% of the Syariah Court leadership. In 2019, for the first time, a woman, Ustazah Dr Rohana Ithnin, was appointed as one of the four full members in the Fatwa Committee of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01104,2022-04-05-T-017,1104,Rahayu Mahzam,The achievement of women is something that we can be proud of. We will continue to enhance and build on efforts to empower Malay/Muslim women to achieve their aspirations.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01105,2022-04-05-T-017,1105,Rahayu Mahzam,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, I would now like to address the issue of enabling all women to navigate the digital world confidently and safely. Singapore's digitalisation journey has benefited many women by unlocking new employment opportunities, such as in the cybersecurity and technology sectors. Digitalisation has also enabled many women to better manage their responsibilities at home and work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01106,2022-04-05-T-017,1106,Rahayu Mahzam,"However, as more of us go ""digital"", some have, unfortunately, fallen victim to online harms. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann explained how women have been particularly impacted by this phenomenon."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01107,2022-04-05-T-017,1107,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Government seeks to build a digital society where everyone can have a positive digital experience. However, we cannot do this alone. Whole-of-society efforts like the Digital for Life movement, which brings together partners from the people, private and public sectors, are needed to nurture a safe digital space for all."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01108,2022-04-05-T-017,1108,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Sunlight Alliance for Action (AfA), which I co-chair with Senior Minister of State Sim Ann, was launched in support of the Digital for Life movement. To date, AfA’s work covers Public Education, Victim Support, Youth Engagement, Research and Volunteerism. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann has elaborated earlier on the importance of creating a supportive environment for all women online, as we do in the real world, and how the community has worked together through AfA to ensure women and girls benefit from our increasingly digitalised society. Apart from Sunlight AfA, we have also seen various community partners contribute to the ecosystem to tackle online harms. These include the Defence Guild SG, which was launched in June 2021 by a group of lawyers following an offensive online poll sexualising women asatizah. Member of Parliament Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim is part of this effort."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01109,2022-04-05-T-017,1109,Rahayu Mahzam,"In addition to initiatives by the community, legislation is also needed to enhance online safety. Many countries, such as Germany, Australia and the UK, have introduced or are looking into new regulations to tackle harmful online content. Closer to home, the desire for enhanced measures to protect users from online harms is strong. A baseline study commissioned by Sunlight AfA in January 2022 found that 43% of respondents considered stricter enforcement of relevant laws to be the most effective solution to reduce gender-based online harms. In addition, respondents felt that companies and platforms have the most room for improvement in tackling the issue."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01110,2022-04-05-T-017,1110,Rahayu Mahzam,"In line with global trends and citizens' desire for stronger safeguards in the digital space, MCI recently announced the introduction of Codes of Practice to raise the baseline standard for online safety so as to minimise exposure to harmful content; empower users to report and prevent the further spread of harmful content; and ensure online platforms remain accountable on their measures and processes to keep users safe."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01111,2022-04-05-T-017,1111,Rahayu Mahzam,"Moving forward, Sunlight AfA will also be developing a research roadmap to inform future research priorities and measures to address online harms. Given the fast-evolving digital landscape, continued research will be critical in generating insights to help us protect our people in online spaces. As MCI develops these Codes of Practice, we will consult community stakeholders, including AfA members, to ensure efforts to nurture a safe online environment are tailored to meet the needs of Singaporeans."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01112,2022-04-05-T-017,1112,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, Singapore has made significant progress over the years in shifting societal norms between men and women, from one based on patriarchal values to one based on respect and partnership. However, some stereotypes and challenges remain that impede our progress in creating a fairer and more equal society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01113,2022-04-05-T-017,1113,Rahayu Mahzam,"As we mature as a society, our mindsets need to change collectively. Everyone has a part to play, be it in caregiving or in ensuring a safe digital space for all. Let us walk together on this journey and empower all Singaporeans – men and women alike – to pursue their aspirations freely and to the fullest. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01114,2022-04-05-T-017,1114,Speaker,Minister Ong Ye Kung.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01115,2022-04-05-T-017,1115,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, today, we debate an issue close to my heart. I will not just speak as a Member of the House or a Member of the front bench, but also as a son, a father and a husband."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01116,2022-04-05-T-017,1116,Ong Ye Kung,"At the core of this debate are the relationships that all of us have with women in our lives, at our workplaces, in our country. And our duty to women should be equal to our duties to all fellow citizens and the choices open to women must be equal to those open to men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01117,2022-04-05-T-017,1117,Ong Ye Kung,"First, let me ask, what is the place of women in our lives? I will share a bit of my own circumstances. My grandfather and grandmother, they had nine sons, I have no aunties. Of whom, my father was the second eldest. They lived in a kampung in Lorong Chuan, now part of Aljunied GRC. I grew up watching the men in my family breed fishes, plant vegetables, rear livestock, repair cars, there was a workshop in our kampung. And the women cook, clean, look after the children. There was ""men's work"" and there was ""women's work""."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01118,2022-04-05-T-017,1118,Ong Ye Kung,"Then, when my grandfather fell gravely ill, I saw it was my aunties, that means my uncles' wives, particularly my 阿姆, in Teochew, who took care of him. Then, when he died and during the last rites, I could see the men and the women had distinct roles and there were protocols during the last rites observed at the funeral."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01119,2022-04-05-T-017,1119,Ong Ye Kung,"So, from young, I felt some dissonance because I was in Primary school then and, at that time in class, there was hardly any differentiation between boys and girls. If anything, the girls were often the better students while the boys were more playful and many of us were struggling to keep up. School lessons at that time already included stories like 花木兰, Marie Curie. And so, from a young age, we had both men and women as our role models."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01120,2022-04-05-T-017,1120,Ong Ye Kung,"Then, my parents moved into their own flat in Toa Payoh, next to a temple. That was the 1970s. The household composition did not change. I had an elder brother. So, my mother was the outlier, the only woman in the family. But what changed was her role in the family. She was a teacher, which meant she had to go to school very early in the morning, came home, marked the examination papers, marked the homework and then cooked, cleaned, looked after my brother and me; and also coached us in our homework. So, in her, I saw a very strong woman who, in her world, carved out a role for herself that was equal but different from my father. To me and my brother, she was our disciplinarian and also our anchor. Growing up, therefore, my family was mainly men, and women were the outliers."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01121,2022-04-05-T-017,1121,Ong Ye Kung,"Then, I got married. My wife and I had our own children and the situation changed completely. Both our children are girls. I became the outlier. So, today, after my parents' passing, the people I love most in this world are all women. The dissonance I felt as a kid, slowly developed into a deeper understanding of the struggles and aspirations of women. I am not sure I totally get it, but I am trying to get it."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01122,2022-04-05-T-017,1122,Ong Ye Kung,"You see, as a young father, I had thought that whatever discrimination and biases there were against women, it will be alright, my children will be alright, our daughters will be alright because these would, eventually, be scrubbed out by the norms of a modern society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01123,2022-04-05-T-017,1123,Ong Ye Kung,"After all, in Singapore, our daughters have a good education. They are growing up in a world where women can be CEOs, professionals, leaders of nations. And as parents, we will support them to fulfil their ambitions and their aspirations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01124,2022-04-05-T-017,1124,Ong Ye Kung,"But soon, I realised it was not so simple. And I saw it through the eyes of our daughters. One example was when our daughters were just toddlers. During Chinese New Year visits, relatives would glance at them and then turn to my wife and ask, ""When are you having sons?"" My wife will always reply, ""I am happy with two daughters!"" And I know our daughters heard those conversations. I wonder how they felt."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01125,2022-04-05-T-017,1125,Ong Ye Kung,"Then, as a young girl, my elder one, when she first learnt of the concept of dowries, she had a shock. That was over dinner table. I do not know how it came up. And she started asking, ""Why must the groom's family give the dowry?"" We are talking in terms of Chinese tradition, ""Why the four pieces of gold for the Teochews, why the roast pig for the Cantonese and Hakkas?"" She had all these burning questions. My wife calmly answered, ""Because in Chinese tradition, the girl marries out."" That got her even more upset. She said, ""So, this is like a transaction? I will be sold."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01126,2022-04-05-T-017,1126,Ong Ye Kung,"I tried to make things better by explaining, ""The money can flow both ways. And in some cultures, it is the bride's side that provides the dowry in recognition that the husband will incur costs in taking care of the bride."" [Laughter.] It was not a helpful intervention. I would say, if this was a supplementary question, it was a very badly answered supplementary question. We left it like that."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01127,2022-04-05-T-017,1127,Ong Ye Kung,"All children, sons and daughters, are born into this world with no bias against men or women, like my own daughters. But through my daughters' eyes, during their formative years, I better understood the lived experience of social expectations and prejudices. And these are beyond Government policies and legislation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01128,2022-04-05-T-017,1128,Ong Ye Kung,"In fact, policies and legislation, especially those in Singapore, are meant to remove discrimination and promote equality. Instead, we have biases deeply embedded in our social practices and our constructs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01129,2022-04-05-T-017,1129,Ong Ye Kung,"I think they probably had their roots in nomadic bands, where the men mainly hunted; the women mainly gathered. And then, these roots probably grew deeper in agrarian tribes, where the men mainly ploughed the fields and the women took care of domestic matters. The tribes decided to come together to form complex societies. And then, the key problem statement was  how do we, as different tribes, live peacefully together and not kill one another? The answer is to make everyone stakeholders of a stable and peaceful society. And that stake is the betterment of the family, of whom members are bonded by blood and DNA. It follows, therefore, that blood lines must be drawn to define the family."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01130,2022-04-05-T-017,1130,Ong Ye Kung,"The basis to do so in most societies was the patriarchal structure. The expectations of sons carrying the family line, daughters marrying out, dowries flowing whichever way, sons having the greater share of inheritance – often, protected and reinforced the system."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01131,2022-04-05-T-017,1131,Ong Ye Kung,"We cannot undo all these longstanding anthropological practices and history in one generation. But no matter how entrenched, that past is challenged by the present. I think there are at least three driving forces  one, education; and two, technology. And they combine in a powerful way to force a rethink of the status quo."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01132,2022-04-05-T-017,1132,Ong Ye Kung,"Take education, for example. Young girls in Singapore grow up in an environment that their grandmothers would not have imagined when they were children. Education has become the great equaliser of most societies."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01133,2022-04-05-T-017,1133,Ong Ye Kung,"With equal opportunities for education and development, women are now able to enter vocations and professions that were, historically, male-dominated. And education, as a driving force, is now turbo-charged by the advancement of technology. What used to require physical strength can now be automated or done by machines. So, neither men nor women are better at numerical calculation, more empathetic or more meticulous. It is individuals that have varied strengths and weaknesses."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01134,2022-04-05-T-017,1134,Ong Ye Kung,"I was Transport Minister before. During that time, I met many women engineers working in LTA, SMRT and SBST. When I was Education Minister, I met many male students training to be nurses. And, now, as Health Minister, I see many of them serving in hospitals."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01135,2022-04-05-T-017,1135,Ong Ye Kung,"In my GRC, we have two successful women  one, Mariam Jaafar, who was trained as an engineer; two, Poh Li San, she was a Super Puma helicopter pilot. The lines that were once perceived between male and female-dominated occupations are blurring and, the overlap, I believe, will enlarge over time."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01136,2022-04-05-T-017,1136,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me talk about the third driving force that is challenging the past and, that is, our own effort to change the status quo. The patriarchal structure will evolve faster if people now conclude that, as a society, if we treat men and women more equally, it is better for the welfare of our families and our loved ones."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01137,2022-04-05-T-017,1137,Ong Ye Kung,"This will take time. The Government will have a key role. By enacting policies, such as universal access to education, the Women’s Charter and all the various recommendations in the White Paper before the House today, we can catalyse and help accelerate into that new future."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01138,2022-04-05-T-017,1138,Ong Ye Kung,"Society must also play a part, that means, you and I – everybody, every family. I look after a constituency. There are many BTO units and many young couples have moved into them. And I can see many husbands are now significantly involved in household and child-minding responsibilities. Some families even have a breadwinner mother and a stay-at-home father because this is the best play of the family's strength – unheard of in my growing up years."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01139,2022-04-05-T-017,1139,Ong Ye Kung,"Employers can decide, without the compulsion of law, that it makes better business sense to get rid of gender bias in hiring, promotion, appointment to boards and succession planning."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01140,2022-04-05-T-017,1140,Ong Ye Kung,"Having said that, the push for greater equality between men and women is a nuanced and long-term exercise."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01141,2022-04-05-T-017,1141,Ong Ye Kung,"I have highlighted the existence of societal biasness that we need to correct. But at the other end of the spectrum, there are inherent differences between women and men that cannot be ignored and should, in fact, continue to exist. That is what I believe."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01142,2022-04-05-T-017,1142,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me quote Mother Teresa in a message for the World Conference on Women in 1995  ""I do not understand why some people are saying that women and men are exactly the same and are denying the beautiful differences between men and women... As I often say to people who tell me that they would like to serve the poor as I do,"" and Mother Teresa would tell them  ""What I can do, you cannot. What you can do, I cannot. But together we can do something beautiful for God. And it is just the way the differences between women and men."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01143,2022-04-05-T-017,1143,Ong Ye Kung,"Many women I know, including my wife, are against gender biasness in society, but they will also fiercely guard the difference between women and men. Because they know daughters have a special bond with their parents that is different from the relationship that sons have. A woman, in a room full of men, is often able to articulate a different perspective."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01144,2022-04-05-T-017,1144,Ong Ye Kung,"And for mothers, maternal instincts are non-substitutable. It comes from carrying the child for nine months, manifested in a mother wanting to nurse the child after birth."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01145,2022-04-05-T-017,1145,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me offer another quote. This is by a Hollywood star, Denzel Washington. He was paying a tribute to his late mother in one of the talk shows, I think. And he said this, I quote, ""A mother is a son's first true love"" when he is born; ""a son is a mother's last true love"" when she dies. The last three words I added."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01146,2022-04-05-T-017,1146,Ong Ye Kung,"Single or married, mothers or women without children – women have special roles to play in their families and society because of these differences between women and men. However, where does recognising inherent differences stop, and biasness and stereotypes begin? It is a very difficult and sensitive question, which I have no answer to."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01147,2022-04-05-T-017,1147,Ong Ye Kung,"During this debate, we hear many examples, many suggestions  how about enhancing this scheme, that scheme? But let us have that broader philosophical question in mind. We want to get rid of biasness but there are also inherent differences between women and men, beautiful differences."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01148,2022-04-05-T-017,1148,Ong Ye Kung,"Look at leave. We only catered for maternity leave in our Employment Act decades ago. And that was a world where women needed to recuperate after childbirth, and where child-minding and taking care of the infant were mostly performed by women. So, maternity leave went to the women. In 2004, we introduced childcare leave, and then, infant care leave in 2008 as we saw men performing more of such roles. Then, in 2013, I believe, we introduced one week of paternity leave. And as we saw more men participating, we introduced a second week in 2017."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01149,2022-04-05-T-017,1149,Ong Ye Kung,"In 2022, should we, therefore, declare all these as family leave, to be equally shared between men and women? Is it equality or are we no longer recognising that there is still a difference between men and women? So, let us be wise when we make such suggestions and choices."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01150,2022-04-05-T-017,1150,Ong Ye Kung,"The recommendations in the White Paper are careful in recognising and striking this balance – championing equality, especially of opportunities and progression, but yet recognising the beautiful differences between women and men. It is a wiser approach."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01151,2022-04-05-T-017,1151,Ong Ye Kung,"There are many practical initiatives – anti-discriminatory measures in the workplace, FWAs, stronger support for caregivers, allowing elective egg freezing, and upholding stiffer penalties for sexual offences."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01152,2022-04-05-T-017,1152,Ong Ye Kung,"Of particular importance are the moves to strengthen the family support infrastructure, which are empowering for women at various stages of their lives."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01153,2022-04-05-T-017,1153,Ong Ye Kung,"On this, let us also have some perspective. It is not difficult to ask for more subsidy. Taking the Home Care Grant (HCG), for example, $400 is not enough, increasing from $200 to $400 is not enough, so, let us increase some more, give to more people. From a technical perspective, the HCG is not universal but broad-based. No doubt, if you transfer someone from a nursing home to a homecare environment, the Government saves on subsidies and we can think about how to help such individuals and such families more. But when you implement HCG, it does not cater to just this group. It is, actually, quite broad-based – whoever meets the means-tested criteria is eligible. So, it is not cheap. It is quite a big scheme."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01154,2022-04-05-T-017,1154,Ong Ye Kung,"And if you want to expand it, double it, expand the number of recipients, you are looking at more budget. So, where does the budget come from? It has to come from some taxes and if you cannot raise taxes, if you object to raising taxes, then where will the money come from? So, we will continue to find ways to support families  from housing to education to, generally, having a safe, peaceful environment to bring up children as well as for homecare."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01155,2022-04-05-T-017,1155,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been speaking as a son, father and husband. Now, let me speak as a man, to fellow men. I say let us all be stakeholders in a fair and equal society. At the most basic level, let us respect women through our words and actions. Offences against women are clearly wrong and the vast majority of us agree with that. Perhaps what is less obvious is the occasional insensitive remark that reflects an unconscious bias or stereotype."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01156,2022-04-05-T-017,1156,Ong Ye Kung,"Understand and see things from a woman’s point of view. Stop mansplaining, using diminutives, or doing things in the presence of women that they feel embarrassed by."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01157,2022-04-05-T-017,1157,Ong Ye Kung,"Let us be more proactive in supporting the women in our lives, just as they support us. This could mean undertaking the roles that society often expects women to do, like household chores, parenting, arranging for food during a gathering or conference or Parliament Sitting. Many men already do these things and we can, certainly, do more as equal partners in society, and in solidarity with women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01158,2022-04-05-T-017,1158,Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, while we accord women respect, let us take a step further to be chivalrous. I may be old-fashioned, but I personally think there is much virtue in men extending a special courtesy to women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01159,2022-04-05-T-017,1159,Ong Ye Kung,"To be honest, I often feel uneasy, just because I am a Minister, that people, including my female staff, will attempt to carry my bag or open the door for me. And I will always try to stop them and offer to open the door for them instead, often reminding them etiquette comes before protocol."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01160,2022-04-05-T-017,1160,Ong Ye Kung,"Such courtesy is timeless. It does not lessen the person at the receiving end or imply that they cannot do it themselves! They are perfectly capable of doing it themselves. Instead, it adds a certain appreciation and complementarity to the relationship between women and men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01161,2022-04-05-T-017,1161,Ong Ye Kung,"I want to make a special shout-out to our youths, having met many of them during my time as Minister for Education. I say to them  be kind to all your friends, accord respect and courtesy to one another, listen to the views of everyone, girls and boys, keep the games and the jokes appropriate and tasteful – not from your point of view, but from theirs."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01162,2022-04-05-T-017,1162,Ong Ye Kung,"Sexual offences are a rising problem amongst your generation. The boys might be uncomfortable with hearing this, but I think it is important you hear this. Never be part of the problem, but be part of the solution. When in doubt, always do the right thing. Watch out for the girls and, if it is late at night, offer to walk them to the bus stop, to the MRT station or to their destinations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01163,2022-04-05-T-017,1163,Ong Ye Kung,"Most of you take wefies now. But on those rare occasions where you take a photo with your class, your CCA group or with the Minister, do not let the girls kneel in front and you stand at the back comfortably. So, boys, volunteer to squat in front. Or at least position yourselves freely as equals. Safe management measures (SMM) restrictions are now lifted, you can now take group photos again without one-metre spacing. So, make this the new post-COVID-19 norm!"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01164,2022-04-05-T-017,1164,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, to end the speech, let me talk about a familiar character in Chinese history – which is 花木兰 (Hua Mulan). Members are familiar with the story. A poem was written about her called ""The Ballad of Mulan"" or 木兰辞."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01165,2022-04-05-T-017,1165,Ong Ye Kung,"I thought the last few lines are particularly meaningful. In Chinese, it goes like this"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01166,2022-04-05-T-017,1166,Ong Ye Kung,"雄兔脚扑朔, 雌兔眼迷离；"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01167,2022-04-05-T-017,1167,Ong Ye Kung,双兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌!
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01168,2022-04-05-T-017,1168,Ong Ye Kung,"Roughly translated, it says  when you catch hold of a rabbit, the male will kick its legs; if you catch hold of a female rabbit, it will close its eyes. But when they run side by side, you cannot tell which is male and which is female."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01169,2022-04-05-T-017,1169,Ong Ye Kung,"This was written in 400 AD, during the era of Northern Wei (北魏). Even in highly patriarchal ancient China, there was recognition that there are inherent differences between men and women. But there are many roles that can be equally performed by both women and men."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01170,2022-04-05-T-017,1170,Ong Ye Kung,"As our daughters grow up and start their own families, they will likely face the same dilemma as many women today, juggling multiple responsibilities and feeling guilty if they fall short of being the ""superwoman"" who can handle it all."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01171,2022-04-05-T-017,1171,Ong Ye Kung,"But if my daughters decide as a life priority to start a family and spend more time as mothers to bring up their children, even at the expense of their career progression, I will be immensely proud of them. And if they decide they prefer to be single and use their talents to contribute to community and society, I will also be immensely proud of them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01172,2022-04-05-T-017,1172,Ong Ye Kung,"But whichever priority they put greater weight on, whatever life course they choose, they should not be pressured to do so. This shall be their choice."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01173,2022-04-05-T-017,1173,Ong Ye Kung,"As a son, father and husband, and a Member of this House, I see our collective duty to support women in whatever they set out to do and accelerate away from our antiquated past of women and men stereotypes, at home, at work, in society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01174,2022-04-05-T-017,1174,Ong Ye Kung,"The future that we envision must be a society that dispels unconscious bias, promotes the right value of mutual respect between all individuals, upholds meritocracy and provides as much support as we can to enable caregivers to find better balance in their roles."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01175,2022-04-05-T-017,1175,Ong Ye Kung,"In my mind, this equality to freedom of choice is the heart of this White Paper and the reason why I strongly support it. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01176,2022-04-05-T-017,1176,Speaker,Mr Darryl David.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01177,2022-04-05-T-017,1177,Darryl David,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in 2017, I spoke about a greater need to support women, especially mid-career women, at work. In that speech, I touched on how women tend to ""leak out"" of the promotion pipeline at the mid-career stage because the mid-career period tends to coincide with the stage of their lives where women experience heavy maternity and family commitments."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01178,2022-04-05-T-017,1178,Darryl David,"Due to these commitments, many of them either exit the workforce, take on an involuntary career slow-down or are assigned to what some may call the ""mommy track"" by their companies. Because of these reactions, the career gaps between women and men widen as the organisational hierarchy progresses."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01179,2022-04-05-T-017,1179,Darryl David,"Mr Speaker, there is one thing that COVID-19 has taught us about work and working from home. It would be that FWAs in the form of working from home and such hybrid work arrangements where time is spent between working from home are working out just as well as being physically present in the office, which is the more traditional working arrangement."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01180,2022-04-05-T-017,1180,Darryl David,"Many Members of this Chamber have already talked about FWAs and, indeed, FWAs are covered and highlighted in the White Paper. FWAs might just be the right solution that enables women in their mid-career to have the best of both worlds. However, as we are also lauding the merits of FWAs because they enable women to manage both their work and their family commitments, we need to be mindful also that there could be potential downsides for women when FWAs are applied in too broad strokes."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01181,2022-04-05-T-017,1181,Darryl David,"A 2017 article written by Singaporean researchers from the Human Capital Leader Institute (HCLI) published in the Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD, highlighted the need to have a more nuanced approach when implementing pro-family policies to support women. Among the issues highlighted in the article, it was identified that a prolonged period of working from home may, in fact, have a dampening effect on the career development of women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01182,2022-04-05-T-017,1182,Darryl David,"One of the effects was the result in female executives being cut off from informal channels within the company and then, subsequently, encountering difficulties in obtaining resources necessary for work through informal company and industry networks."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01183,2022-04-05-T-017,1183,Darryl David,"So, for women in their mid-career to truly benefit from FWAs, companies need to be cognisant of the potential impingement of the formation of informal professional networks that may result from the prolonged reliance on such arrangements. Companies, therefore, need to proactively assist women to manage the risk of such professional isolation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01184,2022-04-05-T-017,1184,Darryl David,"One of the ways that companies can mitigate this is to implement a system of corporate mentorship and sponsorship for female executives. As mentors and sponsors, senior executives are responsible for providing career guidance to female executives, helping them open doors to high-visibility projects, connecting them with professional networks within the company and across the industry, and also ensuring that they receive the resources they need for project implementation."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01185,2022-04-05-T-017,1185,Darryl David,"Through this process, female executives can continue to have a channel into the senior corporate network, thereby ensuring that they continue to have the corporate visibility and exposure they need to advance their career even though they choose to opt for a more FWA."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01186,2022-04-05-T-017,1186,Darryl David,"The second area I would like to speak on is specialised support for mothers who are returning to work. Even though both men and women are equally susceptible to experiencing work-family conflicts, women are more likely to experience these conflicts more frequently and at greater intensity than men do. This is largely due to societal expectations that place a greater degree of family responsibilities on women even when they are full-time professionals and a greater degree of social sanctions that women will experience than men when they fail to juggle between work and family responsibilities."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01187,2022-04-05-T-017,1187,Darryl David,"As a result, many working women have chosen to take a break from work to concentrate on meeting their family responsibilities before returning to work when their children are old enough to be independent."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01188,2022-04-05-T-017,1188,Darryl David,"Juggling between work and family can be daunting, especially so for women who are returning to work after prolonged periods of non-work arising from the need to meet family responsibilities. Many of these return-to-work moms will, inevitably, experience a skills-gap issue where their knowledge about their trade could have become obsolete over time, they could have also lost business networks that they used to have, and they might not be fully up-to-date on the type of professional openings that are available on the market."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01189,2022-04-05-T-017,1189,Darryl David,"To better assist return-to-work moms, it would be good if NTUC’s e2i division or their Women and Family initiative can conduct unique career coaching sessions to ensure that women returning to work are fully aware of the type of opportunities available in the market and they also have access to skills upgrading courses that enable these return-to-work moms to pick up new and relevant skills that will make them a better fit for the market."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01190,2022-04-05-T-017,1190,Darryl David,"An idea that is also worth exploring is to create more networks of entrepreneurs or business professionals to guide, mentor and advise mothers who are perhaps thinking of starting their own business."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01191,2022-04-05-T-017,1191,Darryl David,"The COVID-19 pandemic has, definitely, resulted in the rise of more home businesses and, rather than return to conventional employment, perhaps some of these ""mumpreneurs"" might want to scale up their businesses, so as to allow themselves the opportunity to generate an income while also having the flexibility to attend to their other personal and familial duties."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01192,2022-04-05-T-017,1192,Darryl David,"Indeed, having more of these networks, like ""Mumpreneurs-Go-Places"", for example, could help to coalesce and bond this group of mumpreneurs, who would then be able to provide mutual advice, help, support and guidance for one another. It would be good if the Government could also perhaps consider providing some start-up grants and support for such mumpreneurs or perhaps explore avenues of micro-financing that would be useful to them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01193,2022-04-05-T-017,1193,Darryl David,"Mr Speaker, Sir, a wicked problem is defined as a social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve – normally, because of its complex and interconnected nature. Indeed, as we work towards parity, equality for women in Singapore, we are taking on what perhaps is becoming less and less of a ""wicked problem"", but still one that has no simple and easy solution. Because, while the Government can take the lead in outlining concrete steps to support women, it takes a whole-of-society effort to actually move this needle significantly."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01194,2022-04-05-T-017,1194,Darryl David,"Solving issues, such as unconscious biases and glass ceilings at work, require companies to take proactive steps, such as sponsoring the careers of high potential female executives. Resolving the challenges faced by working moms and return-to-work moms requires not only strong support from their family members, but also a system to integrate and reintegrate these women into the professional working network. My comments notwithstanding, I am supportive of the White Paper and hope that this will provide the foundations for Singapore women to grow, develop and thrive in our community and society."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01195,2022-04-05-T-017,1195,Speaker,Ms Tin Pei Ling.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01196,2022-04-05-T-017,1196,Tin Pei Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak in this meaningful debate on the White Paper on Singapore Women's Development. This marks yet another key milestone in Singapore's long journey towards removing barriers and empowering Singapore women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01197,2022-04-05-T-017,1197,Tin Pei Ling,"This House has seen many exchanges and recommendations on how we can empower and advance Singapore women over the past six to seven decades. Personally, since entering this House in 2011, I have also heard many suggestions made by fellow Members of Parliament (MPs) and seen real policy changes implemented to resolve pain points and provide stronger support to Singapore women."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01198,2022-04-05-T-017,1198,Tin Pei Ling,"Humbly, I, together with fellow PAP women MPs, have contributed modestly to the cause by moving a private Members' Motion titled ""Aspirations of Women"" in 2017. Therefore, now that a White Paper is completed and introduced, this is certainly a significant leap forward as tangible actions will be taken to further Singapore Women's Development."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01199,2022-04-05-T-017,1199,Tin Pei Ling,"And, of course, in this House, I have also covered a range of topics talking about women and place of women in tech, as well as digital competency. But in this speech today, I would like to just share and address two pieces of feedback I have heard so far and some suggestions in the area of empowering women in their careers and protecting girls from harm."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01200,2022-04-05-T-017,1200,Tin Pei Ling,"One category of comments I have heard is whether we are overly promoting women's rights. Comments include, some jokingly and some not so jokingly, whether we should also have a Men's Charter or White Paper on Singapore Men's Development and whether we should promote women to higher positions for the sake of it, thereby compromising meritocracy potentially."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01201,2022-04-05-T-017,1201,Tin Pei Ling,"Clearly, efforts to champion Singapore Women's Development cannot be to demand women's rights just because it sounds politically appealing. Rather, it is about ensuring fair play and choice. It is to ensure that, for instance, between a male and female candidate of comparable competency or potential, the female one does not get filtered out or be considered as a lesser candidate because of biases, such as ""Oh, she is of childbearing age and may have to take time off to give birth"" or ""Oh, she has young kids and will have to take childcare leave or be distracted now and then"". This was something that I experienced in 2015, when I first gave birth. I remember this as a comment during the General Election; this was levelled against me. Or that ""women are more emotional, less decisive and harder to follow."""
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01202,2022-04-05-T-017,1202,Tin Pei Ling,"Well, we need to address such attitudes and comments. First, there is a need to make the entire environment – employers and society – to be more empathetic and supportive towards women. Second, just as women in Singapore today have control over our own bodies as law enforcement authorities do not turn a blind eye to crimes against women, there is also a need to punish and deter the worst abuses against women at the workplace as well. This is to ensure that women are not disadvantaged for recruitment and promotion. Third, beyond breaking the biases, it is also putting in place support to free up women's capacity, so that they can pursue other worthy aspirations to be an equal partner."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01203,2022-04-05-T-017,1203,Tin Pei Ling,"We have seen women going places, we have seen how women are able to hold our own and make it out fair, and yet, we have to ask ourselves  is it enough? Is it already levelled? Are there other barriers that are in place, that are prohibiting women from going out there to fulfil their fullest potential? Therefore, with this Paper, and by supporting Singapore Women's Development, I believe it is also about fulfilling the potential that has been untapped."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01204,2022-04-05-T-017,1204,Tin Pei Ling,"So, this leads to the topic of caregiving. Another feedback that I have heard is whether having a whole segment on caregiving in a paper titled ""Singapore Women’s Development"" will reinforce the gender stereotype that caregiving is exclusive to women. I fully understand the concern towards this. Anyone can be a caregiver and it is a noble responsibility to care for another life, especially if the care recipient is a loved one."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01205,2022-04-05-T-017,1205,Tin Pei Ling,"Caregiving should ideally be a shared responsibility, regardless of gender. However, the current reality is that women disproportionately form the majority of caregivers. A recent Government survey, for example, found that women in dual income households were five times more likely than men to be managing housework and giving care."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01206,2022-04-05-T-017,1206,Tin Pei Ling,"Hence, even as we continue to educate and change mindsets, we must address this caregiving issue now, so that women weighed down by caregiving duties can have the capacity to also pursue their other life aspirations."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01207,2022-04-05-T-017,1207,Tin Pei Ling,"I am glad that the White Paper recognises this current reality. Furthermore, caregiver support policies are not exclusive to women but benefit male caregivers as well. Notably, the increase in Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) is welcomed. It is a significant increase in support for low-income households. The grant will not fully compensate for caregiving and it is not meant to do so, but it recognises the sacrifices that caregivers make and reduces the trade-offs that caregivers face. The increase in grant may cross the threshold for the household to finally get help, so that the caregiver can take up a part-time job and keep her career on track. It may also mean having funds to get the much-needed respite care, when the stress on the caregiver becomes overpowering and she needs a break."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01208,2022-04-05-T-017,1208,Tin Pei Ling,"I wish to highlight the importance of enhancing respite care. Caregiving is a 24/7 responsibility. It is mentally and physically draining. Hence, readily available and accessible respite care, especially for full-time caregivers, are important to reduce burnout. However, full-time caregivers would usually have been out of the workforce for some time and suffer relatively weaker finances."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01209,2022-04-05-T-017,1209,Tin Pei Ling,"As MOH reviews the respite care landscape, I hope that MOH will also consider  (a) increasing institutional capacity for respite care across Singapore, even as MOH explores home-based respite care, because not all homes are suitable and caregivers, usually, prefer to keep their loved ones near as they may have separation anxiety; (b) exploring more flexible financing options, including greater use of extended family members' MediSave, to pay for respite care services, beyond enhancing HCG, which works like a subsidy."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01210,2022-04-05-T-017,1210,Tin Pei Ling,"On a note related to caregiving, though out of the scope of this White Paper, I wish to again highlight the topic of migrant domestic workers (MDWs). The role of MDWs remains integral to how Singaporean families choose to provide care or supplement caregiving for their loved ones. Firstly, an MDW can offer care one-to-one and, hence, more human touch, more personalised and personable. Secondly, this offers greater flexibility to families with members having to work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01211,2022-04-05-T-017,1211,Tin Pei Ling,"MDWs, therefore, help to free women to focus on work and other pursuits. However, in many instances, the MDWs may have caused more grief than relief to their employers. I had shared the challenges faced by Singaporean families and, indeed, Singapore women, in my Adjournment Motion last November. So, I shall not repeat them here."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01212,2022-04-05-T-017,1212,Tin Pei Ling,I should also note that the dire situation has improved as the supply of MDWs have eased.
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01213,2022-04-05-T-017,1213,Tin Pei Ling,"Nonetheless, there are still instances where employers feel that the system is tilted in favour of MDWs when disputes arise and employers are left to prove their own innocence to the authorities while scrambling to pick up the pieces at home."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01214,2022-04-05-T-017,1214,Tin Pei Ling,"While I understand that MDWs, by virtue of them being in a foreign country, are assumed to be of lesser resource and that over-reliance on MDWs is more a bane than a boon, the reality is that families and, therefore, women of such households need MDWs to support caregiving at home. Hence, I urge the Government to pay greater attention to this matter and be more sensitive to the circumstances and needs of such households, especially those of middle- and lower-income, because time taken to settle these disputes means time away from productive and fulfilling work."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01215,2022-04-05-T-017,1215,Tin Pei Ling,"Another point I wish to highlight is better protection of young girls from harm. Several of my youth volunteers at MacPherson are passionate about this and recently organised a few webinars under the ""Action for Her"" movement centred on protection of girls against online harms. Issues explored ranged from body shaming to cyberbullying to sexual harassments. Hence, I believe the actions set out in Area 3 of the White Paper are pertinent and I support them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01216,2022-04-05-T-017,1216,Tin Pei Ling,"But I also wish to highlight the importance of protecting girls from violent or sexual misdemeanours at home. This can be especially salient in complex family settings that are dysfunctional or where the parents are undergoing acrimonious divorce. Children look up to their parents as role models and they pick up ideas from their surroundings. They must not be led to think that the misdemeanours they are exposed to at home are normal. And more importantly, to ensure that girls in such households and settings are not led to grow up thinking that they are weak and do not deserve happiness like any other. Hence, we must better protect our girls, intervene sooner when necessary, bring them into safer environments sooner, so that they can grow up with the right values and in an environment that brings out the best in them."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01217,2022-04-05-T-017,1217,Tin Pei Ling,"Notwithstanding my questions raised, Sir, I believe the White Paper holds great significance in our continued journey to support Singapore women to fulfil their fullest potential and aspirations. So much has been said in this House, the White Paper's greatest value is that it sets out specific actions to be taken. Hence, I support the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-017-S-01218,2022-04-05-T-017,1218,Speaker,"Leader, would you like to proceed with the Exempted Business Motion?"
2022-04-05-T-018-S-01219,2022-04-05-T-018,1219,,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's Sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No 2."" – [Ms Indranee Rajah] (proc text)]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01220,2022-04-05-T-019,1220,,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01221,2022-04-05-T-019,1221,Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01222,2022-04-05-T-019,1222,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, women today have varying aspirations. Despite the ambitions, most will, at some point in their lives, find themselves being responsible for the care of a loved one. This could be a parent, grandparent, spouse, child, sibling or relative. Yio Chu Kang is a mature estate. I know many of my residents who are caregivers. Hence, supporting caregivers is a subject that I take great personal interest in."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01223,2022-04-05-T-019,1223,Yip Hon Weng,"I agree with the various recommendations in the White Paper to enhance support for caregivers. Certainly, I also concur that men should take up our share of caregiving responsibilities. It should always be an equal partnership. Caregiving is both physically and emotionally draining. Sometimes, it requires round-the-clock attention. It is usually more challenging than what is conventionally regarded as ""real work"", especially with the emotional attachment."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01224,2022-04-05-T-019,1224,Yip Hon Weng,"Yet, unlike formal employment, there is no remuneration. There is only sacrifice and the self-satisfaction of knowing one's loved one is well looked after. Caregivers put their own aspirations on the back burner and this may cause some of them to face social isolation and suffer from low self-esteem, which may result in poor emotional and mental health. They may worry about a time when they, too, will require caregiving, but lack the finances for it."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01225,2022-04-05-T-019,1225,Yip Hon Weng,"While the proposals in the White Paper are laudable, I would like to suggest more services and support with direct benefits for caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01226,2022-04-05-T-019,1226,Yip Hon Weng,"While the proposals in the White Paper are laudable, I would like to suggest more services and support with direct benefits for caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01227,2022-04-05-T-019,1227,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government should consider providing a grant for employers to offer paid leave to caregivers. In the US, some states enacted legislation to create mandatory family leave insurance programmes, to provide caregivers with paid time-off. Several EU member countries, such as Belgium, Denmark and Finland, have various forms of caregiving leave and benefits. This is to ensure that caregivers are not financially deprived from their caregiving roles."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01228,2022-04-05-T-019,1228,Yip Hon Weng,"Paid caregiving leave, together with respite and day care for patients, will allow caregivers to take a much-needed break to recharge. I know caregivers amongst my residents who have not had a real holiday in years, since they started looking after family members with chronic conditions. It is a 24/7 commitment with no scheduled break."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01229,2022-04-05-T-019,1229,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government can consider providing tax breaks for caregivers who have to finance items that are not subsidised under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund, or SMF, such as diapers and nutritional supplements. These are items required on a regular basis and the costs do add up."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01230,2022-04-05-T-019,1230,Yip Hon Weng,"We should also consider tax breaks for caregivers for persons with mental health problems, who may include adult children, spouses and siblings. Include them in the conversations and proposals. This is because the current recommendations are focused on mothers, and caregivers of seniors, children with developmental needs and persons with disabilities."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01231,2022-04-05-T-019,1231,Yip Hon Weng,"Third, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Agency for Integrated Care, or AIC, as a one-stop centre for caregivers must be adequately equipped as a one-stop centre for caregivers, must be adequately equipped to provide support for all kinds of caregivers. Beyond caregivers of seniors, this should also include caregivers of persons with mental health problems and children with chronic health conditions."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01232,2022-04-05-T-019,1232,Yip Hon Weng,"In Yio Chu Kang, I have seen how caregivers need additional support after their loved ones have passed away. At times, they are lost and end up having prolonged grief, which then affects their own mental health."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01233,2022-04-05-T-019,1233,Yip Hon Weng,"The support from AIC must be comprehensive, simple and accessible to all types of caregivers to seek help without requiring onerous research. AIC can better link up with the community and have better visibility. To my knowledge, not many people may be aware that AIC provides support for caregivers, too. I can volunteer Yio Chu Kang constituency to work with AIC on this effort."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01234,2022-04-05-T-019,1234,Yip Hon Weng,"Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, we should consider having a Caregiver’s Day or even a Caregiver’s Week to create awareness and recognition. Like the SAF Day, businesses and organisations can provide discounts to caregivers. The logistics may have to be finetuned, but the goal is to appreciate caregivers for the essential role they play in our society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01235,2022-04-05-T-019,1235,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is said, time and again, that one of the most important things a caregiver should do is to take care of themselves. This has to be a whole-of-nation effort. As a family-friendly society, we can do more to care for our caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01236,2022-04-05-T-019,1236,Speaker,Mr Abdul Samad.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01237,2022-04-05-T-019,1237,Abdul Samad,"Sir, I rise in support of this Motion that clearly reiterates the importance of the role of women in our society. Let us continue to explore more initiatives to provide the continuous and necessary support for women in our journey towards a fairer and more inclusive society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01238,2022-04-05-T-019,1238,Abdul Samad,"When this White Paper was released, I reached out to my female fellow union leaders, both young and mature, who are also female workers. From the exchange I had with them, I will just focus my thoughts on workplace opportunities and challenges, while in my Malay speech segment, highlighting the importance of appreciation and protection for women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01239,2022-04-05-T-019,1239,Abdul Samad,"As we all know, in a recently released labour force participation survey in Singapore for the years from 2012 to 2021, it is very heartening to note and observe an increase in women's participation, from 57.7% to 64.2%. The question is, could it have been more and higher up the ranks? Our collective immediate response must be an affirmative yes! Then, how do we entice and encourage women into the workforce, putting in measures and support that ensure not just a higher labour participation, but further raise the capabilities of our total workforce? In addition, what are the areas that we can identify, so that these women can both bridge the gap in capabilities, if any, and also towards achieving higher productivity, which can, in turn, boost our economy? This may look easy on paper but, in reality, we need more employers to be more welcoming and embracing of women in their organisation, and also emplace them in leadership roles. Women should continue to be given more opportunities for a higher role, based on their capabilities and merits."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01240,2022-04-05-T-019,1240,Abdul Samad,"Understanding women challenges, employers must also do their part by adopting and practising FWAs at their workplace, while, at same time, also applying fair performance appraisal towards women in their organisations."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01241,2022-04-05-T-019,1241,Abdul Samad,"I mentioned fair performance appraisal because this is also an area of concern to some women workers that I spoke to before. While they hope and wish for an increase in the duration of maternity leave from the current four months to six months, deep inside, they are also worried about the negative repercussions for those who have to be away in view of their maternity leave. While these women really hope for the increase for a much-needed rest after each pregnancy and delivery of a child, they also expressed concern that there are instances where they knew of fellow workers losing out in their performance bonuses during this absence, or worse, some do even get less because they are seen to be less capable than their male counterparts."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01242,2022-04-05-T-019,1242,Abdul Samad,"Hence, I call on employers to be more accommodative and understanding towards your female workers in such circumstances. Let us not demoralise the women for their absence but evaluate their contributions in a fair, constructive and also productivity-related work outcome. Hopefully, by embracing an objective performance evaluation through adoption of tripartite standards of fair employment practices, this will, certainly, further increase and improve their morale."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01243,2022-04-05-T-019,1243,Abdul Samad,"Sir, the daily routine of women is much more challenging than men, as after a day at work, they still need to attend to their children and also not forgetting, their husband. Luckily, the clock is just 24 hours because the way women get things done, the clock does not seem to be just 24 hours."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01244,2022-04-05-T-019,1244,Abdul Samad,"A female leader and worker recently shared with me a summary of her observations on the workplace challenges faced by women and I quote in her own words, ""To be honest, over the years, there has been constant advocating against such societal stigmas, and we know, no matter what, the issue of gender inequality and stereotypes still exist today, regardless of within or outside of the workplace. The key question is, how do we provide the platform whereby these guidelines can be put into action and is more legally binding? Perhaps, setting a criteria framework of sorts for companies to adhere to? In short, we can go on and on and on advocating, but what is the outcome since then and now?"""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01245,2022-04-05-T-019,1245,Abdul Samad,"Sir, I can only comfort the leader but, deep in my heart, I know what she said is the real truth and the improvements could have been more and better. Hence, I certainly welcome the move to introduce the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements and boost its adoption of Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements. Sir, I will now speak in Malay."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01246,2022-04-05-T-019,1246,Abdul Samad,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, the position or status of women in our society has progressed over the years and we have seen many women excel in their careers, on par with the men. Notwithstanding their achievements in their careers, we also cannot ignore the ongoing perpetration of violence against women, both physically and emotionally. More efforts are needed to protect women from such violence committed by men, and the worst ones involves victims of any sexual harassment."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01247,2022-04-05-T-019,1247,Abdul Samad,"I certainly welcome the move to increase the punishment for these sexual offences aimed at enhancing protection and support for victims or survivors of any family violence. Although family violence like these usually results in separation, there is one person who continues to protect the family's core. This is the sacrifice usually made by women because men do not have the same emotional capability as women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01248,2022-04-05-T-019,1248,Abdul Samad,"In this situation where separation is inevitable, it is useful for the couple to make informed decisions in the interest of their children. Each divorce does not only involve the couple, but others in the family, too, because it will have an emotional impact on their children."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01249,2022-04-05-T-019,1249,Abdul Samad,"I also hope for more support for single parents who need to manage between earning a living and taking care of their children. Is there a centre that can provide child-minding services so that the affected parents can feel reassured while they are at work? I urge the ex-husbands to show more concern towards your former life partners for their sacrifices in raising your children, by ensuring that the payment of maintenance is done in a timely manner."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01250,2022-04-05-T-019,1250,Abdul Samad,"Please do not make them wait or, worse, plead for the money needed to raise your children, who are born out of the love you once shared with your former partner. In addition, find the time to be with your children so that your ex-wife can have her own personal time, just like you. I would like to remind myself and my fellow husbands and fathers, to love and protect the women in our lives, just as our mothers took care of us from the cradle until the time they depart this world. Furthermore, especially for the wives, please love our wives, pamper them with the things that they want whenever we have the means to do so. Please remember that no amount of money comes close to a wife’s sacrifice when she bears our children, and cares for and nurtures them."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01251,2022-04-05-T-019,1251,Abdul Samad,"In closing, I remind myself and all husbands of a hadith, or saying, of the Prophet  “The world is but an adornment, and the best adornment to the world are the pious and righteous wives.”"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01252,2022-04-05-T-019,1252,Abdul Samad,"(In English)  Sir, each and every man must learn to respect and protect every woman with love and care as though they are part of your family members. Once again, I repeat, Respect, Protect and Care for Women at all times!"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01253,2022-04-05-T-019,1253,Abdul Samad,"In conclusion, if the Labour Movement or Unions have a tagline for our workers, such as ""Every Worker Matters"", then it is only appropriate that this Motion can be a catalyst for the tagline ""Every Woman Matters"", to protect our female workers against any unfair treatment relating to work and employment."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01254,2022-04-05-T-019,1254,Speaker,Minister of State Ms Low Yen Ling.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01255,2022-04-05-T-019,1255,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, today, in this House, we witness a historic milestone in the making of a fairer and more inclusive Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01256,2022-04-05-T-019,1256,Low Yen Ling,"As a nation, we will stride decisively ahead to realise greater equality between women and men. This is an important move to advance Singapore women’s development to higher levels."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01257,2022-04-05-T-019,1257,Low Yen Ling,"Although much has been achieved since the 1961 Women’s Charter, there is more to be done. For instance, women today still take the lion’s share of caregiving duties and many Members have talked about it during their speeches. And some of the common products that we use on a daily basis are made based on men’s requirements, without addressing the needs of women users. But this is changing and will continue to evolve with the plans that are put forth by the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01258,2022-04-05-T-019,1258,Low Yen Ling,"The paper reflects the manifold voices and collective aspirations of Singaporeans, both women and men alike. We hope the paper’s 25 Action Plans will not only improve the lives of Singapore women, but, as a whole, advance our society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01259,2022-04-05-T-019,1259,Low Yen Ling,"Since the start of the Conversations in September 2020, I have had the chance to speak with many Singaporeans of different ages and from all walks of life – from youths and working professionals, caregivers and educators, to corporate and business leaders, as well as our unionists."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01260,2022-04-05-T-019,1260,Low Yen Ling,"Among the diverse views of nearly 6,000 participants of the Conversations, one strong common wish was for Singapore to build a fairer and more inclusive society, where men and women partner each other as equals, and pursue their aspirations freely and to the fullest."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01261,2022-04-05-T-019,1261,Low Yen Ling,"To this end, let me share how three key action plans in the White Paper will uplift, protect and reflect the interests of Singapore women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01262,2022-04-05-T-019,1262,Low Yen Ling,"First, we will uplift caregivers, many of whom are women, by working closely with the community to lighten their load; second, we will ensure the protection of women in sports; and third, we will develop national standards for products, services and procedures to better reflect the needs of women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01263,2022-04-05-T-019,1263,Low Yen Ling,"Today, while women have made headway in terms of greater equality at work and in society, a disproportionate gap persists when it comes to caregiving. Women are still the ones holding the fort in caregiving and shouldering the heavier load. Although there is growing recognition of the need to balance this disequilibrium, it takes time to change long-held gender role stereotypes. Meanwhile, we must do all we can to support caregivers and women who carry out the tough work of caregiving."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01264,2022-04-05-T-019,1264,Low Yen Ling,"In the course of our Conversations in the past one-and-a-half years, many participants had suggested tapping on the ""kampung spirit"" to better support our caregivers, for instance, creating a community buddy system where caregivers can check in with one another and offer emotional support."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01265,2022-04-05-T-019,1265,Low Yen Ling,Let me elaborate on how we will enhance support for caregivers. We will partner the community to push out three key initiatives to uplift and support caregivers.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01266,2022-04-05-T-019,1266,Low Yen Ling,"Firstly, community-based peer support networks. From next month onwards, PA, NCSS and SG Cares Volunteer Centres will work with Caregiver Alliance Limited to link caregivers of persons with mental health conditions together to form networks of mutual support. This will help reinforce ground support for this group of caregivers who are especially vulnerable to burnout."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01267,2022-04-05-T-019,1267,Low Yen Ling,"Volunteers who wish to be part of this effort can go to the C2C, which is the Caregivers-to-Caregivers training programme, to have a better understanding of the kind of mental health challenges that caregivers face."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01268,2022-04-05-T-019,1268,Low Yen Ling,"Second, we will boost help for caregivers of persons with disabilities. Through the Alliance for Action (AfA) on Caregivers of Persons with Disabilities, NCSS and SG Enable will collaborate with community partners to create a buddy programme that pairs experienced caregivers with new ones. For example, the mother of a five-year-old boy with autism, Mdm Feng, tells us that she has benefited from the valuable experience, advice and tips of other parents of children with special needs. They taught Mdm Feng how to use simple occupational therapy (OT) exercises to help her child."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01269,2022-04-05-T-019,1269,Low Yen Ling,"Third, we will co-create new solutions to cater to the needs of caregivers so that they can be better supported in their caregiving journey. NCSS and Montfort Care are leading the Caregiver Community Lab project. It brings together caregivers, residents and community partners to ideate and co-create solutions."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01270,2022-04-05-T-019,1270,Low Yen Ling,"The project was first piloted in Radin Mas and will now be expanded to Tanjong Pagar. Besides synergising the efforts in the two estates, this initiative seeks to better understand the barriers that our caregivers face in accessing support services and take steps to address the obstacles."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01271,2022-04-05-T-019,1271,Low Yen Ling,"Sir, caregiving is a tough and often long journey that can take a toll on one's mental and physical health. Although my caregiving journey for my late father 12 years ago can be considered a short one compared to others, I know how strenuous and stressful it can be because, each day, while my late father was in the ICU and it was a total period of 10 weeks, we oscillated between hope and despair as we kept watch over him 24 hours a day over that 10-week period."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01272,2022-04-05-T-019,1272,Low Yen Ling,Many caregivers go through the roller-coaster emotions on the road of caregiving. Having a network of support from fellow caregivers and care services will strengthen their resilience quickly.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01273,2022-04-05-T-019,1273,Low Yen Ling,"With greater respect and partnership in caregiving, men and women can contribute towards this important role which cannot afford to be neglected, else society and our families may suffer. The Government will spare no effort to boost and bolster new structures of support and create new solutions to meet the needs of our caregivers. With greater community support, we hope no caregiver will walk the journey alone."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01274,2022-04-05-T-019,1274,Low Yen Ling,"Just as how we are empowering and equipping caregivers, we are enabling women to have the freedom and security to excel in sports by providing them safe sporting environments."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01275,2022-04-05-T-019,1275,Low Yen Ling,"During the Conversations, participants had expressed their desire for clear guidelines and measures to deter harassment and misconduct in the sporting arena. Since then, the Safe Sport Commission has, over a nine-month consultative process, developed a Safe Sport Unified Code to enhance the protection of women in sports. This exercise involved key stakeholders, like sportswomen, psychologists and non-profit organisations."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01276,2022-04-05-T-019,1276,Low Yen Ling,"First, the Code has set out a common reference point and understanding of what constitutes misconduct, abuse and harassment in sport."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01277,2022-04-05-T-019,1277,Low Yen Ling,"Second, the Safe Sport Commission has established a central case management service to provide a channel for reporting incidents of misconduct. In addition, there is a network of counsellors and befrienders to provide psychosocial support for affected individuals."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01278,2022-04-05-T-019,1278,Low Yen Ling,"Third, we will be establishing a Disciplinary Panel to hear and review allegations of misconduct under the Unified Code. The Panel will decide on the appropriate penalties and sanctions to be imposed on alleged perpetrators."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01279,2022-04-05-T-019,1279,Low Yen Ling,"Fourth, we will continue to educate the sporting community and public on the Safe Sport Unified Code. The online learning portal, ""SportSG-ED"" has specific modules for coaches and athletes to learn about their roles and responsibilities in sports."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01280,2022-04-05-T-019,1280,Low Yen Ling,"Last but not least, the Safe Sport Programme is testament to our zero-tolerance approach towards any misconduct that threatens the safety of our sporting environment."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01281,2022-04-05-T-019,1281,Low Yen Ling,"Sir, every woman athlete deserves to freely play, practise and compete in a respectful and safe environment. By upholding the standards of the Unified Code, we can keep our sporting environment healthy and positive for all athletes, especially women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01282,2022-04-05-T-019,1282,Low Yen Ling,"Apart from setting respectful standards of behaviour in sports, we are also developing and upholding ""gender-responsive standards"" in our society. This means setting standards for products, services and procedures that consider and cater to the needs of both genders, including those of women. Let me give Members an example."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01283,2022-04-05-T-019,1283,Low Yen Ling,"In the past two years, we have to use masks. Some of us have to use personal protective equipment (PPE). Certainly, our healthcare workers. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as helmets, gloves and safety goggles used in worksites, and so on, need to also cater to the sizes and shapes of women for better fit and protection, instead of being uniformly designed, based on the requirements of males."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01284,2022-04-05-T-019,1284,Low Yen Ling,"To this end, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Singapore Standards Council have recently developed a new gender strategy. It will be implemented across all committees under the Singapore Standards Council, such as biomedical and health, building and construction and quality and safety."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01285,2022-04-05-T-019,1285,Low Yen Ling,"Our efforts are aligned with the vision of the International Organisation for Standardisation and their ""Gender Action Plan""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01286,2022-04-05-T-019,1286,Low Yen Ling,"Apart from developing gender-responsive standards, the Gender Strategy also seeks to increase women representation in the development of standards and raise awareness of their contributions."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01287,2022-04-05-T-019,1287,Low Yen Ling,"So, I would like to use this platform to encourage and urge women with relevant industry experience to contribute their views and expertise to this important work of national standardisation. The ESG website has more details on how the public can participate with their feedback."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01288,2022-04-05-T-019,1288,Low Yen Ling,"We hope that in the near future, the products, services and procedures in Singapore will be increasingly gender-responsive. As addressing the unique needs of women become more a norm rather than an exception, our society will be one where men and women are recognised and treated as equal partners."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01289,2022-04-05-T-019,1289,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, on our journey to build a fairer and more inclusive society, it is vital to have mutual respect and partnership between both sexes, taking care of each other, giving every person a fair shot at success and ensuring that there is equal protection for men and women alike. These are fundamental values that will help us forge a Singapore where women and men stand as equals and where we each have the chance to realise our dreams and aspirations. With this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01290,2022-04-05-T-019,1290,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the recommendations in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01291,2022-04-05-T-019,1291,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Over the years, Singapore has become a place of more equal opportunity for women, thanks to policy efforts by the Government, tireless advocacy by civil society champions and the encouragement and partnership of male allies. Each generation could start to dream bigger. Yet, as we chase the aspirations that we rightfully deserve, we run into social barriers and our own voices are often dimmed by societal expectations and mindsets that have not caught up with the times."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01292,2022-04-05-T-019,1292,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"At the workplace today, three-quarters of Singapore women between 25 and 64 years old are employed. But the types and trajectory of women's careers tend to differ significantly from those of men. There is no lack of women at entry level but female representation tapers off in senior positions. In the boardroom, female representation stands at just 17.6% in our top 100 primary listed companies."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01293,2022-04-05-T-019,1293,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Women are sometimes perceived as too much or bossy when they are assertive and decisive. These women are then seen as less likeable or capable and, hence, less likely to rise through the ranks."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01294,2022-04-05-T-019,1294,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Leadership is not just about the boardroom or in politics. But even stepping back from becoming a prefect in Primary school, for example, for fear of being unliked for the same qualities which are viewed positively in boys, is not something that we want for our girls."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01295,2022-04-05-T-019,1295,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Many fast-growing and well-paying jobs are in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Yet, women account for only a third of employed residents working in STEM. Just 50% of women who graduate with STEM qualifications go on to pursue related careers in this male-dominated space."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01296,2022-04-05-T-019,1296,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Efforts like the mentoring programmes and workshops by Tech for She, a group of working professionals and youth and tech, are an important part of the ecosystem. Institutes of Higher Learning as well have some programmes to attract and retain female STEM talent, such as NTU's Women@NTU initiative, which also supports early career female researchers. But a European-based Microsoft survey found that young girls become interested in STEM at about age 11 and may lose interest by age 15. By focusing women in STEM efforts at the tertiary level, are we too late? I look forward to hearing more about how STEM can be made even more accessible and relevant to girls in Secondary or Primary schools."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01297,2022-04-05-T-019,1297,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"We must amplify the story of women in STEM. Recently, a ground-up initiative, the Codette Project, which believes that every woman deserves an equal chance at success and that tech can get her there, launched an exhibition featuring minority women from different ages and backgrounds in the tech industry. It sends a clear message that these spaces belong to people like us, too, and ""success looks like this"", the name of the exhibition."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01298,2022-04-05-T-019,1298,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"It is, unfortunately, still a reality that women face a childcare penalty. Mother's wages typically stagnate and enter a permanently lower trajectory, especially if they take time off to care for their children. Even when women do not become mothers, studies have shown that the mere perception of this possibility can lead them to being treated differently by co-workers. There are also times when women affected by societal pressures and unwanted reminders of ticking biological clocks hold ourselves back. For example, ""I should not put myself out there for a promotion since I should be trying for a child ASAP after marriage."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01299,2022-04-05-T-019,1299,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I am heartened to note that there are plans to facilitate greater women's representation in leadership roles, strengthen workplace fairness and introduce new tripartite guidelines, calling on employers to consider FWA requests from employees fairly. Beyond guidelines, I also hope that societal norms will change as both parents become more actively involved in raising children."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01300,2022-04-05-T-019,1300,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Other than embracing women as equal partners in the workplace, these shifts need to occur in our homes, too. One focus of the White Paper is on caregiving, as many of my colleagues have spoken about."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01301,2022-04-05-T-019,1301,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As noted last year, there are approximately 210,000 caregivers in Singapore, most of whom are women aged 40 and above."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01302,2022-04-05-T-019,1302,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"During my Meet-the-People Sessions, I have encountered women who told me the difficulties in securing migrant domestic workers' help during COVID-19 meant that they, as mothers, wives, sisters, aunties and daughters, had to make the tough choice to leave their jobs to ensure an elderly parent or child is looked after, while it was not even in the realm of contemplation that their brothers or husbands would do it instead. Many mothers also shared how the expectation always fell to them to take emergency leave in the case of an ill child. Emotional labour aside, caregiver's income decreases by 63% on average, reducing their ability to save for retirement."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01303,2022-04-05-T-019,1303,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,I applaud the proposal to enhance the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) which will now provide up to $400 in relief per month. At the same time. I believe there is room for the scheme to be expanded to better reflect the true value of unpaid caregiving.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01304,2022-04-05-T-019,1304,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In Hawaii, for example, the government grants up to US$70 a day to unpaid primary caregivers of senior relatives to alleviate caregiving burdens. As Singapore's population ages and care burdens increase, such models may be examined further, including how we may potentially finance them."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01305,2022-04-05-T-019,1305,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I hope that the criteria which a care recipient of the HCG must meet can be expanded as well, as some seniors fall just shy of the three ADL criteria, but face other serious challenges that require dedicated care and similar expenses. I also look forward to hearing more about how the Household Services Scheme can be broadened and make more accessible in a timely manner to meet demand."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01306,2022-04-05-T-019,1306,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Who will care for our caregivers in their old age, those who have given up hopes and dreams of their own, once the care recipients are no longer around?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01307,2022-04-05-T-019,1307,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,I am glad to hear the efforts elaborated by Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam earlier on this front.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01308,2022-04-05-T-019,1308,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I would like to briefly touch on a point that is close to the hearts of many women in my generation on setting up a home. When you get to your 20s, you are asked at every festive season, wedding and funeral, ""When are you getting married?"" After you get married, you are asked, ""When are you having children?"" When you have one child, you are asked, ""Why are you stopping at one?"" And when you have many children, you are asked, ""Why do you have so many?"""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01309,2022-04-05-T-019,1309,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"But it is not always within the control of the woman and such comments can be very hurtful reminders of what they hope for, but have not come true. I hope that society can consider for women who remain single because of personal decisions; women who have made a tough choice to leave relationships; women who cannot have kids because of infertility challenges either of their own or of their partner; or women who need to focus on careers because they are the only child who can look after their parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01310,2022-04-05-T-019,1310,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I hope that in considering what can make a woman whole, we look at who she is and not just who she could be relative to someone else, like a wife or a mother. I hope we can, in the words of Minister Ong Ye Kung earlier, consider the unconscious remarks that we make."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01311,2022-04-05-T-019,1311,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"On this note, I appreciate the steps we are taking on elective egg freezing. With this, women can have the time and space to make choices instead of rushing headlong into starting a family. This benefits not only them but the children they may welcome into their lives in a planned, responsible manner."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01312,2022-04-05-T-019,1312,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As a Member of this House who is a woman under 35 years old, it is something my peers and I have often discussed and I know that there are women slightly older who wish that they have this option, too. This is a topic that has prompted much discussion, and I hope that we can continue to have these important conversations in a way that is mindful of different beliefs and, ultimately, for greater progress."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01313,2022-04-05-T-019,1313,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"With FWAs, leadership cultivation, this White Paper proposes actions that benefit many white-collar working women. However, any discussion on gender equality is incomplete without considering the experiences of women from lower-income backgrounds. With limited resources, it can be all the more difficult for these women to have a voice and a choice despite their courage and best efforts."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01314,2022-04-05-T-019,1314,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The proposed solution for lower-income women we often hear is, ""Why don't you get a job?"" Well, many jobs have irregular hours due to overtime while most childcare services have fixed daytime hours, making it more difficult to viably care for children without additional expenses. And although childcare subsidies do exist, the burden of proving the work hours falls onto them, and sometimes are difficult to substantiate, especially for self-employed mothers. For some families, work may, inevitably, reduce ComCare or increased HDB rental fees, such that they are in a financially worse position than should she stay at home."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01315,2022-04-05-T-019,1315,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I am happy to hear that KidSTART and flexible childminding support will be expanded. Yet, these women face other barriers like aspirational poverty or lower social capital. As ComLink scales up, I hope that there can also be better integrated programmes catered for women to achieve personal growth and empowerment beyond family and child-centric efforts."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01316,2022-04-05-T-019,1316,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Additionally, specific groups of women need more support. In this House, I have called for more to be done for families of offenders. Generally, there are 10 times more men than women in our penal population. For many male offenders in prison, they leave behind wives, sisters, mothers, daughters outside to wait and face the world. We must reach out more proactively to these women and their families to provide support from the point of incarceration to release and reintegration and not leave this assistance to chanced house visits by our teams on the ground or relying on referral pathways in the male offenders' hands. Such initiatives could make a world of difference to the women whose struggles and aspirations may otherwise be overlooked."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01317,2022-04-05-T-019,1317,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I recently chatted with two young women who co-founded their first business. They have worked with large tech companies, both in Singapore and overseas, and shared with me some responses they got when they introduced themselves as minority women founders, identifiers that they were proud of. One response was, ""Why do you victimise yourself that way?"" The double-barrelled identifiers by race and gender were somewhat affronting to some people. But why should minority and women mean victim, or less than? Why should not minority and women mean strong and capable? Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01318,2022-04-05-T-019,1318,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In my speech earlier, I touched on how Singapore, since long ago, has taken steps and provided opportunities for women to achieve our aspirations. The White Paper on Singapore Women’s Development shows the Government's commitment to take firm action to support women in fulfilling our aspirations. However, I hope we will not just depend on laws."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01319,2022-04-05-T-019,1319,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As a society, we should also play a role. Recently, we have seen an incident where misogynistic comments or a list that sexualised our religious teachers have degraded our women. The community came together to condemn such acts, and incidents like this have encouraged more discussions on the importance of respecting and upholding the dignity of our women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01320,2022-04-05-T-019,1320,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Have we changed how we see the role of our mothers, older sisters, younger sisters, or wives at home? A recent study by the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS) highlighted a concern faced by Singapore Malay women. They face a dilemma of balancing their aspirations at work and at home. The study also hoped that more efforts can be implemented to overcome negative stereotypes that could further complicate the efforts of our Malay women in climbing the ladder of success."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01321,2022-04-05-T-019,1321,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"It is my hope that more Malay/Muslim women are given the opportunity to hold positions as company chiefs and leaders of community organisations. In doing so, it will allow women to have bigger dreams so that other women, particularly our young, will dare to try and achieve the aspirations that they hope for."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01322,2022-04-05-T-019,1322,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In English)  Our position on Singapore Women's Development is for all of us. The policies in this White Paper do not grant women opportunities and rights at the expense of men. They seek to improve on our current system – a society in which all contributions are recognised and respected. In this Singapore, men and women can play to their strengths without labels. In my own generation, I see how equitable access to opportunities have catapulted women into lives that our mothers and grandmothers could only dream of."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01323,2022-04-05-T-019,1323,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I know that all of us in this House, men and women Parliamentarians alike, will work even harder such that Singapore will be fairer and more inclusive for the generations of young women to come. To our dear girls, ""Don't let anyone or anything hold you back."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01324,2022-04-05-T-019,1324,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the White Paper and look forward to the collective action that we will take as a society together."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01325,2022-04-05-T-019,1325,Deputy Speaker,Ms Ng Ling Ling.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01326,2022-04-05-T-019,1326,Ng Ling Ling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, visually- and hearing-impaired author and advocate Helen Keller famously shared this quote about women's progress in 1904. I quote, ""I think the degree of a nation's civilisation may be measured by the degree of enlightenment of its people, of its women""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01327,2022-04-05-T-019,1327,Ng Ling Ling,"Women today are no longer confined to the traditional role of homemakers alone. Over the years, women in Singapore, including myself, have benefited greatly from the meritocratic system with equal educational opportunities for all and become contributors to nation-building and social progress through our own inspiration and self-determining efforts. It is thus very encouraging for me to know that the Government is putting forth wide-ranging action plans to advance Singapore women's development, with the vision of creating an inclusive and fairer society for all."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01328,2022-04-05-T-019,1328,Ng Ling Ling,"Having been part of the consultation process, I am glad that the White Paper has captured the Government's action plans to enhance support, especially in two areas  one, equal opportunities at the workplace; and two, recognition and support for caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01329,2022-04-05-T-019,1329,Ng Ling Ling,My speech will focus on some suggestions that could further enhance the actions to be taken in these two areas.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01330,2022-04-05-T-019,1330,Ng Ling Ling,"Firstly, I am encouraged that the Government will be developing career mentorship, network opportunities and training programmes for women at work and those re-entering the workforce."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01331,2022-04-05-T-019,1331,Ng Ling Ling,"I believe that mentorship is an excellent way to support women who intend to pursue career advancement, professional development or wish to return to the workforce. I have been providing mentorship to younger women for several years and it has been most satisfying to see these women grow in their careers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01332,2022-04-05-T-019,1332,Ng Ling Ling,"To facilitate more of these mentoring efforts, I would like to suggest for agencies, such as Workforce Singapore and NTUC, to provide a common platform or a one-stop portal that offers resources and information on job-matching opportunities, transition training programmes as well as an available pool of mentors that women at work or re-entering the workforce can connect to."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01333,2022-04-05-T-019,1333,Ng Ling Ling,Social platforms can allow those who are willing to be mentors to be matched with women who are seeking mentorship. This will be especially helpful for women who have been stay-home caregivers for many years and require support transitioning back to the workforce.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01334,2022-04-05-T-019,1334,Ng Ling Ling,"I am glad to share that, in partnership with fellow hon Member Yeo Wan Ling and NTUC Women and Family Unit, my constituency in Jalan Kayu will be implementing a women-mentoring-women programme to support such efforts."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01335,2022-04-05-T-019,1335,Ng Ling Ling,"Secondly, I am heartened by the recommendations to enhance caregiver support proposed in the White Paper. I have spoken about the need to enhance caregiver support in my 2021 Budget speech and I believe that action plans in the White Paper to enhance respite care options for caregivers and Home Caregiving Grant will, indeed, be welcome measures to alleviate the caregiving load."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01336,2022-04-05-T-019,1336,Ng Ling Ling,"Besides the action plans proposed for caregivers' support, I would like to call for further support for caregivers of seniors by having the Agency for Integrated Care actively promote advanced care planning, especially at the early stage of caring for their senior loved ones. This is so that the caregivers can alleviate their concerns of what would be the most appropriate care to carry out, without being burdened or feeling guilty whether the right care was given to their loved ones."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01337,2022-04-05-T-019,1337,Ng Ling Ling,"Additionally, I understand that the current MediSave Care Scheme allows individuals with severe disabilities or their spouses to withdraw up to $200 monthly, with the cap of $2,400 per year to supplement long-term care needs."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01338,2022-04-05-T-019,1338,Ng Ling Ling,"I would like to suggest that the MediSave Care Scheme be extended to senior caregivers above 65 years old that have adult children with severe disability to tap into their MediSave to support the care of their loved ones at home or in adult disability homes. This will likely help to ease their financial burdens to support the long-term care needs of their children when they become incapable of giving care to their adult children themselves. Mdm Deputy Speaker, please allow me to say a few words in Mandarin."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01339,2022-04-05-T-019,1339,Ng Ling Ling,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Deputy Speaker, since our Independence in 1965, the role of Singapore women has gradually evolved from family-centred homemakers to career women in the modern era, making substantial contributions to our country and society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01340,2022-04-05-T-019,1340,Ng Ling Ling,I fully support the White Paper on Singapore women’s development. The White Paper will help uplift Singapore women's status and lay the foundation for their development in the future towards a fairer and more inclusive society.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01341,2022-04-05-T-019,1341,Ng Ling Ling,"In particular, I support the action plans in two areas in the White Paper. First, equal opportunities in the workplace; second, support for caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01342,2022-04-05-T-019,1342,Ng Ling Ling,"First, I am encouraged that the Government will be developing career mentorship and training programmes for women at work and those re-entering the workforce. I have been providing mentorship to younger women and it has been most satisfying to see them grow and succeed in their careers. Therefore, I hope that the Government can provide a one-stop portal that can match women at work and those re-entering the workforce with a suitable mentor who can help them open a window of opportunity and fulfil their career aspirations."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01343,2022-04-05-T-019,1343,Ng Ling Ling,"Second, I am heartened by the recommendations to enhance female caregiver support proposed in the White Paper, such as the enhanced Home Caregiving Grant and respite services to lighten the financial and mental burden of caregivers. I hope that the Government can also pay attention to caregivers of seniors, by having the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) actively promote advanced care planning, so that seniors can ponder and plan in advance their personal care arrangement in later years. By doing this, caregivers would know what the most appropriate medical treatment and care will be, based on the seniors’ own choice, without being mentally burdened or feeling guilty."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01344,2022-04-05-T-019,1344,Ng Ling Ling,"Lastly, uplifting the social status of women requires the collaborative efforts and support from both genders. Therefore, a mindset change is crucial. To collectively build a society where men and women are equals and all can pursue their dreams freely and fully, we need our fathers, brothers, husbands and sons to give their unwavering support and close partnership. May this partnership continue to enable Singapore to become a fairer, more inclusive and united country."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01345,2022-04-05-T-019,1345,Ng Ling Ling,"(In English)  Mdm Deputy Speaker, embarking on this endeavour to advance Singapore women's development is a partnership between both men and women. As the Conversations on Singapore Women's Development have rightly identified, mindset shifts in our society remain the foundational factor undergirding the progress of women in Singapore. While it is difficult to see the effectiveness of mindset shifts in the short term, it is the most needed to materialise in all the areas that we are pursuing."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01346,2022-04-05-T-019,1346,Ng Ling Ling,"I believe that the mindset shift towards empowering women need not be seen as a zero-sum game where the rights of one gender have to be compromised over the other and men are supposed to give something up. Rather, it is the empowerment of women to progress in society as a whole where they reach their fullest potential to become active contributors to realising a fairer and more inclusive society for all Singaporeans."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01347,2022-04-05-T-019,1347,Ng Ling Ling,"Thus, in order to fully appreciate the progress of women in Singapore, in our society, we need to also consider the immense support and understanding that our fathers, brothers, husbands and sons have been giving to us in this enduring partnership in women's development. May this partnership continue to flourish so that we, as a nation, can achieve greater heights together."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01348,2022-04-05-T-019,1348,Ng Ling Ling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my consideration raised, I support the White Paper on women's development."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01349,2022-04-05-T-019,1349,Deputy Speaker,Mr Seah Kian Peng.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01350,2022-04-05-T-019,1350,Seah Kian Peng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, this White Paper holds many promises for women and, through that, promises for a better Singapore. We become better when women are more equal."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01351,2022-04-05-T-019,1351,Seah Kian Peng,"Although many of the recommendations in this White Paper will make our job market more attractive, our economy more competitive, our long-term growth more sustainable, none of these justifies our adopting the recommendations. That women should have an equal place in society is right in itself, not because it promotes some other social good."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01352,2022-04-05-T-019,1352,Seah Kian Peng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, our journey towards equality has not been an easy one, with fits and starts and, sometimes, we become stuck for a long time. This poem ""Mother and Son"" written by Langston Hughes, a famous African-American poet, describes the process well. It goes like this."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01353,2022-04-05-T-019,1353,Seah Kian Peng,"""Well, son, I'll tell you"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01354,2022-04-05-T-019,1354,Seah Kian Peng,Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01355,2022-04-05-T-019,1355,Seah Kian Peng,"It's had tacks in it,"

2022-04-05-T-019-S-01360,2022-04-05-T-019,1360,Seah Kian Peng,"But all the time,"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01361,2022-04-05-T-019,1361,Seah Kian Peng,"I's been a-climbin' on."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01362,2022-04-05-T-019,1362,Seah Kian Peng,"For many women today, life is no ""crystal stair"" and, today, when we see girls and boys in school and safe streets at night, there remains ""tacks and splinters""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01363,2022-04-05-T-019,1363,Seah Kian Peng,"Today, there remains a wage difference between men and women. Caregiving falls most heavily on women. More women are likely to be harassed sexually and there are far fewer women than men on boards of companies."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01364,2022-04-05-T-019,1364,Seah Kian Peng,"In our words and in our deeds, there remain many injustices and biases in society. One White Paper and one Motion does not make a crystal stair but it is a step up."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01365,2022-04-05-T-019,1365,Seah Kian Peng,"Over the years, there have been many such step ups, leading to the more equal landscape that we see today."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01366,2022-04-05-T-019,1366,Seah Kian Peng,"For example, the discrepancy in Singapore's adjusted gender pay gap. This has decreased from 8.8% in 2002 to 4.3% in 2020. We have halved this in 20 years. There is still a gap and the narrowing is slow. But we have made progress."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01367,2022-04-05-T-019,1367,Seah Kian Peng,I would like to just speak on two points  equality in the workplace and on social norms.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01368,2022-04-05-T-019,1368,Seah Kian Peng,"Earlier this year, I spoke on the issue of support for mothers who may be unemployed during divorce. I also asked about support for parents with caregiving responsibilities, including greater flexible work support and other policies for better work-life harmony. For the past 15 years, I have also spoken on the need to support single mothers as part of a broader commitment to single parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01369,2022-04-05-T-019,1369,Seah Kian Peng,"In all these policies, I have often wondered about the lines that are drawn. For example, do we draw a line between the home and the workplace? When we give more support to women as caregivers at home, are we making them better workers and colleagues? Another example, do we support single mothers or all single parents? Do we support just mothers who are unemployed or do we do so for fathers, too, during divorce?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01370,2022-04-05-T-019,1370,Seah Kian Peng,"When we say ""regardless of gender"", do we mean we treat men and women the same? Is that not the right thing to do?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01371,2022-04-05-T-019,1371,Seah Kian Peng,"Well, yes and no. Some answers are easy. For example, we support single parents whether they are men or women. We support all persons who require help during their search for employment regardless of gender."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01372,2022-04-05-T-019,1372,Seah Kian Peng,"For example, for NTUC FairPrice, our commitment in developing a wonderful workplace is anchored on our human resource practices, which adhere to the principle of equality and equal employment opportunity. We employ on the basis of merit and adopt a non-discriminatory stance on race, religion, gender or age."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01373,2022-04-05-T-019,1373,Seah Kian Peng,"The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices require us to provide employment opportunities to all, including part-timers and flexi-timers. Many of these are women who juggle between home and work."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01374,2022-04-05-T-019,1374,Seah Kian Peng,"But in so doing, we make no judgement on whether it should be women or men who do this juggling. In the same way, all staff are also entitled to childcare leave and child sick leave. We have ""family charity leave"", which allows both men and women to either celebrate auspicious occasions with their family or to do charity work and bond with their loved ones."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01375,2022-04-05-T-019,1375,Seah Kian Peng,"We aim to ensure they are provided with not only competitive remuneration but also a safe and caring environment, a culture of continuous learning and a roadmap for career development so that every employee has the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01376,2022-04-05-T-019,1376,Seah Kian Peng,"In that case, equality is the result of treating people the same. But in some cases, equality requires us also to treat women differently."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01377,2022-04-05-T-019,1377,Seah Kian Peng,"In Singapore, SMEs employ about 70% of the workforce and there are more than a quarter million of these companies."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01378,2022-04-05-T-019,1378,Seah Kian Peng,"According to a survey by NTUC and PAP Women's Wing, 23% of respondents believe there is gender discrimination in the workplace. More women felt they had been passed over for promotion or career advancement, that their companies favour men when hiring. They felt treated unfairly but they were afraid to report it to their management."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01379,2022-04-05-T-019,1379,Seah Kian Peng,"Clearly, equality here requires us to pay greater attention to providing equal respect for our colleagues who are women. Earlier this year, some SMEs have signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with NTUC, which will provide consultants and resources when they set up policies, such as on proper grievance handling procedures and disciplinary actions."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01380,2022-04-05-T-019,1380,Seah Kian Peng,"The road to greater equality requires us not just to treat women like men, but to pay attention to the unfairness that exists today between them. The workplace is one of the most important spaces where such equality can be observed, can be measured and can be improved."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01381,2022-04-05-T-019,1381,Seah Kian Peng,"Within the NTUC Enterprise group that I work at, I am proud that, in our leadership team, about half of them are women. The female representation on our board of directors is about 34%, already exceeding the targeted minimum guidelines that the Singapore Institute of Directors is advocating for all boards. We need to further improve on this."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01382,2022-04-05-T-019,1382,Seah Kian Peng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the next part of my speech is a little harder to measure and quantify. It has to do with the way we think, speak about and to women. How many times have we interrupted women as they speak, explain to them matters which they already know – sometimes better than us? Maybe, most times, better than us. How many of us do this to women more than men? How is this okay?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01383,2022-04-05-T-019,1383,Seah Kian Peng,"""Mansplaining"" – in fact, Minister Ong Ye Kung also referred to it – is so common that there is a name for it, but this has not made it less frequent. We must not only refrain from openly disrespectful behaviour, such as those that I have listed above, but also patronising ones. For example, I am sure all of us would have – well, I certainly have – experienced some senior corporate leaders, including senior civil servants, thank a male emcee by name and the female emcee by referring to her as ""the beautiful young lady""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01384,2022-04-05-T-019,1384,Seah Kian Peng,"In a recent article in the newspaper – in fact, just slightly more than a week ago – a male editor wrote, ""Frankly, many women prefer generous husbands and would think poorly of partners who expect them to share household expenses equally like how some couples split dining bills when they are dating."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01385,2022-04-05-T-019,1385,Seah Kian Peng,"This is truly astonishing. There is a temptation to brush these off, not to take offence too easily. But we should pause and think if such asymmetry is something that we should be proud of."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01386,2022-04-05-T-019,1386,Seah Kian Peng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, social norms are set by all of us, men and women. We become a better society when women are more equal. That women should have an equal place in society is right in itself. So, let us keep climbing and working together. Enough with the talking and let us put all these into practice. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion wholeheartedly."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01387,2022-04-05-T-019,1387,Deputy Speaker,Miss Rachel Ong.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01388,2022-04-05-T-019,1388,Rachel Ong,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my speech will focus on our single women who serve as informal caregivers for our seniors, their challenges and how we can show up meaningfully for them."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01389,2022-04-05-T-019,1389,Rachel Ong,"In conversations with single women caregivers, a major challenge shared is their retirement inadequacy. This stems from three sources."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01390,2022-04-05-T-019,1390,Rachel Ong,"First, reduced unpaid work. Caregivers face difficulties holding down a full-time job while still providing care for the seniors, especially in households where the load of caregiving falls entirely on one person."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01391,2022-04-05-T-019,1391,Rachel Ong,"Duke NUS and MSF surveys illustrate that caregivers spend an average of 36 to 38 hours a week on caregiving, depending on the level of needs. Almost half of the caregivers surveyed do not hold a job and of those who do, 26% of them had their work affected by caregiving. Those interviewed in AWARE's 2019 survey either cut down work hours or stopped work altogether."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01392,2022-04-05-T-019,1392,Rachel Ong,"These work changes negatively impact the caregiver's own retirement adequacy as CPF contributions are stopped or reduced. Given that most caregivers are 45 to 59 years old, an age where they could be economically productive and be able to save up for retirement, the financial impact is significant."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01393,2022-04-05-T-019,1393,Rachel Ong,"Second, lower overall income of women. The negative impact on retirement savings is compounded by the fact that women also, generally, earn less than men in their working life. The 2018 MOM statistics also showed that women greatly outnumbered men in not being able to hit the CPF Basic Retirement Sum at age 55 and, at the same time, have a longer life expectancy."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01394,2022-04-05-T-019,1394,Rachel Ong,"Third, home ownership policies. One of the ways Singapore enhances old age income security is through the home ownership programme. In their senior years, married couples have the option of downgrading their HDB flats for a retirement income. However, this is not an option for singles, who are already limited to buying higher priced resale or 2-room BTOs in non-mature estates or in prime locations. In short, singles, specifically women, expend their financial resources on care for their parents and face financial challenges in their later years for their own care, with little to, at times, no family support."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01395,2022-04-05-T-019,1395,Rachel Ong,May I make four suggestions to mitigate the negative financial impact on single women caregivers.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01396,2022-04-05-T-019,1396,Rachel Ong,"First, top-up of CPF from family members to caregivers. The Government could consider supplementing caregiver CPF contributions from the care recipient parents' CPF. For those who qualify for MediSave care, care recipients can be given the option for the monthly cash amounts to be transferred to the caregiver's CPF instead of their bank account. This can be done where children have been ascertained to be caregivers of a specific parent, to receive a monthly transfer from the latter."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01397,2022-04-05-T-019,1397,Rachel Ong,"There could also be an option for siblings who have met the Basic Retirement Sum to top-up their caregiving sibling's CPF, incentivised with an enhanced caregiver's support tax relief beyond current amounts for the contributions made, or complemented with greater subsidies for the parents' caregiver's services."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01398,2022-04-05-T-019,1398,Rachel Ong,"The second suggestion  healthcare subsidies based solely on household income. Having understood the concerns of some of my residents, I would like to propose a consideration for MOH relating to care recipients staying in properties of annual value (AV) $13,000 and above. In MOH's current means-testing approach, even if the household income qualifies the recipient for subsidy, but the care recipient stays in a private estate where AV is very likely to be above $13,000, no subsidy will be given to him or her. The rationale behind this is that if the senior sells their private property and moves to an HDB unit, they then should have sufficient income for healthcare costs. However, this means that the senior would then, in their old age and ill-health, have to move in and adapt to a new environment, possibly away from the environment of the people they are familiar with."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01399,2022-04-05-T-019,1399,Rachel Ong,"In addition to ongoing caregiver responsibilities, the single caregiver will have to figure out the sale, search and purchase of a home and make arrangements for the move. These stresses add on to the stress of change in health and care needed both for the caregiver and recipient. If access to subsidies requires seniors to move their homes in order for caregivers to access subsidies, it will also go against the grain of encouraging ageing-in-place. For care recipients with property AV of beyond $13,000, when the care recipient no longer needs to stay in the property, proceeds from the sale or rental of property could then be returned to the Government, as part of the agreement to receive subsidised care. This will help alleviate the immediate financial burdens of caregivers, ensure that the Government's subsidies are sustainable, while truly supporting seniors to age-in-place."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01400,2022-04-05-T-019,1400,Rachel Ong,"The third suggestion  workplace support for single caregivers. Childcare leave should be converted to a more general family care leave, to include those who are caregivers of parents, particularly single caregivers who have limited help. The number of family care leaves for such singles should be mandated by law, instead of simply encouraging employers to provide for it. While FWAs have been raised as a viable alternative, mandatory family care leave can still be added to complement FWAs, in the same way that parents are still entitled to take childcare leave, even when on FWAs. Extended family care leave should also be considered for those who have parents with dementia or conditions that require greater support."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01401,2022-04-05-T-019,1401,Rachel Ong,"The fourth suggestion  compensating and recognising caregivers. I am encouraged to hear that the Home Care Giving (HCG) grant will be further enhanced. I believe we can still take a greater stride to support caregivers, given their significant loss of income, by providing a calibrated monthly caregiving allowance with CPF contributions for those who have reduced work, or stopped work to be caregivers. Caregiving involves many out-of-pocket expenses, from medical supplements to transportation for medical appointments, to medical and mobility aids. These costs are even more significant for those who are disqualified from subsidies due to the AV of the care recipients' property."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01402,2022-04-05-T-019,1402,Rachel Ong,"Caregiving allowance is not meant to be an income replacement, but an allowance to support these out-of-pocket care expenses in caregiving and also basic personal subsistence, without disincentivising work. Instead of hiring MDWs for the work of caregiving, if children choose to give of their time and effort to do so, our policies should encourage it. Various OECD countries have formulated ways in which caregivers can be compensated, whether via allowances or care recipient benefits, which we can study to formulate one suitable and sustainable for Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01403,2022-04-05-T-019,1403,Rachel Ong,"The dedication of our singles to care for our seniors should be recognised and advanced in tangible ways, with policies that facilitate building a retirement safety net for them. I look forward to sustainable changes the Government would make to better support our single women caregivers financially, both in the immediate and long term. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01404,2022-04-05-T-019,1404,Deputy Speaker,Ms Carrie Tan.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01405,2022-04-05-T-019,1405,Carrie Tan,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would, first, like to thank all Ministries and staff, everyone who has worked very hard on this White Paper, distilling the many diverse voices into these recommendations throughout the past year, even though the pandemic has brought challenges. It is very needed momentum towards women's equality. I would like to offer three more points today for practical consideration and, later on, I would also like to address something that has come up in the course of today's debate."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01406,2022-04-05-T-019,1406,Carrie Tan,"One, work and housing security for low-income women; two, enabling workplace fairness and equality; and three, ensuring sustainable distribution of care."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01407,2022-04-05-T-019,1407,Carrie Tan,"While I welcome the recommendations in the White Paper to enable more women on boards and mentorship opportunities and PMET jobs, we need to pay special attention to lower-income women who struggle to access stable employment in the first place. And I believe, we can do more to improve work accessibility for them as a society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01408,2022-04-05-T-019,1408,Carrie Tan,"Non-PMET workers have lower incomes and lesser financial resources to outsource their care needs. For example, most cannot afford to hire domestic help. We should provide them with more support to help them reduce work-care conflict. Although I am happy that the Government would be extending the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to more sectors, we need to make sure that these higher wages are not met with strategies by businesses to cut corners on the welfare of workers, which will have a very detrimental impact on low-income women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01409,2022-04-05-T-019,1409,Carrie Tan,"We can incentivise businesses to adopt innovative work allocation strategies, primarily targeted at the low-wage job sectors. This could be flexi-hours, flexi-shift, shift-swapping, compressed work weeks, core and stable scheduling, to name some examples. Now, what is core and stable scheduling? Daughters Of Tomorrow, or DOT, has advocated since 2018 for employers to take up core and stable scheduling. What it means is that managers give employees their preferred shift to accommodate their care duties at home. And since DOT started enrolling employer partners in 2018, 126 companies have adopted this model successfully, where single mothers have managed to plan their daily routines more efficiently, reducing work-care conflicts, when they do not have to juggle multiple different shifts within the same week."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01410,2022-04-05-T-019,1410,Carrie Tan,"To enable companies to adopt core and stable scheduling, perhaps the Government can consider giving wage top-ups to workers who may not have as many care responsibilities at home to take the shifts during periods when home care is most needed, usually these are the evenings and the weekends. Such a scheme could be called ""Work-Care Grants"" and some may argue that the higher hourly wages could cause these evening and weekend shifts to, in turn, become more popular instead."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01411,2022-04-05-T-019,1411,Carrie Tan,"However, similar experiments of the international retailer Gap have shown that mothers with care responsibilities preferred to forego the marginally higher hourly wage, in favour of being able to be at home during care hours for the children."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01412,2022-04-05-T-019,1412,Carrie Tan,"In addition to stable shifts at work, lower-income women need better housing security. I hope the Government will look seriously into communal housing for single mothers and extended rental subsidies for vulnerable families which are striving their utmost towards social mobility."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01413,2022-04-05-T-019,1413,Carrie Tan,"Single mothers in shelters face massive anxiety from being told that they can only stay for six months. Shelters have to use this approach currently to ensure adequate capacity. Those who are in rental flats face similar uncertainties when weighing income opportunities against loss of rental subsidies when their salary increases. Many residents from public rental flats who sought my assistance after they have employment requested for reduction in housing rental. After securing a job and income, many want to clear their arrears or other debts that they may be owing to friends and family."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01414,2022-04-05-T-019,1414,Carrie Tan,"It is not uncommon for single mothers living in rental flats that Daughter Of Tomorrow, or DOT, works with to turn down promotions from their employers so that they will stay within the salary band for the existing rental rate. Doing well at work, ironically, becomes a disincentive. It holds back the progress of lower-income women that we want to see the most."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01415,2022-04-05-T-019,1415,Carrie Tan,We already know that the average length of stay in rental flats before families move out into their own homes is seven years. Reducing financial shocks during this period and helping the families to build buffers are critical for successful emergence from poverty.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01416,2022-04-05-T-019,1416,Carrie Tan,"An automatic 12-month grace period before adjusting rent in public rental flats, post-employment, will help these families greatly. I urge the Government to relook at the income criteria model for rental housing provision."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01417,2022-04-05-T-019,1417,Carrie Tan,"We must also, at the same time, explore more stable and sustainable alternatives, such as communal housing, in the long term."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01418,2022-04-05-T-019,1418,Carrie Tan,"While at DOT, I collaborated with AWARE's SHE Project, which provides two years of communal housing for two to three low-income single mothers and their children. They offered peer support to each other and pooled resources for domestic and childcare needs, which helped them retain their jobs and build up their financial resources. SHE Project showed that mothers with longer-term housing stability were better able to rebuild a path towards financial independence. This model is already in use in the US and Japan. We can study their experiences to create a model that works for Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01419,2022-04-05-T-019,1419,Carrie Tan,"Second, regarding workplace equality, I urge the Government to enable SMEs to build more progressive workplace cultures by supporting them in the culture and operational transformation journey. The call for non-discriminatory hiring practices needs to come hand-in-hand with equipping SMEs better. Larger companies and MNCs often have sufficient resources and services to help them address harassment and discrimination, but many SMEs might not, and they have very real operational challenges."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01420,2022-04-05-T-019,1420,Carrie Tan,"I recommend that the Government provide subsidies for training on such matters, or for “diversity and inclusion” coaches to support SMEs in their culture transition. These do not need to cost much. For example, in February, I moderated a panel discussion at NTUC, together with TAFEP, where HR and business owners from SMEs gathered and came to hear about ways they can better tackle workplace discrimination and grievances. The attendees who came found it helpful and they saw that grievance handling does not necessarily have to end up in lawsuits or firing someone but could be opportunities for education within their companies."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01421,2022-04-05-T-019,1421,Carrie Tan,We talked about the possibilities of harnessing the energies of their own employee community to advance this cause without incurring high expenses as a form of internal corporate social responsibility. The Government can help rally business associations to do more of such sharing sessions with NTUC and TAFEP to facilitate best practices and capacity-building amongst SMEs.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01422,2022-04-05-T-019,1422,Carrie Tan,"Finally, the White Paper suggests some efforts to encourage men to take their paternity and parental leave. There is still stigma around men spending time away from work to take care of family. Men shared with me their concerns that taking time off from work for care obligations could compromise their chances at promotions or create a negative impression of them at work. One key strategy to change this mindset is to ungender care and normalise care work for both men and women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01423,2022-04-05-T-019,1423,Carrie Tan,"We need to create mindset shifts upstream. One way is to expand the scope of National Service to include care vocations, enlisting both young men and women. We can deploy young people based on their aptitude in either the armed forces or the care forces. Those who are physically unsuitable for the armed forces can be deployed to care roles in the community, such as respite caregiving, care coordinators, medical escorts, befrienders, mental health responders and so on, while those with the desire and physical aptitude can opt or be deployed to military positions."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01424,2022-04-05-T-019,1424,Carrie Tan,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many families' caregiving needs increased. Many citizens had to quit their jobs to care for the young and old at home. Including care vocations in National Service (NS) to support the community with their caregiving needs will help reduce the stress of our people and our workforce and, more critically, for care work to be seen as a shared civic responsibility in a nation with a rapidly ageing population, in an un-gendered manner."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01425,2022-04-05-T-019,1425,Carrie Tan,"This is not a novel concept. In Switzerland, men can choose to do civilian service instead of military service, serving in healthcare, welfare, environmental protection, research projects or development assistance abroad. If compulsory enlistment is too big a step for now, we can introduce CCAs in schools in the likes of National Cadet Corps or National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, perhaps called the National Care Corps for both boys and girls. This will help to socialise young people from a young age to see women as equals and themselves as caregivers, giving them exposure to care work as a meaningful vocation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01426,2022-04-05-T-019,1426,Carrie Tan,"De-conflicting work and care is the urgent priority to advance women. When men and society take some care burdens from the shoulders of women, women can have more space on their shoulders for their aspirations and for daughters to stand on. In doing so, we will create role models for both our sons and daughters, for a world that sees true and equal partnership between men and women and on this point about true partnership."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01427,2022-04-05-T-019,1427,Carrie Tan,"True partnership requires recognising and affirming the inherent worth of women in all spheres of life. It requires the eradication of the mindsets and the narratives that create barriers to women's worth being recognised. These narratives have conditioned society so much that, often, women doubt ourselves, we doubt our own worth."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01428,2022-04-05-T-019,1428,Carrie Tan,"When Minister Ong Ye Kung said earlier about the comments that relatives make, an innocuous comment to say ""When are you going to have sons?"" could hurt a girl child very deeply, causing a wound on the perceptions of their self-worth."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01429,2022-04-05-T-019,1429,Carrie Tan,"Because of this, mandated representation, alluded by our hon colleague Assoc Prof Jamus Lim earlier, saying that it is charity that should begin at home, is deeply patronising to women. In a world where innocuous messages are sent constantly to women to make us feel lesser, the last thing that we need is a cloud hanging over our heads, making us wonder and doubt whether we have gotten a position out of our own merit or for anyone else to have that doubt."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01430,2022-04-05-T-019,1430,Carrie Tan,"So, let us focus on doing the real work, the deep work that may not sound very ambitious but is important to help change the values and inherent unquestioned mental models that build these narratives that cast doubts on women's self-worth. We need to build up women's innate confidence and the work that truly eradicates narratives and barriers are the ones that we need to do, so that they no longer stand in the way of women's self-worth and brilliance."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01431,2022-04-05-T-019,1431,Carrie Tan,"Stop making us doubt and stop making us choose. De-conflict our choices so that we truly can have it all. If not for us now, at least in the near future, for our daughters. With that, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I support the Motion. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01432,2022-04-05-T-019,1432,Deputy Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01433,2022-04-05-T-019,1433,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I declare my interest as a board member of Casa Raudha, a crisis shelter for women and children facing family violence here in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01434,2022-04-05-T-019,1434,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I rise in support of the Motion and, in particular, the action areas in the White Paper on increasing protection against violence and online harms."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01435,2022-04-05-T-019,1435,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Ending family violence and preventing online harms require a multi-pronged approach involving many parties. Men – husbands, fathers, brothers, sons – can be advocates and allies for the cause. But men can also be victims of violence or online harms as well. I am thus heartened to see the White Paper involving the feedback of many men and setting out what men can do to make a difference."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01436,2022-04-05-T-019,1436,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"First, we can raise awareness – make it easier to report, make help more accessible and make reporting safer not just for survivors but also for whistle-blowers. Second, we can help change mindsets that violent or misogynistic behaviours have no place in our society. Third, we can rethink the way we tackle family violence and rehabilitation efforts in our community."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01437,2022-04-05-T-019,1437,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"First, raising awareness. Recently, in conjunction with International Women's Day, PAP Women's Wing provided a resource toolkit for activists to assist anyone facing online harms. I was involved in this, together with hon Members Nadia Ahmad Samdin and Hany Soh. Together with DefenceGuild SG, we held talks to raise awareness on online harms."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01438,2022-04-05-T-019,1438,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"DefenceGuild SG is a ground-up initiative of lawyers which I founded, following the incident of the lewd online poll on female religious teachers in the Muslim community. Probono lawyers provide assistance and advice to victims of similar online harms and sexual harassment."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01439,2022-04-05-T-019,1439,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"However, there needs to be protection for whistle-blowers as well. We need people who would either be brave enough or feel safe enough to stand up, speak out and take action against such behaviours, be it in the real world or online."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01440,2022-04-05-T-019,1440,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Besides awareness, we need a network of support and information accessible to those who need it and make it easier and safer for reporting. For example, in Taiwan, crisis shelters sometimes are held in the same building as the police station itself. Late last year, France rolled out an initiative to facilitate the lodging of reports on family violence by survivors from where they have found shelter so that they can be in an environment where they feel safe."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01441,2022-04-05-T-019,1441,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I am grateful that MSF has adopted my suggestion on the hand signal for the ""Break the Silence"" campaign to provide non-verbal cues for family violence reporting. The Government also, in response to my previous Parliamentary Question, will enhance the National Anti-Violence Helpline to include a text messaging service or app, which would allow discrete queries or reporting."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01442,2022-04-05-T-019,1442,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In Australia, such resource websites incorporate a ""clear history"" or a ""quick exit"" button which brings the reader quickly to a nondescript Google page, for instance."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01443,2022-04-05-T-019,1443,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Through such awareness and efforts, we hope we can shift mindsets of our society. Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01444,2022-04-05-T-019,1444,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Last year, Casa Raudha conducted a survey and a discussion between fathers and men at the Keat Hong Community Club to understand the impact of the patriarchal mindset on families and its correlation with family violence. A third of the respondents agreed that having a head of family with a patriarchal mindset can destroy a family’s harmony."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01445,2022-04-05-T-019,1445,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Patriarchal mindset and misogynistic and violent behaviours have no place in our society. A mindset shift to bring about equality should start at home.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01446,2022-04-05-T-019,1446,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, this White Paper is important to everyone. Each of us is a leader of our respective families and able to portray positive traits that can be emulated. When family members help one another, the result is family harmony and prosperity in the community."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01447,2022-04-05-T-019,1447,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  Mdm Deputy Speaker, a change in mindset on family violence requires rethinking a more inclusive approach."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01448,2022-04-05-T-019,1448,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In Australia, Victoria state's initiative called the Orange Door provides access to comprehensive services for those experiencing family violence so that they can feel safe and supported. It also provides services for men who resort to violence so that they themselves can get help."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01449,2022-04-05-T-019,1449,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In Singapore, our Family Violence Service Centres also act like a one-stop centre for assistance and links survivors to other forms of help. However, beyond survivors, we also need to assist men to get the help that they need, be it in parenting, anger management or conflict de-escalation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01450,2022-04-05-T-019,1450,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Hence, I am heartened that the Taskforce on Family Violence has recommended to strengthen the rehabilitation of perpetrators, including mandatory counselling programmes (MCP) and treatment, to reduce the risk of violence recurring."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01451,2022-04-05-T-019,1451,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Such efforts would preserve relationships and the family unit in the longer term. This is better for the family's financial and housing security, too."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01452,2022-04-05-T-019,1452,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Survivors of family violence are more likely to live in interim rental housing upon discharge from crisis shelters. Based on data from Casa Raudha, the number of beneficiaries who went on to live in rental housing upon discharge has gone up from 40% in 2017 to over 70% in 2021."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01453,2022-04-05-T-019,1453,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Further, almost two-thirds of them are still unemployed upon discharge despite training and upskilling efforts. Of those who are employed, about 80% earn less than $2,000 per month. These women face challenges in getting affordable accommodation sometimes to be near their workplace or their children's school. A new way to envision crisis shelter service delivery, perhaps."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01454,2022-04-05-T-019,1454,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I recall, many years ago, when volunteering at Casa Raudha Crisis Shelter, I brought my daughter along. There, she saw many girls her age playing with their mothers. The crisis shelter was nice but secluded. It is gated and, some may say, isolated."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01455,2022-04-05-T-019,1455,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"When I explained to my daughter why the other girls were there, her reply stumped me. She asked, ""They didn't do anything wrong. Why must they be here? Why can't they go home? Why can't the bad people move out instead?"""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01456,2022-04-05-T-019,1456,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Our approach towards family violence has always been to tread carefully with relationships and balance that with the safety of survivors in a confidential setting, mostly away from the public glare."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01457,2022-04-05-T-019,1457,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In the Netherlands, The Orange House, established in 2011, changed this thinking behind crisis shelters. The Orange House, located right in the city centre, provides shelter and care in a safe but open and visible setting within the community. Their motto is ""Not secret, but safe"". Their interventions break with the traditional ""behind closed doors"" approach. It means working with all family members, including, if safety allows it, the ex-spouse or perpetrator. The focus is on the impact of family violence on children and safe parenting."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01458,2022-04-05-T-019,1458,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Perhaps, we can consider a similar, more visible and accessible shelter which will not only be empowering to survivors but also send a strong signal to the rest of society that we stand by them, alongside them. It would also be and must be welcoming to men who are perpetrators themselves but want to seek help."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01459,2022-04-05-T-019,1459,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In conclusion, here in Singapore, we cannot afford to sweep family violence under the carpet. With greater awareness, change of mindset and a whole-of-nation approach, we can end family violence and, with it, online harms from our society. Thus, I am glad that both the White Paper and the Recommendations of the Taskforce on Family Violence are moving towards greater intervention, closer cooperation and rehabilitation efforts amongst all stakeholders."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01460,2022-04-05-T-019,1460,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"There are wounds that do not appear physically, but they hurt more and leave deeper scars. Such is the emotional trauma caused by family violence and online harms."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01461,2022-04-05-T-019,1461,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I support the White Paper and this Motion and the action plans set out by the Government. We must target zero violence and online harms against all. This is our collective effort. Men are not just allies because we are good men, but because we are all meant for good."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01462,2022-04-05-T-019,1462,Deputy Speaker,Ms Janet Ang.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01463,2022-04-05-T-019,1463,Janet Ang,"Thank you for the opportunity to join in this debate. Singapore women's development has come a long way. More than 75% of women are in the workforce, more than 50% of University graduates are women, 30% of parliamentarians are women, 13% of CEOs are women and 20% of directors on boards are women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01464,2022-04-05-T-019,1464,Janet Ang,"Education, coupled with progressive and women-friendly policies and structures put in place over the years, has enabled women in Singapore to enter and excel in the workforce as both employees and business owners, and contribute to our nation’s growth. We stand on the shoulders of Singapore women who were trailblazers of their time and Singapore men who were enlightened and humble to act on the wisdom that women are first among equals alongside themselves."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01465,2022-04-05-T-019,1465,Janet Ang,"Last year, as part of Celebrating SG Women, Singapore Business Federation (SBF) did a research study around the issue of ""Uplifting women in the workforce; Investing in the success of women in Singapore"". The study concluded that in a resource-scarce country like Singapore, it is a business imperative to mobilise all available talents, male or female, in order to achieve more robust, sustainable and balanced long-term economic growth. The paper makes 12 recommendations at the company, ecosystem, national and individual level to help create a more inclusive workforce, advance women empowerment in the workplace and bolster women entrepreneurs. SBF is heartened to see that the industry's views have been taken on board in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01466,2022-04-05-T-019,1466,Janet Ang,"""Women"", as a category, is not a monolithic, homogeneous whole and, hence, policies need to address the experiences of multiple sub-groups, for example, single women, single moms, vulnerable groups of women, women as caregivers, senior women in our ageing society. The White Paper, certainly, reflects this reality and that the Government has listened hard and intently to the challenges and aspirations of our women across generations. Kudos and thank you to everyone involved with the SG Women Conversations and this White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01467,2022-04-05-T-019,1467,Janet Ang,"For my speech, I will focus my discussion primarily on ""Making the Workplace Work Even Better for Women in Singapore"". And I submit to you that if the workplace works for women, it will more than likely work better for men, too. Let me share a case in point. I remember back in the 1990s when IBM Singapore was designing policies that would attract and retain women in IBM. One of the policies was to enable women to go on ""Leave of Absence"" and return to work after the time-out, where they either had to go as trailing spouse to their husbands who went overseas on assignment, or when they had to care for their elderly parents, or when their son or daughter was in PSLE year. While this policy was designed with the women's needs in mind, the first beneficiary was a male colleague. So, there you have it – if you do it right for women, the men will benefit."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01468,2022-04-05-T-019,1468,Janet Ang,"One would ask  ""Why the focus on attracting and retaining women in the workforce?"" There is a strong business imperative underpinning this, as women form a rich talent pool critical to alleviating skill shortages and boosting organisational diversity. As we say in the corporate world, it is a race for talent."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01469,2022-04-05-T-019,1469,Janet Ang,"Mr Speaker, I will discuss the following in my speech which, I believe, are key factors that will contribute to making the workplace work better for women. These are FWAs; managing workplace bullying and discrimination; addressing the great resignation; advancing women in leadership; and balance between family and career."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01470,2022-04-05-T-019,1470,Janet Ang,"First up, FWAs. Employers need to recognise that female employees are, generally, the primary caregivers and face challenges in managing work and personal responsibilities. FWAs can better support their women employees to manage both aspects."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01471,2022-04-05-T-019,1471,Janet Ang,"The Singapore National Employers Federation strongly encourages employers to implement FWAs, regardless of gender, to achieve work-life harmony. SBF has recommended in the report that businesses start by adopting TAFEP's Tripartite Standards for Work-Life Harmony; FWAs; and unpaid leave for unforeseen caregiving needs."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01472,2022-04-05-T-019,1472,Janet Ang,"Before COVID-19, I think FWAs were a little bit of a difficult thing for employers to hear, but COVID-19 has resulted in work from home (WFH) becoming the norm. However, the ""WFH-during-COVID-19"" model is not necessarily the best practice. The design principles of FWAs should address the workplace flexibility that is needed, especially by the women, and, at the same time, ensure that the workplace will facilitate an innovative, productive and inclusive work culture that builds strong teamwork and shared purpose."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01473,2022-04-05-T-019,1473,Janet Ang,"MNCs and LLEs, like Shell, DBS and IBM, have best practice policies that support FWAs, companies can learn from one another's experiences and apply them to their own situations. I will share a few."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01474,2022-04-05-T-019,1474,Janet Ang,"Petrine Puah shares with me that at Shell, they encourage flexibility in how, where and when employees work. In addition, employees are also encouraged to step outside of purely work boundaries to participate in other areas of interest, such as social responsibility projects and employee interest groups, for example, time-off for sporting or volunteering. At Shell, there is also a general perception that a career in the energy sector is not suited for women, or shall we say Shell recognises that there is such a perception. So, at Shell, they provide their female employees with training to overcome biases that they may face in a largely male-dominated industry. Today, they have many stories of how women colleagues at Shell break the biases. In Shell Singapore, 39% of their senior leaders based in Singapore are female and 37% of middle-management positions are held by females."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01475,2022-04-05-T-019,1475,Janet Ang,"DBS Bank believes that FWAs are a key element to attract the best people to the bank. Yan Hong of DBS shares with me that they provide a range of FWAs which include ""flexi hours"", ""flexi place"" and 100% ""work-from-home"" for six months for new parents with young children or those with caregiving responsibilities at home. DBS also launched a job-sharing programme where one role can be shared by two employees, giving their employees time to manage family responsibilities. The bank recognises that FWAs require change management for managers and has launched a new manager learning module to support managers to more effectively manage and lead teams in remote or hybrid work settings. DBS' diversity matrix is also very encouraging, with women representing 49% of the workforce, 40% of SVPs, 29% of senior leadership and 20% on their board."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01476,2022-04-05-T-019,1476,Janet Ang,"FWAs are not just for the large companies. Singapore SME, Absolute Kinetics Consultancy (AKC), gives its employees additional leave to support their child’s first day of school, enhanced paid childcare leave of two days on top of MOM-stipulated childcare leave as well as eldercare leave. AKC also allows its staff to leave work a few hours earlier once a month to spend time with loved ones. AKC conducts cross-training for staff from different departments, so that they can cover one another, and this also builds stronger teamwork and fraternity amongst the employees."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01477,2022-04-05-T-019,1477,Janet Ang,"SMEs may be concerned with their limited capacity to implement good policies and processes for FWAs. SMEs can tap on Government funding, and Singapore Human Resource Institute, or SHRI, SBF and TACs can all support the SMEs in their journey."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01478,2022-04-05-T-019,1478,Janet Ang,"The largest employer, I think one of the largest, is the public sector. It can play a key role in setting best practices for FWAs. KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) provides an on-site childcare centre with special rates for employees. They have policies for FWAs which include compressed work week, flexi-time and part-time work to suit their staff’s needs. Of course, KKH will have lactation rooms for nursing moms but they also organise family events, such as ""Eat With Your Family Day""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01479,2022-04-05-T-019,1479,Janet Ang,"I am a personal beneficiary of FWAs. IBM implemented many of these policies as far back as the 1990s. And I treasure the fact that I did not have to miss most of my children's significant moments. I was empowered to be fully mom and fully IBMer, knowing that appraisal and promotion are based on personal commitment to results and outcomes, and not on time clocked in the office. Because the company was supportive of my personal goals of being a working mom, I probably worked triply hard. And I am quite sure all my fellow female IBMers at all levels can say the same."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01480,2022-04-05-T-019,1480,Janet Ang,"Second point  managing workplace bullying and discrimination. Fair practice in the workplace and zero tolerance of workplace discrimination are an imperative for a productive and trusting workplace culture. The issues of unconscious bias and unintentional discrimination are often more acute for women. We have heard some of them in this Chamber today. I will give you another few. Managers being unconsciously biased against their pregnant women employees for particular assignments or jobs, or – I am sure you have heard of this one – managers expressing distress that their female staff is going to be away for four months of maternity leave and so on and so forth."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01481,2022-04-05-T-019,1481,Janet Ang,"Line managers need to be trained to raise awareness of inclusive behaviours, set expectations on consequences and create a culture that enables staff to feel safe to speak up. Companies should have a whistle-blowing process, so that victims can safely speak up and have their grievances heard. Singapore Human Resource Institute, or SHRI, shares with me that they have a one-stop HR shared services centre that provides HR solutioning for grievance handling, employee engagement, background screening services and compliance audits. Earlier on, we heard hon Member Seah Kian Peng shared with us that NTUC has the same. So, SMEs can turn to SHRI or NTUC for support."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01482,2022-04-05-T-019,1482,Janet Ang,"The Government intends to write into law unacceptable practices. Hopefully, this big stick will be used as a last resort only and that our companies in Singapore, both the employers and the employees, will be able to work together to create a productive and respectful workplace culture with the increased awareness and training on managing biases and fair workplace practices."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01483,2022-04-05-T-019,1483,Janet Ang,"Next, addressing the Great Resignation – making the workplace work for our next generation. Most managers and leaders who are now in decision-making positions grew up in a different era than our millennials and Gen Z women and men who have joined the workforce in recent years. To address the Great Resignation, leaders need to understand what is important to the next generation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01484,2022-04-05-T-019,1484,Janet Ang,"Firstly, our next generation looks for positive workplace culture, where there is respect for one another, up and down and sideways; open and honest communication that is supportive and nurturing; respect boundaries of time for work and time for family, friends and self-care. WhatsApp and email without limits and consideration are a big no-no."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01485,2022-04-05-T-019,1485,Janet Ang,"Secondly, the next generation looks to an employer who cares for them as a person and not just as a serial number; who is mindful of their mental health and well-being; and who provides them with skills and career development with equal opportunity and access to jobs, roles and promotion."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01486,2022-04-05-T-019,1486,Janet Ang,"Thirdly, for them, their desire is for work to be purposeful, that is, there is meaning to the work and they can see the impact on clients, the community and society, country, environment, humanity; and they can see how their work aligns with the company’s vision, mission and purpose."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01487,2022-04-05-T-019,1487,Janet Ang,"Finally, of course, they expect salary and benefits like leave, medical, FWAs to be fair, progressive and competitive with those in the industry."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01488,2022-04-05-T-019,1488,Janet Ang,"The next generation is prepared to work hard but just not all of the time. They want to live their lives to the fullest. Our next generation can teach us many things, just as our senior workers can offer their wisdom and experience. Employers need to design their workplace and workplace culture to work better for the next generation workforce if they want to succeed in the race for talent. The next generation is more prepared than us to vote with their feet."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01489,2022-04-05-T-019,1489,Janet Ang,"My fourth topic  advancing women in senior leadership and board representation. Many women have been given opportunities to contribute and excel, rising up to a-third of the senior management positions in the workplace. We have made improvements on the boards of the top 100 SGX-listed companies, from 7.5% of women directors in 2013, to close to 20% on 1 January 2022. Statutory Boards have also heeded the call for more balanced gender representation on boards and made good progress, improving from 23% in 2018, to 30% by the end 2021. Top 100 Institutions of Public Character (IPCs) have close to 30% of their board members represented by women. Internationally, however, Singapore's 20% lags the average Women on Boards (WOB) percentage of developed markets at 25.8%."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01490,2022-04-05-T-019,1490,Janet Ang,"Board diversity is a business imperative for organisations' sustainability and resilience. WOB is but one aspect of diversity but a very visible one. Investors and employees are increasingly looking to putting their money with companies that show up on the radar of diversity, inclusion and sustainability. The ecosystem is asking for change and accountability. Take, for example, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors expect their portfolio companies in Singapore to have at least one woman director and may vote against the re-election of directors deemed responsible for the lack of female participation on boards, starting from the 2022 proxy season."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01491,2022-04-05-T-019,1491,Janet Ang,"While there are some people questioning whether there is an adequate pool of board-ready female candidates in Singapore, Mr Simon Israel, the Board Chair of Sing Post and previously Singtel, once said, and I quote, ""If you are prepared to have a much wider profile of what could bring diversity to the board, the gene pool is much bigger than boards probably think it is."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01492,2022-04-05-T-019,1492,Janet Ang,"Council for Board Diversity, Singapore Institute of Directors and executive search firms are all ready to support Board Chairs to fill credible and talented women on their nomination slates for serious consideration and selection. I should declare I am a member of the Council for Board Diversity."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01493,2022-04-05-T-019,1493,Janet Ang,"It is encouraging to see progressive companies make concerted efforts to harness the benefits of having more women on their boards. Take Venture Corporation Limited, SATS Ltd, Singapore Post Limited, Far East Hospitality Trust and, most recently, Thomson Medical, for example. These boards had zero women in 2013 on their boards but each has at least 30% women on their boards today. They are blazing the trail for others to follow. In Singapore, we do not recommend quotas for WOBs, as it can lead to tokenism. Like others have said, I think Singapore women, we can do it. We do not need charity."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01494,2022-04-05-T-019,1494,Janet Ang,"We are hopeful that with the momentum built and with the nine-year cap on independent directors rule change that has kicked in on 1 January, we should get to 25% by 2025 and 30% by 2030."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01495,2022-04-05-T-019,1495,Janet Ang,"Singapore's President, Mdm Halimah Yacob, recently said and I quote, ""The pandemic has highlighted the importance of diversity in leadership. Organisations with few or no women directors should cast the net wide for the best talents and experience to contribute to their boards … (and) position their organisations well for long-term success."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01496,2022-04-05-T-019,1496,Janet Ang,"And on to my final point, balance between family and career. I would like to share my personal reflection on the balance between family and career, and the dignity of being a working mom."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01497,2022-04-05-T-019,1497,Janet Ang,"Long ago, I once thought that I had to choose between family or career and even told my boss, who was a man back then, ""You do not have to promote me. I am getting married."" Thankfully, I had an enlightened boss who ignored my declaration and went on to give me my first management role while I was on honeymoon. And the rest is history. I have four daughters after that."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01498,2022-04-05-T-019,1498,Janet Ang,"And they tell me, the joke is, each time I have a daughter, each time I have a child, I got promoted. So, they asked me if the factory will keep going. And thankfully, my workplace was a workplace that works for women like me and my colleagues at all levels to have pretty fulfilling careers while bringing up our families, too. I must say at this point I am grateful that I have a supportive husband who definitely broke all norms at that time, decided to quit his job and be the trailing spouse when I was offered international assignments overseas and has since been the Mr Mom for our family. He broke the record because, when we were in Japan, the Parents' Association was called Mothers' Association."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01499,2022-04-05-T-019,1499,Speaker,"Ms Janet Ang, you may have four children, but you have 30 seconds left."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01500,2022-04-05-T-019,1500,Janet Ang,"Okay. Sorry, Sir. All through my journey, there are many moments when I had to stop, in partnership with my spouse, to discern, decide the choices and the steps to take to move forward."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01501,2022-04-05-T-019,1501,Janet Ang,"I understand that many young women today are troubled by whether they should focus on their career or plan to start a family. And non-therapeutic preservation of human eggs appears to be the solution to their troubles, offering women the freedom to opt for work and delay settling down and defer starting a family. After many years of debate on this issue, the Government has indicated an intended legislation to provide women aged 21 to 35 years, regardless of marital status, to preserve their eggs, and that only legally married couples can use their frozen eggs for procreation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01502,2022-04-05-T-019,1502,Janet Ang,What does this mean for women? Will this put our women in a difficult position to have to choose to abdicate authentic womenhood and motherhood to technology because technology makes it possible for non-therapeutic egg freezing?
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01503,2022-04-05-T-019,1503,Janet Ang,"What does this mean for the workplace? How will the workplace respond? Will the workplace consider women who choose not to postpone childbearing with the freezing of their eggs, as not being sufficiently committed to their career, thus harming their progress?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01504,2022-04-05-T-019,1504,Janet Ang,"What does this mean for society? The cost of freezing and storing of human eggs is not insignificant, and one needs to add to it the cost of IVF treatment."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01505,2022-04-05-T-019,1505,Speaker,"Ms Janet Ang, you can wrap up."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01506,2022-04-05-T-019,1506,Janet Ang,Will this lead to inevitable widening of the inequality? I worry that maternity will soon run the risk of being a commodity.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01507,2022-04-05-T-019,1507,Janet Ang,"So, the time to act is now for our tripartite partners to urgently make the workplace work better for our women, especially the next generation, so that they can be supported to have fulfilling careers and have a life and a family as naturally as possible. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion and celebrate the White Paper coming to fruition. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01508,2022-04-05-T-019,1508,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the White Paper on Singapore Women's Development."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01509,2022-04-05-T-019,1509,Cheng Li Hui,"Firstly, I want to say ""thank you"" on behalf of the many women out there. The proposal to legalise elective egg freezing for women aged 21 to 35, regardless of marital status, is an incredibly important development. For us women, the passage of time affects our bodies significantly and our health and fertility may not hold up until situations finally allow us to have babies."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01510,2022-04-05-T-019,1510,Cheng Li Hui,"For couples who have difficulties conceiving, the road to parenthood can be so very tedious, frustrating, demoralising and expensive. In 2020, we took concrete steps to help women and couples fulfil their dream of parenthood with measures, such as removing the age limit for women undergoing IVF and enhancing the Government co-funding for assisted reproduction technology (ART) procedures. Today, we are able to take another step forward with elective egg freezing for all healthy women aged 21 to 35."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01511,2022-04-05-T-019,1511,Cheng Li Hui,"This is a topic close to my heart and I have been raising Parliamentary Questions on this since 2016. Last year, I devoted my entire Budget speech on egg freezing. Why?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01512,2022-04-05-T-019,1512,Cheng Li Hui,"In 2015, I started the Baby Joy Programme in Tampines East, where I would visit families with newborns. I brought diaper cakes to congratulate them on the arrival of their new bundle of joy. It was at all these house visits that I heard the stories of their journey to parenthood. For many couples, the process was not easy at all."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01513,2022-04-05-T-019,1513,Cheng Li Hui,"It was clear to me that, with today's improvement in medical technology, we can definitely do more at so many levels to help women make informed and individual choices to preserve their right to motherhood."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01514,2022-04-05-T-019,1514,Cheng Li Hui,"Take, for example, Janet, 38 years old, who is struggling with IVF as there seemed to be issues with the quality of her eggs. She wanted to freeze them at 33 but did not because she could not fly out due to work commitments. She met her husband at age 35. She said she always dated with marriage as an end goal, but the dating scene was limited for her as a 30-something woman. Now that she is ready, her eggs are no longer quite as ready."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01515,2022-04-05-T-019,1515,Cheng Li Hui,"Another, 33 years old, said she is a PHD holder of a Government scholarship and is single not by choice. She tried online dating, asking friends for help but things just did not work out. She said ""educated women are not overly picky"" but she feels she has not been lucky. She added that she just came out of an abusive relationship. Is it better for her to settle and have a child grow up in a potentially abusive environment, or end it, recover and start her search again for Mr Right? She wants to try again and she looks forward to being a mother one day. She needs to buy some time."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01516,2022-04-05-T-019,1516,Cheng Li Hui,"The reality is that, for various reasons, marrying and starting families early are not always possible. Even if it is the ideal scenario, sometimes, things just do not work out."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01517,2022-04-05-T-019,1517,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest we extend the age limit for elective egg freezing to 40 years old. While I understand scientific evidence shows that the quality of a woman's eggs depreciates significantly after the age of 35, we all know that it has now become relatively common for women to conceive between the ages of 35 and 40 and, some, even in their early 40s."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01518,2022-04-05-T-019,1518,Cheng Li Hui,"Sir, while I am delighted with the proposed recommendation allowing women to start freezing their eggs from the age of 21, most women really only think of egg freezing when they are in their 30s. I have spoken to so many women and this seems rather clear. When I did the Journey to Parenthood survey in 2019, those in the 25 to 29 age range took a neutral stand to egg freezing. It is just not something they are thinking of at that age. They are focused on better jobs and pay, dating, clubbing, travel. The world is their oyster."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01519,2022-04-05-T-019,1519,Cheng Li Hui,"Before they know it, they will be in their 30s and may be in the situations not unlike the stories I shared earlier. Where did the time go? How can I find the right partner?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01520,2022-04-05-T-019,1520,Cheng Li Hui,"I find it a huge pity that the age limit is set at 35 and that this policy is underserving a very important age segment, that is, those aged 36-40. My sense is, even with the new policy, it will be women in their 30s who will form the majority who choose to undergo this procedure. If I may humbly ask, can we have more discussions on the age limit and finetune the legislation?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01521,2022-04-05-T-019,1521,Cheng Li Hui,"Another reason why women in their early 20s are not likely to undergo elective egg freezing is the issue of cost. Many understand that egg freezing is an elective procedure and if they want it, they know they have to save for it. The cost of $10,000 to $12,000, while not cheap, is saveable for many. However, this tends to happen when there is a certain level of financial stability and that only happens when one enters one's 30s."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01522,2022-04-05-T-019,1522,Cheng Li Hui,"A fortnight ago, before the White Paper was out, I did a live Instagram session with Dr Janice Tung, a gynaecologist, and Nicole, a moderator invited by Love Bonito, a local fashion apparel company. About 9,000 followers tuned in that night and we had a very lively discussion on egg freezing. Many commented that egg freezing is the right of the individual woman, a personal choice – a women's right to preserve her chances of motherhood if she so chooses to do."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01523,2022-04-05-T-019,1523,Cheng Li Hui,"From the Instagram live session, I learnt that people are curious. We discussed cost, the process, success rate of live birth, how many eggs were needed, what is the annual maintenance cost and, of course, other questions. But before the session started, I asked the team if they had considered egg freezing and if they had also seen a gynaecologist before. Almost all replied no."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01524,2022-04-05-T-019,1524,Cheng Li Hui,"Sir, I often asked the same question when I met participants and activists who are single, and journalists, both at egg freezing dialogues and interviews. Most would tell me they have spoken to friends or are researching on it but, so far, I have not had anyone who said they had been to a gynaecologist."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01525,2022-04-05-T-019,1525,Cheng Li Hui,Women need to be better informed and understand their bodies. They need to consult their gynaecologist earlier in order to understand their fertility health.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01526,2022-04-05-T-019,1526,Cheng Li Hui,"I have met many couples in their late 20s and early 30s who struggle with fertility issues. Many young couples who struggle with fertility issues were surprised to be in that situation. Many assumed that the problem is only after 35 years old. Ladies do not screen early enough to detect the possible issues. Some common issues, such as endometriosis and PCOS, affect 20%-30% of women of reproductive age and these can cause infertility. Early detection can help them significantly."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01527,2022-04-05-T-019,1527,Cheng Li Hui,"On this topic of female fertility wellness, I would also like to bring up the possibility of funding for female fertility screening. I hope that the Government can implement a subsidised ladies' health check for women in their late 20s to early 30s or allow MediSave withdrawal for such screening and consultations."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01528,2022-04-05-T-019,1528,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this step forward is a recognition of women's rights and trusting our ability to make our own choices. The role of the media in educating the public was crucial in this. When I first raised egg freezing in 2016, The Straits Times carried it as the top story in The Sunday Times. When I asked a Parliamentary Question (PQ) in 2017, Zaobao had a half page article to educate their readers on egg freezing. Over the years, there have been many articles to spread awareness – CNA, TODAY, Mothership, Her World and many more. Celebrities, like Ase Wang, also shared about her egg freezing journey. We were together on a radio show last year and she shared her views quite candidly with the audience as well. Dr Ann Tan, Dr Loh Seong Feei and many more were taking interviews and advocating for the cause."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01529,2022-04-05-T-019,1529,Cheng Li Hui,"With more conversations, better knowledge and counselling, we, women, can shift mindsets, stay updated and make sensible choices for ourselves and our future. I support the Motion. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01530,2022-04-05-T-019,1530,Speaker,Ms Joan Pereira.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01531,2022-04-05-T-019,1531,Joan Pereira,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am most heartened by the wide range of action plans to support women's development in the White Paper and even more heartened that the various initiatives to develop and support women by our different Ministries and agencies will be augmented by the whole-of-society approach proposed in the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01532,2022-04-05-T-019,1532,Joan Pereira,"I would like to speak on improving the assistance for caregivers, many of whom are women and, particularly, for those looking after the elderly. This will probably be the largest group to be cared for, given our rapidly ageing population. Caregivers are emotionally connected to their charges, such that even if respite care of two to three hours is offered, they may not take it up because they do not have ease of mind when another person helps to take over. This situation is most common when the elderly has complex medical conditions or is attached to familiar faces."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01533,2022-04-05-T-019,1533,Joan Pereira,"Therefore, I welcome the proposals to enhance respite care options for caregivers of seniors and to offer them more help. What I would like to see is how we can further tighten the assistance framework so as to help lessen the stress on caregivers and on social workers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01534,2022-04-05-T-019,1534,Joan Pereira,"Presently, the Agency for Integrated Care, or AIC, refers caregivers to the appropriate help resources but the help would be once, twice or even thrice-off, until their issues are resolved and the case is considered closed. However, for many caregivers, the issues never really go away. Their need for help arises at the most unexpected of times when emergencies arise. Therefore, it is very important that caregivers have a constant, familiar contact to call, so that suitable and expedient help can be offered. Sometimes, this may mean just listening and giving some advice on how to handle difficult situations and does not necessarily mean that it always needs to be a physical meeting. Knowing that there is someone who will be there for them in times of need will take a huge stress off their minds."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01535,2022-04-05-T-019,1535,Joan Pereira,"I would like to suggest having a team of persons who can journey with the caregivers. The reason for a team is to minimise disruptions in case the case manager has to go on leave, be changed to a different department and so on and so forth. Having a team befriend them and be a point of contact (POC) for them so that they know they can turn to that POC for help rather than different persons talking to them will be extremely useful. Could AIC consider looking into this, or even to empower partner social service agencies to build up such capabilities as well?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01536,2022-04-05-T-019,1536,Joan Pereira,"As part of the White Paper is to call for a mid-term review, may I ask what do we hope to see at the mid-term review, in terms of targets being set? I would like to propose that a survey be conducted to check in on caregivers to find out if the team concept for respite support is working for them and is able to effectively help them in their caregiving journey."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01537,2022-04-05-T-019,1537,Joan Pereira,"While there is consideration of a community peer support network, the key to making this model work is to recruit volunteers who have the bandwidth to undertake such tasks, as well as to provide training to equip them with the expertise to take care of seniors. I have also received feedback from caregivers about stand-in caregivers to stay temporarily at the seniors' homes who might help relieve some stress. However, very often, this arrangement is not suitable because the size and condition of some flats may just not allow it."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01538,2022-04-05-T-019,1538,Joan Pereira,"What may help would be having an institutional set-up with care centres, where seniors can check in for a few days and the caregivers will be able to take a break from caregiving duties."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01539,2022-04-05-T-019,1539,Joan Pereira,"Currently, there are limited provisions for such arrangements and advanced reservations need to be made. The costs vary but some households may have problems affording them. If the Ministry can increase the number of places at subsidised rates, it would be helpful. Sir, in Mandarin."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01540,2022-04-05-T-019,1540,Joan Pereira,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Presently, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) refers caregivers to suitable help resources but most assistance is temporary. However, for most caregivers, the problems do not really disappear. Hence, what is important is that they must have a suitable and familiar contact, in order to get access to suitable and convenient help, especially in emergencies. This will reduce their stress."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01541,2022-04-05-T-019,1541,Joan Pereira,"I would like to suggest having a team as the caregivers' contact point. Having a team, compared to a single case manager, as the point of contact is more sustainable. Will AIC consider this suggestion, even empower partner social services organisations to arrange likewise?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01542,2022-04-05-T-019,1542,Joan Pereira,"Setting up institutional care centres may be helpful, where seniors can check in for a few days while the caregivers take a short break. Presently, provisions for such arrangements are limited and need advance reservations. The fees vary but some households may find them hard to afford. If the Ministry can provide subsidies and increase the number of places, these will be helpful."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01543,2022-04-05-T-019,1543,Joan Pereira,"(In English)  Finally, I would like to request a waiver of the ElderShield payouts' annual disability reassessment for those whose conditions are permanent, to relieve the stress on caregivers. Indeed, the whole of society can do our part to better support our caregivers. Sir, I support the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01544,2022-04-05-T-019,1544,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01545,2022-04-05-T-019,1545,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, the White Paper is a firm commitment to the women of Singapore. I am especially heartened by its support for key issues like equal workplace opportunities, caregiver support and protection against violence, which have been championed by activists and women for many years."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01546,2022-04-05-T-019,1546,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Let me start by talking briefly about men. This White Paper is, indeed, about women's development. But I hope we can all agree that the action plans in the White Paper are good not only for women, but also for men and, indeed, all of Singapore. They steer our society towards a healthier, fairer set of norms, cultures and practices. And that is something we should all be able to celebrate."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01547,2022-04-05-T-019,1547,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Today, I will raise three proposals. First, we should equalise paternity and maternity leave benefits. Second, we should legislate the right to request work from home. And third, we should end the stigma against single unwed parents by extending to them the Parenthood Tax Rebate, the Working Mothers' Child Relief and the cash component of the Baby Bonus."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01548,2022-04-05-T-019,1548,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My first proposal is that we gradually equalise paternity and maternity leave entitlements. Members of this House will be no stranger to my daughters Ella, Katie and Poppy. Some Members tell me they feel like they know my daughters quite well now, just from the stories I tell about them through my speeches in Parliament. They are a huge part of my life and I have learnt a lot from them."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01549,2022-04-05-T-019,1549,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Of the memories I have shared, the ones that stick most are from when Ella, Katie and Poppy were born, when they were babies. Paternity leave was a special time, and my only regret is that it was not long enough. My factory is now closed. So, I will never enjoy paternity leave again. As Ms Joan Pereira has said, when you have twins, you will never have more kids."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01550,2022-04-05-T-019,1550,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"But even as paternity leave becomes a thing of the past for me, I want to make sure fathers of our future get to spend more time with their babies. As I have said many times in this House, ""Spend time with those you love. One of these days, you will either say I wish I had or I am glad I did."" Study after study show that paternity leave is vital. Researchers at NUS looked into this and published their findings just a few months ago. Their paper ""documents the positive relationship between paternity leave provision and family dynamics and children's well-being in Singapore""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01551,2022-04-05-T-019,1551,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Taking paternity leave not only gives fathers the ""immediate benefit"" of sharing joy and responsibility of caring for the newborn, but ends up having a ""mid-to-long-term impact on children's and family's well-being"". Longer leaves are significantly related to lower family conflict, lower maternal depression, higher marital satisfaction and fewer behavioural problems for the child. In other words, paternity leave is good for fathers, mothers and children. It is a win-win for everyone."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01552,2022-04-05-T-019,1552,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Some have said that mothers need more leave than fathers because mothers need to physically recover from childbirth. But this is all the more reason why paternity leave needs to be equal with maternity leave. Fathers need to be there as well, otherwise mothers will spend their 16 weeks of leave single-handedly caring for the newborn; and that is no rest at all."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01553,2022-04-05-T-019,1553,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"A young father recently reminded me how insufficient two weeks of paternity leave are. Let me share his story, ""When my firstborn arrived two years ago, I went back to work after two weeks. My wife was still recovering from labour and was bleeding and had stitches and still needed bed rest, except she could not. Once I resumed work, she had to care for the baby, all while learning the ropes to be a new mom. It broke my heart to return from work every day to see her collapsed and break. Two weeks, even if taken flexibly, is not enough. It is not just about the baby; it is also about the mother. Our wives have gone through enough to bring life into the world. Please let us stay home, to take care of the big and little things, so that they can focus on recovery and all the other things we cannot do, like create milk""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01554,2022-04-05-T-019,1554,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"It broke my heart to read this and I hope the Government can rethink whether paternity leave should really be less than maternity leave. Let me say one more thing about our low level paternity leave  it entrenches gender stereotypes. A 2019 IPS research paper stated that ""family policies in Singapore continue to signal that childcare is a woman's responsibility and reinforce gender stereotypes""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01555,2022-04-05-T-019,1555,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"It is hard to argue against this. We give mothers 16 weeks of maternity leave and fathers two weeks of paternity leave. Mommy stays at home and daddy goes to work. That is the message we send. The worst part of the problem is that it is self-reinforcing because we give fathers less leave, they do not get to develop the skills and confidence needed to care for their kids. This, the IPS study finds, causes them to leave childcare to mothers. The IPS study proposes that we increase the amount of paternity leave. I wholeheartedly support this call and hope that we can set a target year, perhaps 2030, by which time we will have an equal amount of paternity and maternity leave."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01556,2022-04-05-T-019,1556,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We can increase paternity leave in phases, giving our employers time to plan ahead, while also providing a clear signal of our intentions to reduce gendered perceptions of parenthood. I hope the Minister will look into this proposal in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the tripartite partners and NGOs, such as Families for Life and Centre for Fathering."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01557,2022-04-05-T-019,1557,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My second proposal today is that we legislate to give employees the right to request work from home, which employers can turn down only on the basis of valid business-related reasons. Legislate and not just have guidelines. Having just guidelines does not show that we place a strong importance on this. Survey after survey show that Singaporeans want this and some would rather continue working remotely than receive a bigger bonus."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01558,2022-04-05-T-019,1558,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We have also known for a long time that work-from-home narrows the gender pay gap. The pandemic has also highlighted that work-from-home can reshape gendered stereotypes of ""Daddy goes to work, mommy stays at home."" An economics research paper titled ""The Impact of COVID-19 on Gender Equality"" found that the pandemic, by forcing people to stay at home, has likely led to an increase in fathers taking on childcare responsibilities."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01559,2022-04-05-T-019,1559,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The paper concludes that this increase may sustain only if the fathers continue to have increased flexibility to work from home. The media has also reported stories of how COVID-19 has given fathers a chance to bond with their kids. Imran, a marketing manager, talked about how his wife and him are so glad that he now has more time to play and eat together with his two toddler children. Imran shared that after this increased time together, his kids now miss him even when he steps out of the house briefly."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01560,2022-04-05-T-019,1560,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, the pandemic has brought about a momentum for greater gender equality in childcare. We will lose this momentum unless fathers continue to get access to work from home. It is clear – we need to legislate the right to work from home. To be clear, fathers taking on more childcare responsibilities is a positive step for women's development. It spreads out the burden of childcare between the parents. It frees women from the stereotype that they will stay home to care for their children."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01561,2022-04-05-T-019,1561,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Giving everyone the right to work from home will reshape the attitudes of employers towards women. It would also likely increase the female labour force participation rate, which, as Minister Tan See Leng has shared, is extremely low among women – only about 80% of women aged 25 to 64 are in the labour force."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01562,2022-04-05-T-019,1562,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Legislating the right to work from home would send a strong signal, like how we are legislating the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices to send a stronger signal that unfair employment practices of all forms, including against women, are not tolerated."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01563,2022-04-05-T-019,1563,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,We can carefully scope this new law together with the tripartite partners. There is no reason why we cannot design a balanced effective law that is a win-win for everyone.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01564,2022-04-05-T-019,1564,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My third and final proposal is that we end the continued discrimination against single unwed parents. For decades, Members of this House have been speaking up for single unwed parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01565,2022-04-05-T-019,1565,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In 1997, Minister Shanmugam questioned how it could be ""morally justifiable to deny an unwed mother and her child public housing"". In 2006, Minister Indranee Rajah said that to build an inclusive society, policies affecting certain segments, such as single parents, had to change. In 2011, Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary called for Singaporeans to be compassionate, to treat single parents with dignity and not to punish single parents and their children."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01566,2022-04-05-T-019,1566,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thankfully, we have made progress. Single unwed mothers now receive the same 16 weeks of maternity leave as married mothers. Their children now benefit from Child Development Accounts. Most recently, we have allowed single unwed parents to apply for rental housing and buy subsidised HDB flats from HDB."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01567,2022-04-05-T-019,1567,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I thank the Government for listening to their concerns and responding positively. As MND has acknowledged, ""Single unwed parents are valued citizens and, like all parents, are respected for the love and care they provide for their children. They are no less a mother or a father, just because their child was born outside of marriage""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01568,2022-04-05-T-019,1568,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I am glad that the White Paper recognises the need to help single parents. It recommends increased support for single parents as one of the six focal areas in the Alliance for Action to strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01569,2022-04-05-T-019,1569,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"While I am confident the Alliance will help reduce the stigma against single parents, we cannot run away from the elephant in the room. The Government has a whole suite of parenthood policies that expressly exclude single unwed parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01570,2022-04-05-T-019,1570,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"These policies are the Parenthood Tax Rebate, the Working Mothers' Child Relief and the cash component of the Baby Bonus."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01571,2022-04-05-T-019,1571,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Are single unwed parents any less a parent? Are unwed working mothers any less a working mother? And are babies of single unwed parents any less a baby?
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01572,2022-04-05-T-019,1572,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We may answer no, but these policies signal the opposite thing. Even if it is not the Government's intention, these policies suggest that single unwed parents are a less worthy set of parents. Less worthy of support."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01573,2022-04-05-T-019,1573,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"This discrimination is a painful one because it is especially hard to be a single unwed parent. As Minister of State Sun Xueling acknowledged during this year's Committee of Supply debates, ""It is not easy to bring up children, even more so, single-handedly."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01574,2022-04-05-T-019,1574,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The numbers speak for themselves. Young single unwed parents have a median monthly income of just $600, among the lowest in Singapore. Inflation is hurting everyone but they are the ones who will most have to scrimp and save. Yet, we deny them the support all other parents get."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01575,2022-04-05-T-019,1575,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,We already agree on so many things. We agree that healthy intact families are ideal but staying together is not always possible or even good. We agree that single unwed parents and their children face stigma and have to overcome exceptional challenges.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01576,2022-04-05-T-019,1576,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Many of us felt this stigma first-hand at a recent dialogue session where single unwed parents spoke courageously about the stigma they faced. Many were in tears as they spoke. As Minister of State Sun Xueling shared after the dialogue, ""They shared the pain and hurt felt when faced with the stigma that comes with being a single unwed parent."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01577,2022-04-05-T-019,1577,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,We can help end this stigma. What we need to do is end the discrimination in our parenthood support policies.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01578,2022-04-05-T-019,1578,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, to conclude, we need to do three things. First, we need to equalise maternity and paternity leave entitlements. Second, we need to legislate the right to request work from home, which employers can reject only for valid business-related reasons. Third, we need to stop excluding single unwed parents from the Parenthood Tax Rebate, the Working Mothers' Child Relief and the cash component of the Baby Bonus."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01579,2022-04-05-T-019,1579,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The White Paper is our commitment to a fairer and more inclusive Singapore. I am thankful for many of the action plans sketched out in it. Indeed, they promise a brighter tomorrow for the women, men and children of Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01580,2022-04-05-T-019,1580,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I started this speech talking about how the development of women is something that all men and, indeed, all of us in Singapore can celebrate. Let me end by sharing a quote from Ban Ki-Moon, ""Achieving gender equality requires the engagement of women and men, girls and boys. It is everybody's responsibility."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01581,2022-04-05-T-019,1581,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We can and need to go further in order for Singapore's march towards gender equality to make true progress. Sir, I support the Motion."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01582,2022-04-05-T-019,1582,Speaker,Ms Hany Soh.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01583,2022-04-05-T-019,1583,Hany Soh,"Mr Speaker, I wish to first declare that I am a practising lawyer and serve as the Chairperson of Law Society's Pro Bono Services' (LSPBS) Community Legal Clinics Committee and as a member of the Law Society's Family Law Practice Committee."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01584,2022-04-05-T-019,1584,Hany Soh,"Notwithstanding that women's welfare, rights and development have progressed tremendously over the years, I believe that there is more that we, as a community, can do for the last, the lost and the least."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01585,2022-04-05-T-019,1585,Hany Soh,"The working mothers who struggle between providing for their families and in raising their children, the homemakers with dependants with no avenue of financial support, the women trapped in unhappy and abusive marriages as well as those who experience harmful behaviour online – all of them deserve the same opportunities for self-reliance and peace of mind, no matter their situation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01586,2022-04-05-T-019,1586,Hany Soh,"For the purpose of today's speech, I will be focusing on enhancing support for three types of vulnerable groups  one, the victims of online harm; two, those who are feeling helpless as a result of a broken marriage; and three, homemakers with dependants in low-income families who are in need of a stable source of income."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01587,2022-04-05-T-019,1587,Hany Soh,"As shared earlier by Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, in conjunction with our PAP Women's Wing International Day celebrations this year, we have organised a series of law awareness talks centred on the issue of online harm. As a follow-up, together with Ms Nadia Samdin, we launched an online toolkit to empower all of our PAP branch activists with useful information to assist victims who are facing online harm."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01588,2022-04-05-T-019,1588,Hany Soh,"During this period, we realised that many victims have chosen to suffer in silence as they either felt embarrassed and/or thought that there is no recourse available to them even if they were to report to the relevant authorities. This mentality worries me as it must have been detrimental to their mental well-being."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01589,2022-04-05-T-019,1589,Hany Soh,I share the same sentiment as Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim that more needs to be done to increase awareness and to win the trust of the victims to open up and seek help.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01590,2022-04-05-T-019,1590,Hany Soh,"Apart from equipping more community volunteers with what was shared in the toolkit, I also hope that more of such law awareness talks can take place in our community. In this regard, the Sunlight Alliance for Action can collaborate with the Law Society of Singapore to take the lead, inviting partners such as psychologists, Police and social media companies, to participate and share more on the recourse available to victims. Apart from discussing topics, such as voyeurism and cyber bullying, we should also venture into tips on combating online scams that many seniors and single women have fallen prey to lately."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01591,2022-04-05-T-019,1591,Hany Soh,"During the course of my practice as a matrimonial lawyer and in my time volunteering in legal clinics, I have come across many helpless women who have approached me to seek legal advice. Many of them would often begin by sharing that they are contemplating a divorce but do not know if they should proceed to do so."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01592,2022-04-05-T-019,1592,Hany Soh,"Some of them had gotten married early, barely worked and accumulated any savings, whether personal or in CPF. Some may have once had a decent career but chose to give it up after giving birth, effectively sacrificed their independence and out of the workforce for years to focus entirely on taking care of their family's well-being."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01593,2022-04-05-T-019,1593,Hany Soh,"Despite being unhappy in the marriage for years, some even suffering from domestic violence in the process, the thought of undergoing a divorce puts them in great fear, the possibility of losing the roof over their head or self-doubt as to whether they would be able to bring up their children single-handedly. Some worry that if the divorce proceedings become contentious, it may wear them out both financially and emotionally."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01594,2022-04-05-T-019,1594,Hany Soh,"At present, the Family Justice Courts (FJC), through the support of LSPBS, runs a regular legal clinic to provide preliminary advice to individuals, regardless of their gender and nationality, on their legal rights when filing or defending proceedings in the FJC. I believe its effectiveness can be further enhanced by having a social worker participate in such sessions to assist those in need of other assistance, such as financial resources or employment opportunities, which are essential for divorcees, especially those homemakers and victims of domestic violence, to regain their confidence post-divorce."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01595,2022-04-05-T-019,1595,Hany Soh,This arrangement is currently on trial under the pilot collaboration between LSPBS' Community Legal Clinics' collaboration with the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre where the lawyers advise on legal matters and the Family Service Centres (FSC) social workers assist to advise on welfare-related issues.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01596,2022-04-05-T-019,1596,Hany Soh,Another most practical thing that the Courts can actually do to ease parties' emotional turmoil is to make the Court proceedings in the Family Justice Courts less acrimonious and less strenuous.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01597,2022-04-05-T-019,1597,Hany Soh,"Currently, a spouse who has been subjected to domestic violence and deprived of maintenance by her husband will have to file two applications under iFams in order to seek protection and recourse for support for her children respectively. Should she wish to file for divorce thereafter, she or her lawyer will have to apply through another platform, eLitigation, through CrimsonLogic."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01598,2022-04-05-T-019,1598,Hany Soh,"Unfortunately, she may not be able to afford the fees for her lawyer to represent her in all three applications, as having to appear in different sets of mention dates as well as the need to comply with various sets of Court directions would result in heightened legal costs – keeping in mind the fact that she has yet to be paid support in the first place by her husband. Furthermore, another enforcement Court application will also have to be made thereafter in the event her husband refuses to adhere to the maintenance order."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01599,2022-04-05-T-019,1599,Hany Soh,"Streamlining the filing process in the Family Justice Courts and having a docket system of all applications involving the same parties will save parties both time and costs. I hope that MSF will work with the Family Justice Courts to introduce a series of measures to improve the process of filing applications, such as Personal Protection Orders as well as to enhance the enforcement of maintenance orders, in the Family Justice Courts."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01600,2022-04-05-T-019,1600,Hany Soh,"Some women, despite facing great financial constraints, have become homemakers out of necessity as they have dependants that require constant care. There is more that we can do as a community to support these women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01601,2022-04-05-T-019,1601,Hany Soh,"One inspiring example was shared by one of my Woodgrove community partners, the Textile and Fashion Industry Training Centre (TaF.tc), which currently runs the Alteraround project that aims to uplift the community of women who have either lost their jobs, retired or are stay-at-home mothers who wish to earn an income at home through an alteration skill."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01602,2022-04-05-T-019,1602,Hany Soh,"Trainees graduating from the programmes are, subsequently, offered opportunities to set up businesses and an online presence for clothes alteration services, along with sewing equipment that allows them to begin operations. Since 2020, it has successfully trained more than 100 individuals and onboarded 17 seamstresses."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01603,2022-04-05-T-019,1603,Hany Soh,The Alteraround project is a small preview of what can be possible if more organisations are willing to come forward to collaborate with the community to empower homemakers with skills to be financially independent while having the flexibility to look after their families.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01604,2022-04-05-T-019,1604,Hany Soh,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, it is heartening to see that this White Paper has taken in many of the recommendations that we, the Women's Wing, together with the Young PAP of the People's Action Party, put up last year, rallying the whole of society to change mindsets and advance women's development."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01605,2022-04-05-T-019,1605,Hany Soh,"In this regard, I wish to take this opportunity to thank our PAP activists, community partners as well as residents who have shared their personal experiences with me and continued to participate in this meaningful journey with me to advance the cause of women's development. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the White Paper."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01606,2022-04-05-T-019,1606,Speaker,Minister of State Sun Xueling.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01607,2022-04-05-T-019,1607,Sun Xueling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper marks the culmination of a meaningful one-and-a-half-year journey to further advance Singapore women's development. Many organisations representing both men and women, students' unions and members of the public stepped forward with their feedback."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01608,2022-04-05-T-019,1608,Sun Xueling,"We are extremely grateful to organisations, such as SCWO, NTUC U Women and Family, People's Association-Women's Integration Network (PA-WIN), PAP Women's Wing and Young PAP, Persatuan Pemudi Islam Singapura (PPIS), AWARE and also trade associations and corporates, for putting forward proposals. My fellow co-chairs, Minister of State Low Yen Ling, Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam, and I are deeply grateful for the inputs from everyone."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01609,2022-04-05-T-019,1609,Sun Xueling,"In the White Paper, we had grouped our 25 Action Plans into five areas not only for clarity but also to allow for thorough and effective implementation. After all the conversations, it is now the time to take action. We are determined to see this through over the decade, just as how the Government has advanced the progress of women over the past decades."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01610,2022-04-05-T-019,1610,Sun Xueling,"Some have shared that the White Paper only seems to focus on Singapore women. I would like to clarify that many of the Action Plans, such as mindset shifts and protection from violence and harm, extend to all. Let me highlight a line in the Taskforce Report on Family Violence, which was referenced in the White Paper  ""Violence against all persons should not be condoned regardless of nationality, marital status, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation."""
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01611,2022-04-05-T-019,1611,Sun Xueling,"At the same time, we know that there are groups of women who face unique challenges. To address their concerns holistically, we have other workstreams, such as a committee which looks at residency and benefits for foreign spouses, which Minister Indranee Rajah chairs, supported by Minister of State Desmond Tan and myself."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01612,2022-04-05-T-019,1612,Sun Xueling,"For today, I will speak about specific groups of women who are vulnerable, their challenges and how, as a society, we can collectively protect, support and empower them."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01613,2022-04-05-T-019,1613,Sun Xueling,"We convened the Taskforce on Family Violence in February 2020 before the full effects of the pandemic on family life became apparent, which signalled our concern and focus on family violence. We brought in various partners, including the Family Violence Specialist Centres, such as PAVE, which have spent decades supporting families affected by family violence."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01614,2022-04-05-T-019,1614,Sun Xueling,"We firmly believe that, in Singapore, one of the safest cities in the world, no woman, child or vulnerable adult should have to live in fear, jump at the sound of approaching footsteps or be subjected to the abusive words and actions of a perpetrator of violence. The home is supposed to be a sanctuary for adult and child alike and we will do our utmost as authorities and as members of the public to protect those whose sanctuary has been violated by physical and sexual violence, psychological and emotional abuse and neglect."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01615,2022-04-05-T-019,1615,Sun Xueling,"One example of our firm commitment to tackle family violence is how we have taken steps to expand the National Anti-Violence Helpline (NAVH). I had announced the renaming of the NAVH to National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline to better reflect the scope of its services. This one-stop national helpline provides support for all forms of violence, including sexual violence and sexual harassment, in a familial or non-familial setting."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01616,2022-04-05-T-019,1616,Sun Xueling,"To expand the capacity of the helpline to take more calls, MSF has provided more resources to social service agency Montfort Care, which operates the NAVH, increasing the number of operators to handle calls by 70%. The MSF Adult Protective Service and Child Protective Service will also help to train the new operators to equip them to perform their roles effectively. MSF is prepared to set aside more resources if there is a further increase in call volume."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01617,2022-04-05-T-019,1617,Sun Xueling,"Accessibility is another key area that we are looking at. By end-2022, witnesses and survivors will be able to report violence or abuse with greater ease through new modes, such as a web link and mobile application."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01618,2022-04-05-T-019,1618,Sun Xueling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have seen with my own eyes the anger in the eyes of a perpetrator of violence and the damage that the perpetrator can cause to families. We will not stand by and watch vulnerable adults, men or women, children be subject to family and domestic violence. With the 16 recommendations from the Taskforce on Family Violence, we will act swiftly, strengthen deterrence and prevention, and rehabilitate perpetrators."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01619,2022-04-05-T-019,1619,Sun Xueling,"We will enhance MSF’s emergency response team. Appointed social service professionals will be empowered to go on site and jointly work with the Police to address immediate safety issues. This is by no means a soft approach, just because social service professionals are involved. If there is a risk of family violence recurring, the social service professionals will be empowered to decide on the issuance of a time limited protection notice or help victim survivors move out of their home temporarily."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01620,2022-04-05-T-019,1620,Sun Xueling,Victim-survivors facing immediate risks are not left unprotected and in the vulnerable position of having to take care of himself or herself against a perpetrator.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01621,2022-04-05-T-019,1621,Sun Xueling,The Court may make an order to authorise Adult Protective Services to remove a vulnerable adult from the place of residence if he or she is experiencing abuse and the removal is required for safety. This will also include persons with disabilities.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01622,2022-04-05-T-019,1622,Sun Xueling,"We will also increase the penalties for the violation of PPOs. Courts will also be able to make other forms of orders, such as non-visitation or non-communication orders. Public consultations for the related Women’s Charter amendments will start from tomorrow and run till the end of April."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01623,2022-04-05-T-019,1623,Sun Xueling,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim suggested adopting the Netherlands’ Orange House model of shelter for family violence survivors, for which the shelter is in a visible setting within the community."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01624,2022-04-05-T-019,1624,Sun Xueling,"As part of the step-down care to the community, residents of crisis shelters with low risk levels have an option of staying in individual housing units. Crisis shelters also adopt trauma-informed approaches to supporting family violence survivors and their children. However, for some aspects of the Orange House model, such as the open location of the shelter where perpetrators know where the survivors live, our assessment is that this may not be suitable at this point in time."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01625,2022-04-05-T-019,1625,Sun Xueling,"Next, on sexual and hurt offences. Minister Shanmugam had shared about the sentencing framework for sexual and hurt offences. The relevant Penal Code amendments have since come into force on 1 March 2022."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01626,2022-04-05-T-019,1626,Sun Xueling,"I would like to highlight that the trauma of sexual offences has a long shadow. Victim-survivors can remain traumatised by memories of the episode, have flashbacks that can be triggered by anything remotely related to the incident, develop phobias of interacting and being close to people, and suffer from self-esteem issues. Being sexually violated takes away that feeling of inner sanctity that resides deep in every individual and some survivors may withdraw and develop a sense of detachment to protect themselves from further hurt."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01627,2022-04-05-T-019,1627,Sun Xueling,"We will support victims of sexual violence, not just in the form of Police enforcement and laws and penalties but also in the form of psychosocial support and care. All Family Violence Specialist Centres and the PAVE Integrated Services for Individual and Family Protection Specialist Centre will be able to provide comprehensive support for all forms of intra- and extra-familial violence, including sexual violence, by the second half of 2022."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01628,2022-04-05-T-019,1628,Sun Xueling,"Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have, similarly, further strengthened support for victims of sexual misconduct through various measures. They have enhanced training for first responders to equip them with the skills to support victims sensitively."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01629,2022-04-05-T-019,1629,Sun Xueling,"Twenty-four-hour helplines for student care and dedicated victim-survivor care units have been established and counselling services have been enhanced. If the case involves a student or staff from the same institution, No-Contact Orders can be imposed as added protection."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01630,2022-04-05-T-019,1630,Sun Xueling,"But we know that the heart of the issue underlying many sexual offences lies in the mindsets that we have in society. We know concrete action needs to be taken to emphasise the value of respect and teach appropriate behaviour and safety, starting from a very young age from our children and our youths. And this is being done through the education journey from preschool, all the way to tertiary education."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01631,2022-04-05-T-019,1631,Sun Xueling,"Under the revised Nurturing Early Learners framework, preschool teachers will be encouraged to teach children aged four to six appropriate behaviours around body safety."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01632,2022-04-05-T-019,1632,Sun Xueling,"In Primary schools, as part of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), students learn about personal safety and the protection of oneself from unhealthy relationships, sexual grooming, exploitation and abuse."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01633,2022-04-05-T-019,1633,Sun Xueling,"In Secondary schools and at the pre-University level, students learn that respect for boundaries is fundamental for healthy relationships. The refreshed CCE curriculum brings a greater emphasis on the need to communicate, assert and respect boundaries for self and others, and the socioemotional and legal consequences one faces if they overstep these boundaries."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01634,2022-04-05-T-019,1634,Sun Xueling,"Most IHLs already have compulsory modules on respect and appropriate behaviour for students today, and the remaining IHLs will roll out such modules by mid-2022. These modules aim to promote deeper shifts in culture and mindset that will create a safe and respectful community for all. In the Autonomous Universities, students discuss and reflect on issues related to consent. Similarly, modules in the Polytechnics and ITEs emphasise the importance of respecting boundaries and the consequences for overstepping these boundaries."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01635,2022-04-05-T-019,1635,Sun Xueling,"Mr Speaker, we know that changing mindsets does not happen overnight and that is why I have laid out step-by-step what is being done for our children so that when they grow up to become adults, they are respectful, discerning and responsible."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01636,2022-04-05-T-019,1636,Sun Xueling,"But beyond mindset shifts to prevent offensive and inappropriate behaviours between the sexes, it is also important to catalyse mindset shifts so that women and men become equal partners in all areas of life, in both the workplace and at home."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01637,2022-04-05-T-019,1637,Sun Xueling,"In school materials, women’s experiences, contributions and achievements are highlighted, alongside those of their male counterparts, as content examples."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01638,2022-04-05-T-019,1638,Sun Xueling,"The refreshed CCE curriculum has Family Education as a key content area. Students learn to appreciate that members within families can play different roles regardless of gender, and that shared parental responsibilities should be discussed and mutually agreed upon."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01639,2022-04-05-T-019,1639,Sun Xueling,"Ms Poh Li San and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin spoke about the need to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in STEM. The IHLs have ongoing efforts to encourage women to enter STEM fields. For example, NTU’s Promotion of Women in Engineering, Research and Science (POWERS) programme aims to recruit and empower women with a long-term goal of increasing gender diversity in STEM careers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01640,2022-04-05-T-019,1640,Sun Xueling,"At the Secondary level, more than half of our Secondary schools offered the Applied Learning Programme in STEM areas, providing a hands-on approach to enable students to appreciate the relevance of their learning beyond the classroom in community and STEM industry settings."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01641,2022-04-05-T-019,1641,Sun Xueling,"The Education and Career Guidance(ECG) curriculum, as part of CCE in schools, also encourages students to explore a variety of education and career pathways. ECG Counsellors guide students to recognise how gender stereotypes may limit education or career pathways and to instead explore career sectors aligned to their interests and skills, including, but not limited to, STEM. These efforts in formal education complement the crucial role of parents at home and the efforts of our community partners, such as Family for Life, to change mindsets."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01642,2022-04-05-T-019,1642,Sun Xueling,"It is only when respect becomes a fundamental tenet that we can expect that when the children grow up, that men and women see each other as equals and treat each other with dignity."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01643,2022-04-05-T-019,1643,Sun Xueling,I would now like to touch on our support measures for women with differing needs.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01644,2022-04-05-T-019,1644,Sun Xueling,"Firstly, on Single Unwed parents. The Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships (AFAM) has a focal area on supporting single parents and we are looking into single parents’ access to information, alternative childcare arrangements and socioemotional support tailored to address the high stress and stigma faced by single parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01645,2022-04-05-T-019,1645,Sun Xueling,"I would like to acknowledge and thank organisations, like Morning Star Community Services, HELP Family Service Centre and PPIS As-Salaam, which have been dedicated in working to support single-parent families for many, many years."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01646,2022-04-05-T-019,1646,Sun Xueling,"As part of the work of AFAM, we will work on a new pilot. MSF will partner Daughters Of Tomorrow (DOT) to pilot a child-minding service for low-income women, including single parents, outside childcare operating hours. This is intended to ascertain the demand for such services."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01647,2022-04-05-T-019,1647,Sun Xueling,"Ms Hany Soh and Dr Wan Rizal will be happy to note that the childminding pilot has a built-in flexibility to enable users to specify their requirements, including arrangements for childminders to pick up the child from school and the location of childminding. Based on their needs, DOT will match with suitable childminders. The details of the pilot are being worked out and we will share more details in due course."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01648,2022-04-05-T-019,1648,Sun Xueling,"AFAM is also supporting MSF and NCSS’ work with HCSA Community Services to enhance their Single Parent Informed, Involved, Included (SPIN) programme portal. The enhanced portal aims to be a one-stop portal which better consolidates information on support schemes for single parents and other types of useful information, such as the location of nearby child and youth services."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01649,2022-04-05-T-019,1649,Sun Xueling,"Many of the initiatives that Minister of State Gan Siow Huang spoke about earlier, including FWAs and support for back-to-work women, will benefit all, including single unwed parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01650,2022-04-05-T-019,1650,Sun Xueling,"On housing, HDB has assured that, following their public rental application, single unwed parents will be informed of the outcome within three weeks of receiving all required information. For complex cases that need more time, HDB will provide an interim update that the application is still being assessed."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01651,2022-04-05-T-019,1651,Sun Xueling,"Ms Carrie Tan spoke about the housing insecurity that single mothers may face. We have a network of crisis shelters and transitional shelters to help our single mothers who are homeless and require social work intervention. While the shelters aim to help the residents move into long-term stable housing within six months, we understand that some residents may require a longer time to do so. Hence, we will extend their stays if social workers assess that they need more time to work on the issues that they face."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01652,2022-04-05-T-019,1652,Sun Xueling,Mr Louis Ng suggested that the full suite of Marriage and Parenthood incentives be made available to single unwed parents.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01653,2022-04-05-T-019,1653,Sun Xueling,"I had shared at my COS speech in February this year that 12 line items, which include MediSave Grant for Newborns, Infant Care Subsidy, Childcare Subsidy, Child Development Account, and so on, are available to every Singaporean child, regardless of the marital status of their parents."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01654,2022-04-05-T-019,1654,Sun Xueling,"But, at the same time, our Marriage and Parenthood policies seek to support parenthood within marriage. This is because our society continues to strongly value marriage and having children within marriage."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01655,2022-04-05-T-019,1655,Sun Xueling,"Members spoke about paternity and maternity leave entitlements and shared parental leave. I think we can all agree that employees, generally, will welcome more leave – infant care leave, childcare leave, eldercare leave. And we can also all agree that any leave enhancements will need to balance parents' caregiving needs with employers' manpower and operational needs."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01656,2022-04-05-T-019,1656,Sun Xueling,"I have listened to the various proposals from various Members. We do not differ when it comes to principles, namely, that mothers are differently impacted by the arrival of a child because they need time to recuperate from childbirth. But we also agree that men should play an important role in their child's early years and that men should be encouraged to take their paternity leave and parental leave."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01657,2022-04-05-T-019,1657,Sun Xueling,"How the leave then ought to be shared between the parents is thus a function of the overall total number of leave days provided to new parents, individual family considerations and societal mindsets and norms about the roles of fathers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01658,2022-04-05-T-019,1658,Sun Xueling,"I fully agree with Ms Carrie Tan's point that we need shifts in societal mindsets and norms so that couples can best decide how they can jointly take care of their new child without preconceived stereotypes on caregiving. In addition, workplace support is also important as it impacts the willingness of fathers to take leave. We should also not forget the very important point that Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has made with regard to FWAs, as its availability can make a big difference to how caregiving arrangements can be sorted out. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin, please."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01659,2022-04-05-T-019,1659,Sun Xueling,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] A few weeks ago, I attended a dialogue session on Singapore Women's Development organised by the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations. As housewives and caregivers, several female participants shared concerns about their financial situation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01660,2022-04-05-T-019,1660,Sun Xueling,"The family is the cornerstone of our society, and women play a crucial role in the family. Around us, we see many women juggling both work and family commitments. There are also many women who are homemakers, working hard for their families over the years. We know deep in our hearts that a warm, harmonious family provides a spiritual harbour for family members to return to after a hard day's work. With their tenderness, patience and resilience, women provide emotional support and assistance to family members."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01661,2022-04-05-T-019,1661,Sun Xueling,"Their contributions are not directly captured in our GDP, but we know that their contributions have enabled their husbands and children to succeed and helped build strong and happy families."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01662,2022-04-05-T-019,1662,Sun Xueling,"Every family is unique and the couple will share responsibilities according to their situation, in a way that is acceptable and suitable to both parties. The Government respects every family's choice and does its best to create a fair, harmonious environment and formulate pro-family policies that keep up with the times, to provide relevant support to families based on their needs."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01663,2022-04-05-T-019,1663,Sun Xueling,"The Government will also help women who have contributed to their families for many years and are approaching retirement age but have limited savings through schemes, such as the Home Caregiving Grant and Silver Support Scheme. Family members can also show their care for their loved ones by tapping on the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to help them save more for old age. These top-ups to their Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts are eligible for tax relief."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01664,2022-04-05-T-019,1664,Sun Xueling,"While the Government does step in to help families in need, we should not intervene in a manner that is too intrusive, such as to monetise the relationship between a couple through mandating a spousal allowance. This will cause spousal relationships to deteriorate, turning it into monetary transactions, with the Government acting as the arbiter."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01665,2022-04-05-T-019,1665,Sun Xueling,"Wives and housewives often say that they hope to be appreciated by their families and that their contributions should not be taken for granted. They also hope to be financially self-sufficient, to take care of their own needs in old age when they are unable to work, instead of relying on children who may need to take care of their own families."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01666,2022-04-05-T-019,1666,Sun Xueling,"I would like to urge all family members to fully recognise one another's contributions to the family, especially women who are wives and mothers, and to acknowledge and thank them for their hard work over the years. Besides expressing our appreciation, caring for and respecting family members, we can also consider topping up their CPF accounts which will be matched by the Government. This will give homemakers greater financial assurance for their future needs."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01667,2022-04-05-T-019,1667,Sun Xueling,"Together with contributions from the community and families, we can make Singapore a fairer and more inclusive society for our future generations."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01668,2022-04-05-T-019,1668,Sun Xueling,"(In English)  Lastly, I would like to address questions raised on elective egg freezing."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01669,2022-04-05-T-019,1669,Sun Xueling,"Since the announcement has gone out, I have received many emails from women who welcome the choice but are concerned about the age limit."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01670,2022-04-05-T-019,1670,Sun Xueling,"Miss Cheng Li Hui had also suggested to extend the age limit to 40 years old. The upper age limit of 35 years old is pegged to the existing age limits for donor eggs for Assisted Reproduction Treatment. Some ask why this is so since they are a woman's own eggs rather than a donor's eggs. The reason is because it is founded on similar current international scientific evidence and professional consensus, which is that egg quality tends to decline significantly after 35 years old. We are making a big move with regard to providing the choice of elective egg freezing."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01671,2022-04-05-T-019,1671,Sun Xueling,"The Government had taken time to study the issue because there are differing voices and views and concerns about elective egg freezing, such as whether we are encouraging women to put off marriage and parenthood when women face the hard truths and the scientific facts of the biological clock. The Government has the responsibility to let citizens know factually what the medical odds are of conceiving with frozen eggs."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01672,2022-04-05-T-019,1672,Sun Xueling,"According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the chance that a frozen egg will yield a baby currently stands at 2% to 12%. The further we push out the age range, the more the success rates fall. We have to be honest with our women because the procedure is invasive, it takes a toll on the women both physically and emotionally, and also costs the patient recurrent costs for storage."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01673,2022-04-05-T-019,1673,Sun Xueling,"But that said, we recognise Miss Cheng Li Hui's point that many women only start thinking about fertility and egg freezing in their 30s. I would like to assure Miss Cheng Li Hui and many who hold similar views that we will continue to monitor medical developments and international data. For women who missed the local criteria slightly and who wish to appeal, they may seek the Assisted Reproduction practitioner's assistance to appeal on their behalf. More details will be provided to the AR Centres in due course."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01674,2022-04-05-T-019,1674,Sun Xueling,"I agree with Miss Cheng Li Hui that, with more conversations, there is more awareness. I hope that this move to allow women to have the choice to freeze their eggs has also created some awareness and space for conversations about fertility health and cause women to think about these issues earlier."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01675,2022-04-05-T-019,1675,Sun Xueling,The Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships is also starting to raise awareness on this matter to encourage couples to discuss and check their fertility early. The Government is also looking into supporting couples with ready access to evidence-based fertility health information to empower them to make fertility decisions and seek help if needed.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01676,2022-04-05-T-019,1676,Sun Xueling,"Ms Janet Ang spoke about her concern that younger women will now choose to postpone childbearing. I would like to assure the Member and others who have similar concerns, that we will continue to encourage and support Singaporeans to fulfil their marriage and parenthood goals, and to do so early to increase the chances of conceiving naturally and reduce age-related fertility complications. To guard against misinformation, and to help women make an informed choice, women will have to undergo pre-procedure counselling. We will highlight the limitations, the risks involved and that aged parenthood has its own challenges."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01677,2022-04-05-T-019,1677,Sun Xueling,"In conclusion, the White Paper has, at its heart, the desire of the Government to continue working alongside the community and all stakeholders to support our women while empowering them with opportunities and solutions, regardless of the circumstances that they are in."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01678,2022-04-05-T-019,1678,Sun Xueling,"We are grateful for the diverse feedback received. And we have had to navigate trade-offs, balance concerns while identifying the best way forward. More importantly, it is time now for us to take action. Let us come together and work collectively to build a fairer and more inclusive society, where men and women partner each other as equals. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01679,2022-04-05-T-019,1679,Speaker,Minister Josephine Teo.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01680,2022-04-05-T-019,1680,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me start by thanking hon Members for their active participation and suggestions."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01681,2022-04-05-T-019,1681,Josephine Teo,"There has been a marathon debate, feels almost like childbirth, but with epidural. So, quite painless. Because, fortunately, support for the Motion is unanimous, whether from PAP or Opposition Members. And I want to thank the Workers' Party, the PSP for speaking in support, even if we may not agree on everything. This is surely a good outcome for women and for Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01682,2022-04-05-T-019,1682,Josephine Teo,"In my opening speech, I encouraged Members to focus on two key elements of the Motion being debated  how to catalyse further collective action; and how to realise greater equality of partnership between women and men. I appreciate all Members who spoke and for contributing their proposals."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01683,2022-04-05-T-019,1683,Josephine Teo,"On catalysing collective action, Members like Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Mr Abdul Samad highlighted the importance of tripartism. Ms Poh Li San emphasised the media's role in shifting mindsets and Mr Darryl David underscored the need for a whole-of-society approach to uplift women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01684,2022-04-05-T-019,1684,Josephine Teo,"On realising more equal partnerships, Members like Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Louis Chua highlighted the role of men in caregiving and how institutional arrangements must encourage it."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01685,2022-04-05-T-019,1685,Josephine Teo,My colleagues in Government have also responded to specific comments by Members.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01686,2022-04-05-T-019,1686,Josephine Teo,"On workplaces, the Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs will be implemented about two years from now."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01687,2022-04-05-T-019,1687,Josephine Teo,"To suggestions by Dr Wan Rizal, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Melvin Yong to bring it forward, Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has highlighted that, in fact, MOM will promote greater adoption of the existing tripartite standards to boost momentum for the eventual implementation of the guidelines. So, things are moving."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01688,2022-04-05-T-019,1688,Josephine Teo,"On protection against violence and harms, Ms Sylvia Lim made suggestions concerning family violence. Minister Shanmugam has outlined the holistic response that MHA is taking."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01689,2022-04-05-T-019,1689,Josephine Teo,"Responding to Ms Hany Soh and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Senior Minister of State Sim Ann has elaborated on how the Sunlight Alliance for Action will promote greater awareness of online harms and provide more holistic support to advocates in the community, as well as victims."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01690,2022-04-05-T-019,1690,Josephine Teo,"On support for caregivers, many Members, such as Miss Rachel Ong and Mr Vikram Nair, have welcomed the enhancement of the Home Caregiving Grant."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01691,2022-04-05-T-019,1691,Josephine Teo,"Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Sharael Taha and Ms Tin Pei Ling called on the Government to increase the capacity for respite care. In response, Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam shared MOH's commitment to make it more accessible and affordable."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01692,2022-04-05-T-019,1692,Josephine Teo,"To Mr Yip Hon Weng's suggestion, Minister of State Low Yen Ling shared how the Government is working with community partners to strengthen peer support networks to better support caregivers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01693,2022-04-05-T-019,1693,Josephine Teo,"On changing mindsets, we absolutely agree with Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Leon Perera, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Ms Carrie Tan that it is foundational. We also agree with Ms Janet Ang and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim that more women are ready today for leadership roles."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01694,2022-04-05-T-019,1694,Josephine Teo,"Minister Masagos Zulkifli has declared his support and his Ministry's active interventions on this front. At the same time, Minister Ong Ye Kung underscored society's collective duty."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01695,2022-04-05-T-019,1695,Josephine Teo,"Sir, even with extensive consultations and wide-ranging engagements, no White Paper or parliamentary debate on women's development can claim to have addressed all pertinent issues that Singaporeans care about."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01696,2022-04-05-T-019,1696,Josephine Teo,"Some questions take time to consider, like those raised by Ms Hazel Poa on mandating CPF top-ups for caregivers by their spouses or those by Miss Rachel Ong and Mr Gerald Giam on legislating parental or family care leave."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01697,2022-04-05-T-019,1697,Josephine Teo,"Other questions have no simple answers. For example, should paternity and maternity leave benefits be equalised to better reflect the desire for equal sharing of responsibilities between fathers and mothers in caring for their newborns?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01698,2022-04-05-T-019,1698,Josephine Teo,"But as Minister of State Sun Xueling has pointed out, societal norms constrain men from fully utilising existing leave provisions. More leave provided does not automatically lead to more leave taken. At which point would mindsets have shifted sufficiently such that the equal provision of parental leave would, in fact, result in the equal sharing of responsibilities?"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01699,2022-04-05-T-019,1699,Josephine Teo,"Questions like these should not be forgotten. Every now and then, we should revisit them. And even if we do not, Mr Louis Ng will make sure that we do. [Laughter.]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01700,2022-04-05-T-019,1700,Josephine Teo,"Like the subject of elective egg freezing, which Miss Cheng Li Hui championed for years, it takes time to develop deeper understanding and to build consensus on what is right for our women and our society. Likewise, for workplace fairness, which Labour Members of Parliament have actively championed and worked on the ground to achieve for years, new legislation builds on the steady gains we have already made to boost female employment in every age group."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01701,2022-04-05-T-019,1701,Josephine Teo,"Sir, by any measure, this White Paper and its 25 recommendations are a major milestone for our whole-of-nation approach to Singapore women's development. In fact, the White Paper distils the views of Singaporeans over the year-long conversations. As early as September last year, Prime Minister Lee had outlined its key recommendations."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01702,2022-04-05-T-019,1702,Josephine Teo,"Sir, this makes me a little puzzled to hear Ms He Ting Ru say there is not sufficient time to consider them. It also seems contrary to calls on the Government to move faster not on recommendations but on implementation."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01703,2022-04-05-T-019,1703,Josephine Teo,"This is because, when fully implemented, the White Paper promises to realise more closely our vision of a fairer and more inclusive society where men and women partner each other as equals and can pursue their aspirations freely and to the fullest."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01704,2022-04-05-T-019,1704,Josephine Teo,"In truth, advancing the cause of women's development is a journey without end. In every generation, we must find new ways to elevate women. We cross each new milestone in the hope of going further to reach the next."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01705,2022-04-05-T-019,1705,Josephine Teo,"As we commit ourselves to action, it is also worth asking what today's debate has achieved. I suggest to Members that its greatest contribution is in upholding the values we hold dear as a society and which will serve as our North Star as we seek out the next milestones in women's development."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01706,2022-04-05-T-019,1706,Josephine Teo,What are these values? The first and foremost has to be the equality of women and men.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01707,2022-04-05-T-019,1707,Josephine Teo,"History is replete with examples of women being subjugated by men. In ancient Athens, widely regarded as the birthplace of democracy, women received little education. They lived in their own quarters separate from men – maybe it is for their own protection – and were confined to household duties. Not that these were unimportant, but women were otherwise excluded in society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01708,2022-04-05-T-019,1708,Josephine Teo,"Even towards the end of the European Age of Enlightenment, French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that women did not need to be educated to the same extent as men since their main duty in life was to please their husbands and educate their sons."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01709,2022-04-05-T-019,1709,Josephine Teo,"Similar attitudes permeated Eastern tradition. Confucius had a famous saying, ""女子无才便是德"", meaning the lack of talent in a woman is a virtue."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01710,2022-04-05-T-019,1710,Josephine Teo,"It is clear from this debate that here, in modern-day Singapore, we firmly reject such narrow-mindedness towards women. Instead, we reaffirm the value of equality between women and men. No one is left in doubt that Singapore women should have equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations as much as men."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01711,2022-04-05-T-019,1711,Josephine Teo,"The tone of this debate has also upheld the value of partnership. Women should be regarded as equal partners of men not only at work but also at home. We believe that more for girls and women does not mean less for boys and men. Workplace fairness, FWAs and caregiver support benefit women as well as men. We aim to ensure that advances for one do not diminish the other. Instead, it strengthens boys and men when our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters are uplifted."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01712,2022-04-05-T-019,1712,Josephine Teo,"In a true partnership, both gain from each other's growth. This is the only sustainable way forward. In the same way, the partnership between the Government and the community at large has helped to bring about positive change for Singapore women."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01713,2022-04-05-T-019,1713,Josephine Teo,A third and essential value underpinning equality and partnership is that of mutual respect between men and women.
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01714,2022-04-05-T-019,1714,Josephine Teo,"As a society, we should respect women's place in it and honour their contributions. Equally, we respect men's choice and ability to support women in their capacities as fathers, husbands, brothers, bosses, colleagues and friends."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01715,2022-04-05-T-019,1715,Josephine Teo,"Mutual respect shapes our attitudes and beliefs about women and men. They reach the corners of our minds that laws, regulations, guidelines and practices will never fully reach. They determine the culture and norms within which we all live. They move our hearts and spur us to action so that supporting women is a ""want to do"" rather than ""have to do""."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01716,2022-04-05-T-019,1716,Josephine Teo,"At its core, respect means that women should not be exploited. Women should not be sidelined. Women should not be stereotyped. Rather, women deserve to be recognised for their contributions. Women deserve to be empowered to succeed. Women deserve to be respected as equal partners in society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01717,2022-04-05-T-019,1717,Josephine Teo,"These core values of equality, partnership and mutual respect must endure with every step we take in advancing women's interests. It is now up to us to put our values once again into action."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01718,2022-04-05-T-019,1718,Josephine Teo,"Sir, I would like to bring this debate to a close by returning to its core significance. More than anything else, this White Paper is about honouring Singapore women, recognising their place in society and committing to achieve further progress for women. Let me explain why in Mandarin."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01719,2022-04-05-T-019,1719,Josephine Teo,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Over the past decades, Singapore women have achieved exceptional progress in various fields. This White Paper is, therefore, about honouring Singapore women and recognising their place in society."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01720,2022-04-05-T-019,1720,Josephine Teo,"We honour them for fighting the battles to be seen and heard, recognised and valued. We honour them for their unyielding spirit that has led to many triumphs over adversity. We honour them for their unwavering commitment to blazing a trail and paving the way for other women to succeed."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01721,2022-04-05-T-019,1721,Josephine Teo,"The value of the White Paper goes beyond legislative and policy changes. Through a whole-of-nation plan of action, it aims to achieve further progress for Singapore women by putting the values we hold dear into action."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01722,2022-04-05-T-019,1722,Josephine Teo,"At its core, the White Paper seeks to build a fairer and more inclusive society where Singapore women, partnering men as equals, with mutual respect, can pursue and fulfil their aspirations freely and fully."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01723,2022-04-05-T-019,1723,Josephine Teo,"(In English)  Sir, at the start of the debate, I described my own struggles as a working woman, highlighting the men who were my staunchest allies  my husband, my father, father in-law, my brothers, my bosses and my colleagues."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01724,2022-04-05-T-019,1724,Josephine Teo,"Equally, many women in my life have been instrumental."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01725,2022-04-05-T-019,1725,Josephine Teo,"My popo, a widow from the time she was in her late 30s, began to educate me well before I started school. Riding on a little trishaw in Joo Chiat to visit her former midwife and her relatives, popo pointed to all the signboards on the shops that we passed to teach me to recognise Chinese characters."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01726,2022-04-05-T-019,1726,Josephine Teo,"Thanks to popo's spirit of adventure, I served as her English-speaking travel guide on trips abroad and cultivated my own curiosity about the world. I remember filling all the immigration forms. That is how you learn English. Not too bad a way."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01727,2022-04-05-T-019,1727,Josephine Teo,"My mother, a former Police officer, held court at work and at home. She is not one to easily take no for an answer nor will she ever retreat to helplessness in any situation. Because of mom, I learnt how to juggle my studies, my passion for basketball as well as preparing meals daily for my younger brothers."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01728,2022-04-05-T-019,1728,Josephine Teo,"My mother-in-law, who had raised seven children on a shoe string and cared for half a dozen more grandchildren, graciously helped with our late additions when they arrived. Without her support in those critical first years, I would easily have given up."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01729,2022-04-05-T-019,1729,Josephine Teo,"My twin daughters, whose wide-eyed wonder and joyful encouragement, inspired mommy to finally get a driver's licence."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01730,2022-04-05-T-019,1730,Josephine Teo,"My reliable helper of 23 years whom I always introduced as ""the children's real mother"", won her 10-year fight against breast cancer and is still with us."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01731,2022-04-05-T-019,1731,Josephine Teo,"Khoo Seok Lin, Director of Planning in EDB in the 1990s, who stuck her neck out to recommend a scholarship for me because she believed there was room in the organisation for both me and the only other scholarship recipient that year – a man."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01732,2022-04-05-T-019,1732,Josephine Teo,"Shirley Chen and Anna Chan who, as my bosses, showed how women can assert our views with conviction and grace."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01733,2022-04-05-T-019,1733,Josephine Teo,"My personal assistants (PAs) and security officers at different times – Patricia, Alice, Wendy, Chris, Jeya, Alicia, Eunice, Iris, Jocelyn, Silver and Charlene. I am so blessed to have them in my life because they make every day better for me."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01734,2022-04-05-T-019,1734,Josephine Teo,"My best friends forever since childhood, my newfound sisters in the Labour Movement and PAP Women's Wing, with whom I share laughter and tears."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01735,2022-04-05-T-019,1735,Josephine Teo,"Sir, at its core, the White Paper is about enabling all the women around us to be the best that they can be so that we, in turn, empower one another as role models, as teachers and mentors, as advocates and champions, as helpers and supporters."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01736,2022-04-05-T-019,1736,Josephine Teo,"Years later, when we look back, it is the fact of so many more stories to tell, so many more women to honour, that we know today's efforts have borne fruit. Years later, when we look back, it is the fact of so many more collective actions, so many more ground-up initiatives, that we see the power of alignment in hearts and minds towards the common cause of women's development."
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01737,2022-04-05-T-019,1737,Josephine Teo,"Years later, when we look back, this must be a moment to celebrate, because we leaned forward to achieve greater progress for Singapore women, we put our values into action once again and jointly ushered in a new dawn, leading to a fairer and more inclusive society, where more women partner men as equals, fulfil more of our aspirations freely and fully! Mr Speaker, I beg to move. [Applause.]"
2022-04-05-T-019-S-01738,2022-04-05-T-019,1738,Josephine Teo,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2022-04-05-T-020-S-01742,2022-04-05-T-020,1742,,Adjourned accordingly at 10.02 pm.
2022-04-05-T-021-S-01743,2022-04-05-T-021,1743,Yeo Wan Ling,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry has measured the effectiveness of (i) the National Dengue Prevention Campaign and (ii) the frequency of enforcement agent checks on HDB corridors, drains and other common estate areas for mosquito breeding."
2022-04-05-T-021-S-01744,2022-04-05-T-021,1744,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) adopts a holistic dengue control strategy to keep dengue incidence low, by keeping the mosquito population low and breaking the disease transmission chain. This includes outreach and engagement, as well as regular inspections of various premises for mosquito breeding sites."
2022-04-05-T-021-S-01745,2022-04-05-T-021,1745,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Dengue Prevention Campaign is NEA’s key outreach and engagement programme on dengue. The annual programme rallies the community to stop dengue transmission, to prevent a surge in dengue cases ahead of the traditional dengue peak period, typically from June to October. NEA carries out post-campaign surveys to measure the effectiveness of the campaign and gather insights on the public’s perception of dengue prevention. The survey results, generally, show that the campaign has been effective in raising awareness on dengue prevention. NEA uses the survey findings and insights to sharpen and improve future campaigns."
2022-04-05-T-021-S-01746,2022-04-05-T-021,1746,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA utilises daily dengue case data and mosquito population data collected from gravitraps fortnightly, to identify high risk areas. This allows NEA to prioritise mosquito breeding inspections and ensure effective deployment of limited manpower resources. As such, high-risk areas, which may include HDB estates, would be inspected more frequently. In 2021, NEA conducted about 631,000 inspections for mosquito breeding islandwide, including residential units, construction sites, common areas within the HDB estates, and public areas in landed estates, using this targeted inspection regime. This uncovered about 18,500 mosquito breeding habitats."
2022-04-05-T-022-S-01747,2022-04-05-T-022,1747,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Manpower in light of findings that have shown a correlation between prolonged telecommuting work arrangements and its impact on workers’ health such as dry eye disease and increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders, from poor work environment at home (a) whether the Ministry will study if such health issues are occurring more frequently among our local workforce; and (b) whether the Work Injury Compensation Act should then be amended to include these new health issues as occupational diseases."
2022-04-05-T-022-S-01748,2022-04-05-T-022,1748,Tan See Leng,"Based on claims that have been filed, there is no indication of the effect of prolonged telecommuting work arrangements on work-related musculoskeletal disorders or eye disorders. In fact, the top sectoral contributors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders in 2021 and 2020 were manufacturing, health and social services, accommodation and food services, and construction. Workers in these sectors, generally, do not telecommute due to the nature of their work. For dry eye disease, it is compensable if it arose out of and in the course of employment. However, we note that dry eye disease has also been linked to several non-work factors, such as ageing or vitamin deficiency. We will continue to monitor workplace trends and medical evidence and review the list of occupational diseases under the Work Injury Compensation Act when necessary."
2022-04-05-T-022-S-01749,2022-04-05-T-022,1749,Tan See Leng,"In addition, with telecommuting becoming more prevalent, the Workplace Safety and Health Council has been conducting outreach to employers and employees on safe and healthy telecommuting practices. The Council has published a bulletin on conducting risk assessment when working from home. These include mitigating ergonomic hazards, such as by adjusting monitor height to prevent eye or neck strain, and taking regular screen breaks to rest one’s eyes at least two to three times every hour."
2022-04-05-T-023-S-01750,2022-04-05-T-023,1750,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how much of Singapore’s total carbon emissions are attributable to industries situated in Jurong Island; and (b) what are the targets for the abatement of emissions from these industries.
2022-04-05-T-023-S-01751,2022-04-05-T-023,1751,Gan Kim Yong,Around one-third of carbon emissions are direct emissions from the refining and petrochemicals sector which accounts for the majority of industrial emissions from Jurong Island.
2022-04-05-T-023-S-01752,2022-04-05-T-023,1752,Gan Kim Yong,The Sustainable Jurong Island report outlines our plans to transform Jurong Island into a Sustainable Energy and Chemicals Park and includes 2050 targets to achieve more than six million tonnes per annum of carbon abatement through the adoption of low-carbon solutions and to increase the output of sustainable products by four times from 2019 levels.
2022-04-05-T-023-S-01753,2022-04-05-T-023,1753,Gan Kim Yong,"Global companies in the refining and petrochemicals sector have also set climate targets to achieve net-zero by mid-century. Many of them have significant operations on Jurong Island. The Government is working closely with such companies on transiting to a low-carbon future. For example, EDB is supporting Sumitomo Chemical in exploring technologies to convert captured CO2 to chemicals."
2022-04-05-T-024-S-01754,2022-04-05-T-024,1754,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the approval of Novavax's Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine in Singapore for the national vaccination programme (a) whether there are any plans to allow for voluntary selection of Nuvaxovid as a vaccine, instead of mRNA vaccines; and (b) whether there are any plans to allow for voluntary selection of Nuvaxovid for those aged 12 to 17, given the positive results of trials for this age group and the severe restrictions still in place for selection of Sinovac-CoronaVac."
2022-04-05-T-024-S-01755,2022-04-05-T-024,1755,Ong Ye Kung,"Based on current practice, when Nuvaxovid is made available in Singapore as a vaccine under the National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, individuals can exercise choice of vaccine, so long as usage is in accordance with the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination."
2022-04-05-T-024-S-01756,2022-04-05-T-024,1756,Ong Ye Kung,"While Novavax had announced that the vaccine was found to be 80% effective against COVID-19 in a late-stage trial in adolescents aged 12 to 17 when the Delta variant was dominant, the company has not applied for the use of vaccine for persons under 18 years. The Health Sciences Authority and EC19V will evaluate the data from this study and will continue to monitor for more information on the efficacy and safety of Novavax’s Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine before making the appropriate recommendations for this age group."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01757,2022-04-05-T-025,1757,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the sectoral breakdown of the number of jobseekers who have been successfully hired through the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) in 2019, 2020 and 2021; (b) how successful have the PCPs been in directing Singaporean workers away from sunset industries and into growing industries; and (c) how can the PCP initiative be further enhanced so as to direct labour efficiently amidst rapid industry disruptions and unforeseen shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01758,2022-04-05-T-025,1758,Tan See Leng,"Since August 2021, Workforce Singapore (WSG) has rebranded the Professional Conversion Programmes to Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) to reflect their broad coverage across the range of occupations."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01759,2022-04-05-T-025,1759,Tan See Leng,"Over the last three years, there were more than 24,000 locals placed into new jobs through CCPs. This is 62% higher than the previous three years. The top sectors for CCP placements over the past three years are Air Transport, Financial Services and General Manufacturing, but this changes from year to year."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01760,2022-04-05-T-025,1760,Tan See Leng,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether the CCPs have been successful in directing workers away from sunset industries into growth industries. Our approach is to focus on jobs rather than sectors as jobs across all industries are being transformed and new jobs created. The CCPs serve two main functions. Firstly, where there are emerging new jobs, or demand for skilled workers, WSG offers place-and-train CCPs to support employers to hire mid-career workers and provide them with the necessary training to do these jobs."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01761,2022-04-05-T-025,1761,Tan See Leng,"Secondly, we are moving upstream to reskill workers in at-risk job roles. WSG works with progressive employers to reskill at-risk workers and redeploy them into new or redesigned jobs within the company, instead of letting these workers go. About 11,000 workers were reskilled and redeployed through what we call redeployment CCPs over the last three years. Taken together, WSG offers a wide variety of CCPs – around 100 CCPs across 30 sectors."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01762,2022-04-05-T-025,1762,Tan See Leng,"As for measuring success, I am happy to report that most of our CCP participants do well. About nine in 10 CCP participants remained employed 24 months after embarking on the programme, and about six in 10 earned more than their last drawn salaries, reflecting the value of the skills acquired."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01763,2022-04-05-T-025,1763,Tan See Leng,Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked how we can enhance the CCPs to respond effectively to industry disruptions.
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01764,2022-04-05-T-025,1764,Tan See Leng,"Firstly, our CCPs are highly customisable and can be deployed quickly. During the COVID-19 pandemic, WSG worked closely with the Food Services, Retail and Hotels sectors to roll out CCPs to help companies in these adversely impacted sectors redeploy and reskill more than 3,000 of their existing workers. This is how we were able to rapidly scale up in 2020."
2022-04-05-T-025-S-01765,2022-04-05-T-025,1765,Tan See Leng,"Secondly, MTI and our sector agencies are driving our economic transformation through the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). To complement the ITM effort, MOM launched the Jobs Transformation Maps (JTMs) in 2021 to provide detailed, job-level insights on the impact of technology and automation on the industry and workforce. The JTMs will serve as a useful compass for industry, employers and workers to prepare themselves for future jobs and skills. With these insights, WSG works closely with the sector agencies to mount CCPs to support the longer-term manpower needs of our economy."
2022-04-05-T-026-S-01766,2022-04-05-T-026,1766,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many cases of COVID-19 reinfections have been detected in Singapore since November 2021; (b) whether there are any significant differences in healthcare outcomes for re-infected patients in Singapore; (c) what proportion of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU are re-infected patients; and (d) what is the demographic breakdown of COVID-19 reinfection cases.
2022-04-05-T-026-S-01767,2022-04-05-T-026,1767,Ong Ye Kung,"From 1 November 2021 to 25 March 2022, 8,845 cases of reinfection were detected in Singapore. The vast majority of reinfection cases are mild, with one case requiring ICU admission and two deaths reported. The majority of reinfection cases are below 60 years of age."
2022-04-05-T-027-S-01768,2022-04-05-T-027,1768,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many people have been caught with a forged Singapore identity card (IC) or a forged Singapore passport in the past three years; (b) whether there is a rising trend of such cases; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to tackle the rise in forged ICs and passports which are being offered on anonymous messaging applications such as Telegram.
2022-04-05-T-027-S-01769,2022-04-05-T-027,1769,K Shanmugam,"From 2019 to 2021, the number of persons convicted for the possession of forged identity cards and forged passports was 51 and five respectively. There has not been a rising trend of such cases."
2022-04-05-T-027-S-01770,2022-04-05-T-027,1770,K Shanmugam,"The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, or ICA, monitors online platforms for possible abuse of ICA-issued documents. It is aware of chat groups on online messaging platforms which advertise the sale of forged ICs and passports. ICA will take enforcement action wherever possible."
2022-04-05-T-027-S-01771,2022-04-05-T-027,1771,K Shanmugam,Anyone with information on persons or platforms claiming to sell forged documents may also inform ICA through its website.
2022-04-05-T-027-S-01772,2022-04-05-T-027,1772,K Shanmugam,"ICA would like to remind the public that the possession of forged ICs and passports are offences under the National Registration Act and Passports Act respectively. If convicted, offenders are liable for a fine not exceeding $10,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both."
2022-04-05-T-028-S-01773,2022-04-05-T-028,1773,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Transport given the safety concerns of families with young children or elderly persons, what measures are in place to minimise the number of heavy vehicles that are using roads located within HDB neighbourhoods to transit through, where the vehicle origin and destination are not within the HDB town itself."
2022-04-05-T-028-S-01774,2022-04-05-T-028,1774,S Iswaran,"Heavy vehicles typically use roads that serve industrial areas and would, generally, keep away from residential areas. However, school buses, refuse trucks and goods delivery vehicles still need to ply roads in residential areas to serve residents’ needs."
2022-04-05-T-028-S-01775,2022-04-05-T-028,1775,S Iswaran,"There are also occasions when heavy vehicles use residential roads to access construction sites. In such instances, LTA works with the relevant agencies and contractors to determine the appropriate routes and put in place measures, such as warning signs and impose conditions, such as reducing the speed limit, to mitigate traffic impact and safety risks. LTA also requires contractors to deploy traffic marshals where road works result in a shared right of way, for example, when a bi-directional road is made to share a single lane, or when they affect traffic junctions."
2022-04-05-T-028-S-01776,2022-04-05-T-028,1776,S Iswaran,"To further enhance the safety of young children and elderly persons near schools and in residential areas with more senior citizens, LTA has introduced School Zones and Silver Zones. Measures adopted in these zones include a reduced speed limit of either 30 kilometres per hour or 40 kilometres per hour, and the construction of speed humps and traffic calming markings to slow down vehicles."
2022-04-05-T-029-S-01777,2022-04-05-T-029,1777,Abdul Samad,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of organisations that are successful in applying for the Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant (SW EAG) and the Part-time Re-employment Grant (PTRG) since they were introduced; and (b) whether there is any particular trend, in terms of types of industry and occupation, where the number of successful applicants of these grants is higher than the national average."
2022-04-05-T-029-S-01778,2022-04-05-T-029,1778,Tan See Leng,"From 1 July 2020 to 31 January 2022, more than 3,800  companies and 2,800"
2022-04-05-T-029-S-01779,2022-04-05-T-029,1779,Tan See Leng,"MOM has observed higher application rates for the grants from the manufacturing, administrative and support services, as well as the accommodation and food services sectors. We do not collect data on the occupations of the senior workers working in the companies that have applied for the grants."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01780,2022-04-05-T-030,1780,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) over the past 10 years, how many cases of injury and death by electrocution have taken place in HDB flats; (b) what proportion of these incidents has involved an electrical circuit that has been protected and unprotected by the residual current circuit breaker (RCCB) respectively; (c) how many HDB flats currently do not have RCCB protection covering the entire unit; and (d) what is being done to improve electrical safety for residents."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01781,2022-04-05-T-030,1781,Desmond Lee,"From 2014 to end-2021, there have been four separate electrocution incidents taking place in HDB flats, involving five deaths and one injury. HDB does not have data of such incidents prior to 2014. Of the four cases, one involved an electrical circuit without RCCB and two electrical circuits with faulty circuit-breakers."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01782,2022-04-05-T-030,1782,Desmond Lee,"Flats built before 1985, which comprise about 30% of our current HDB housing stock, were provided with fuses. RCCBs became a requirement from 1985 and this applied to new homes (including HDB flats) built on or after 1985 as well as older homes (including flats) that underwent substantive renovations. Over the years, most of these flats, which are close to 40 years old, would have undergone renovations, would likely have had their electrical circuit rewired and installed with RCCBs, in line with the regulatory requirements. Based on a sample survey of about 1,800 HDB flats built before 1985, it is estimated that less than 1% of such flats do not have RCCB protection covering the entire unit."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01783,2022-04-05-T-030,1783,Desmond Lee,"To ensure electrical safety in residential premises, including HDB flats, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) regulates electrical installations in Singapore via the Electricity (Electrical Installations) Regulations. These regulations require all electrical works, such as the installation of electrical wiring and RCCBs, to be undertaken by a licensed electrical worker (LEW). The regulations also require the LEW to ensure that the electrical works meet the industry technical and safety requirements and standards."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01784,2022-04-05-T-030,1784,Desmond Lee,"After the completion of the electrical installations, the LEW is required to apply to SP Group for inspection and testing of the installations. This is to ensure that they have been installed correctly and are safe and fit for operation, before the electricity supply can be turned on."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01785,2022-04-05-T-030,1785,Desmond Lee,"Since August 2020, HDB has included the option to rewire non-compliant water heaters for flats undergoing the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). HDB has also advised flat owners to replace RCCBs which are found faulty during HIP. For HIP projects tendered in 2020 under the new extended HIP, HDB has included the checking and replacement of faulty RCCBs."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01786,2022-04-05-T-030,1786,Desmond Lee,"EMA also conducts periodic educational campaigns on electrical safety, in partnership with agencies, such as HDB and Enterprise Singapore (ESG). For example, in July 2021, EMA sent out information leaflets in utility bills to remind homeowners to test their RCCBs. Flat owners should check that their entire flat is protected by RCCB and test their RCCBs regularly to ensure the safety of electrical circuits, especially in older homes. Flat owners can contact HDB should they need help in locating their RCCB and finding electrical contractors whom they can engage for the checks."
2022-04-05-T-030-S-01787,2022-04-05-T-030,1787,Desmond Lee,HDB will continue to work with EMA on efforts to raise awareness and improve electrical safety for HDB residents.
2022-04-05-T-031-S-01788,2022-04-05-T-031,1788,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Health for each year in the past five years, what are the mean and median overtime hours worked per month per nurse and per doctor respectively."
2022-04-05-T-031-S-01789,2022-04-05-T-031,1789,Ong Ye Kung,MOH does not track the data for overtime hours for doctors and nurses. These are operational arrangements by the healthcare clusters and involve exigencies of service.
2022-04-05-T-031-S-01790,2022-04-05-T-031,1790,Ong Ye Kung,"Nevertheless, we acknowledge the hard work and effort put in by all our healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis, the pressure on our healthcare workers has increased tremendously. This is especially so over the last few months, because, due to the Omicron variant, all healthcare workers have put in an exceptional amount of extra effort and hours to take care of patients and keep our healthcare system running. Even before the pandemic, our healthcare workers have been the backbone supporting our healthcare system and enabling us to strengthen and increase our healthcare capacity over the past decade."
2022-04-05-T-031-S-01791,2022-04-05-T-031,1791,Ong Ye Kung,"As we now, hopefully, turn the corner from the current wave of COVID-19, our public healthcare clusters will do our best to allow staff the opportunity to rest and recharge and take vacation days and annual leave whenever possible."
2022-04-05-T-032-S-01792,2022-04-05-T-032,1792,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB flats are fitted with residual current circuit breaker (RCCB) that do not protect the whole unit; and (b) whether these flats will be upgraded to provide circuit breaker protection for the whole unit.

2022-04-05-T-033-S-01799,2022-04-05-T-033,1799,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what additional steps has the Ministry taken to help social workers following the report that nearly six in 10 frontline social workers are affected by anxiety at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
2022-04-05-T-033-S-01800,2022-04-05-T-033,1800,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF recognises that the nature of work in the social service sector can take its toll on social workers, affecting their mental and emotional well-being. This is particularly so with the higher workload and uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As Singapore moves towards living with COVID-19 and Safe Management Measures are eased, the demand for social services is likely to normalise and the stress levels of social workers, gradually, eased to a more normal level."
2022-04-05-T-033-S-01801,2022-04-05-T-033,1801,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) have been engaging Social Service Agencies (SSAs) on an ongoing basis to raise awareness of the importance of organisational support for their employees’ mental well-being and to develop a culture of self-care. We have also worked closely with social work leaders on balancing staff well-being with maintaining service delivery standards. Given the impact of the pandemic, these efforts have been ramped up in the past two years."
2022-04-05-T-033-S-01802,2022-04-05-T-033,1802,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to the National Care Hotline which provides emotional and psychological support to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, NCSS launched the Caring for Social Service Professionals Scheme in May 2021 to support SSAs in promoting staff well-being. The scheme provides co-funding of up to 90% (capped at $2,000 per SSA) for SSAs to offer professional counselling services to their staff. To date, 63 SSAs, which employ over 12,000 professionals, are on board the scheme."
2022-04-05-T-033-S-01803,2022-04-05-T-033,1803,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Social service professionals can access self-care and coping strategies, through subsidised courses offered by the Social Service Institute (SSI) under NCSS. New social workers joining the social service sector can also tap on the Singapore Association of Social Workers’ mentoring programme where they will be matched with an experienced social worker to receive support and guidance. Furthermore, in-sector social workers can apply for the Sabbatical Leave Scheme supported by NCSS and the VWOs-Charities Capability Fund (VCF). The Sabbatical Leave Scheme provides seasoned social service professionals, including social workers, with paid leave and a Professional Advancement Sponsorship, to recharge themselves and develop their professional competencies."
2022-04-05-T-033-S-01804,2022-04-05-T-033,1804,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF and NCSS will continue to raise awareness on the existing schemes available to support social workers. We will also work with our tripartite partners in the social service sector to address feedback from our social workers, through the Social Service SkillsFuture Tripartite Taskforce. Comprising SSAs, Institutes of Higher Learning, professional bodies and Government agencies, the task force will be extended for an additional term until April 2025 to consult and continue co-creating initiatives to strengthen the system of support for sector professionals, including social workers."

2022-04-05-T-035-S-01809,2022-04-05-T-035,1809,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"A climate change public perception survey conducted by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) in 2019 found that 90% of Singapore residents are aware of climate change and its impact, while close to 80% are prepared to do more to fight climate change. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have been focusing our public education and engagement efforts on three fronts  (a) generating greater public awareness on sustainability measures; (b) fostering understanding of new green opportunities and the trade-offs and costs involved; and, most importantly, (c) galvanising collective action to combat climate change."
2022-04-05-T-035-S-01810,2022-04-05-T-035,1810,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Green Plan Ministries have been holding discussions with the public and key stakeholders on various sustainability topics, including our net-zero emissions ambition. In fact, in the last two weeks, we have held two Green Plan Conversations on the Resilient Future and Sustainable Living pillars. These Conversations aim to increase understanding of climate change impacts and Green Plan initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Through these Conversations, we seek to garner support and collective action for the Green Plan. Such dialogues to engage various stakeholder groups will continue to be organised."
2022-04-05-T-035-S-01811,2022-04-05-T-035,1811,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"MOE is also actively nurturing our students to learn, practise and contribute to a sustainable Singapore. Environmental sustainability is now integrated into our education institutions — in curriculum, campus infrastructure, institution culture and practices, and ongoing partnerships with the community."
2022-04-05-T-035-S-01812,2022-04-05-T-035,1812,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have also been working with citizens and partners to co-create policies and solutions as well as catalyse ground-up projects. For example, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) convened a Citizens’ Workgroup to co-create solutions to increase demand for local produce, to enhance our food security. One of the Workgroup’s recommendations was to create meals using local produce to increase awareness of their availability, freshness and nutritional value. The Workgroup participants went on to partner SFA, a chef and Thomson Medical to design meals for new mothers using local produce, which are accompanied by educational material. The pilot LoveSGMums Meal project was launched last month. Another example is our collaboration with Mediacorp on the CNA Green Plan to highlight key challenges brought about by climate change, to inspire individuals to go green. The collaboration included a series of public engagement activities and challenges, and a five-part infotainment series which was launched yesterday, on 4 April 2022."
2022-04-05-T-035-S-01813,2022-04-05-T-035,1813,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the coming year, we will continue to rally and mobilise individuals, the community, and businesses to start their own sustainability efforts and to do their part for the Singapore Green Plan."
2022-04-05-T-036-S-01814,2022-04-05-T-036,1814,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the time taken from the start of the school year before a primary one student receives his or her student concession card; and (b) whether the Ministry can shorten the time taken, especially for lower-income students, to lighten the financial burden on their families."
2022-04-05-T-036-S-01815,2022-04-05-T-036,1815,Chan Chun Sing,"All Primary 1 students receive their student concession card by 31 March of the year. The cards are printed and issued by Transit Link Pte Ltd after the photo-taking exercises that take place in January and February each year. Once received, the student concession card can be used by students for concessionary travel on public transport."
2022-04-05-T-036-S-01816,2022-04-05-T-036,1816,Chan Chun Sing,"Prior to the receipt of their student concession cards, Primary 1 students can still enjoy free travel on public transport if they have a child concession card. This is valid till 30 April of the year the child turns seven years old. The child concession card is issued on-site at any TransitLink Ticket Office upon application. Students can access MOE’s financial assistance schemes, regardless of whether they have the student concession card."
2022-04-05-T-037-S-01817,2022-04-05-T-037,1817,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Transport in view of COE premiums reaching near record high (a) what is the Government doing to mitigate the increase in rental and transport costs for those who drive or travel by private-hire cars; (b) under what circumstances will Government intervention be warranted; (c) what intervention measures are being planned; and (d) whether the Ministry plans to review the COE bidding system to reduce speculative bidding.
2022-04-05-T-037-S-01818,2022-04-05-T-037,1818,S Iswaran,Private hire car (PHC) rental costs have not increased despite higher Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums as the ownership costs of cars already in service remain unchanged.
2022-04-05-T-037-S-01819,2022-04-05-T-037,1819,S Iswaran,"The Government does not regulate PHC fares or rental costs, which are determined by dynamic market forces. This allows demand and supply for PHC services and rentals to be matched efficiently based on prevailing market conditions, while spurring service improvements and price competitiveness. Similarly, the COE is market-based, where premiums are determined by market forces of supply and demand."
2022-04-05-T-037-S-01820,2022-04-05-T-037,1820,S Iswaran,"LTA has no plans to review the COE rules which, in general, discourage speculative bidding. For example, Category A and B COEs for cars are non-transferable. Only the successful bidder can use the temporary COE (TCOE) to register a vehicle. Further, a deposit of $10,000 will need to be placed when bidding. This bid deposit is forfeited if the temporary COE (TCOE) is not used for registration within the validity period. LTA will continue to monitor the situation on the ground closely."
2022-04-05-T-038-S-01821,2022-04-05-T-038,1821,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry conducts service planning to determine the number of clinics that offer Swab and Send Home (SASH) service for each residential area; (b) whether the ratio is different for estates with a high concentration of senior residents and low-income residents and, if so, how is the ratio different; and (c) what is the Ministry’s approach to encourage higher SASH sign-up rates by clinics in areas that are projected to require more SASH utilisation."
2022-04-05-T-038-S-01822,2022-04-05-T-038,1822,Ong Ye Kung,"To manage the COVID-19 pandemic, we encourage all clinics to join the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) scheme and the Swab-and-Send-Home (SASH) programme. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) also reaches out to support clinics with onboarding. However, there are some clinics that are not suitable to be on the SASH programme due to factors such as infrastructural and/or manpower constraints, for example, need for dedicated swabbing area."
2022-04-05-T-038-S-01823,2022-04-05-T-038,1823,Ong Ye Kung,"MOH and AIC have engaged and onboarded over 900 PHPCs that offer Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swabs and/or Antigen Rapid Tests (ART). These PHPCs are located islandwide, with an average of around 20 such clinics within each town."
2022-04-05-T-038-S-01824,2022-04-05-T-038,1824,Ong Ye Kung,"To further enhance the accessibility of these tests in the community, MOH has also introduced COVID-19 testing facilities for various test purposes, including 224 Quick Test Centres (QTCs) providing ART and 11 Combined Test Centres (CTC) providing ART and PCR. In addition, all polyclinics provide COVID-19 PCR and ART swab tests for their patients. For home-bound clients, there are also more than 20 home care providers that can provide PCR tests if they require such tests."
2022-04-05-T-038-S-01825,2022-04-05-T-038,1825,Ong Ye Kung,"As the COVID-19 situation evolves, MOH will continue to work closely with the COVID-19 testing providers to ensure that the necessary testing resources are in place and accessible to all."
2022-04-05-T-039-S-01826,2022-04-05-T-039,1826,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has studied how floorboards of commercial lorries used to ferry workers can be strengthened for seat belts to be effective in the event of an accident similar to what is done for school buses; (b) if so, what are the findings and whether such findings can be made public; and (c) if such a study has not been conducted, whether the Ministry will conduct such a study."
2022-04-05-T-039-S-01827,2022-04-05-T-039,1827,S Iswaran,"LTA has consulted the industry and academia on various proposals, including strengthening the floorboard of the lorries’ carriage deck for seat belts."
2022-04-05-T-039-S-01828,2022-04-05-T-039,1828,S Iswaran,"The original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) shared that the retrofitting of seats, seat belts and reinforcements required for the floorboards may compromise the structural integrity of the lorry. In addition, the vehicle’s dynamics will be altered and this can affect the lorry’s stability when turning. These create new safety risks. There are also liability issues as the OEMs do not support and vouch for the safety of such lorries retrofitted with seatbelts. These findings are consistent with those from the previous tripartite review in 2008 on lorry transportation that retrofitting seat belts in the rear decks of lorries could result in other safety risks."
2022-04-05-T-040-S-01829,2022-04-05-T-040,1829,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the Call-for-Collaboration (CFC) for the Pilot Deployment of Autonomous Buses and Shuttles in Singapore that was jointly launched by LTA and EDB, in which the submission of CFC proposal had closed on 31 July 2019; and (b) when will the pilot deployment of autonomous buses and on-demand shuttles be implemented in Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District."
2022-04-05-T-040-S-01830,2022-04-05-T-040,1830,S Iswaran,LTA and EDB are negotiating with shortlisted consortia following their submissions for the pilot deployment of Autonomous Vehicle (AVs) under a Call-for-Collaboration (CFC).
2022-04-05-T-040-S-01831,2022-04-05-T-040,1831,S Iswaran,"Upon award, the successful consortia will need time to develop the technology and prepare for the pilot deployment at the shortlisted location(s) – to ensure public safety and minimise risks. LTA and the selected consortia will also engage the local community leaders before finalising any deployment."
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01832,2022-04-05-T-041,1832,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Manpower what are the safeguards being put in place under the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) to ensure that potential employment pass applicants are not abusing the system by circumventing the minimum requirements.
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01833,2022-04-05-T-041,1833,Tan See Leng,"We share the Member’s interest in safeguarding the integrity of the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) and preventing any abuse. I had covered a few aspects of how we will do so during MOM’s Committee of Supply debate in March 2022, but will reiterate these points for a holistic answer."
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01834,2022-04-05-T-041,1834,Tan See Leng,"Today, MOM takes a multi-pronged approach in enforcing our work pass requirements. Enforcement measures are already in place to guard against fraud in the areas of salary and qualifications, which are components of our current Employment Pass (EP) framework. MOM has screening capabilities to detect cases of fraud, including through data analytics and verification checks. This helps to sieve out fraudulent applications upstream, such as those who falsify salary or qualifications information. Downstream, we also conduct proactive checks to identify employers and work pass holders who breach our rules, for example, employers who declare a higher salary to meet work pass requirements but pay employees less than the declared amount. Some of these cases are surfaced by whistle-blowers while others are detected through audits and inspections."
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01835,2022-04-05-T-041,1835,Tan See Leng,"MOM imposes stiff penalties on errant employers and work pass holders. Offenders may be prosecuted for false declaration under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, which carries a fine of up to $20,000, up to two years’ imprisonment, or both, per charge. In addition, MOM will revoke the work passes of errant work pass holders and permanently bar them from employment in Singapore. In cases where employers are complicit, they may also have their work pass privileges suspended."
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01836,2022-04-05-T-041,1836,Tan See Leng,"When COMPASS is introduced, it will take into account a wider set of individual- and firm-related attributes to assess an applicant’s complementarity. To ensure that COMPASS is effective, MOM will, similarly, put in place strong enforcement measures to ensure that employers do not circumvent its rules."
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01837,2022-04-05-T-041,1837,Tan See Leng,"To ensure the authenticity of qualifications, MOM currently requires the submission of verification proof from a third-party screening organisation for selected work pass applications. Applications with unaccredited or false qualifications are rejected. With the introduction of COMPASS, where qualifications directly contribute to an application’s score, we are reviewing the need for mandatory verification of qualifications declared in applications and will share more details in due course."
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01838,2022-04-05-T-041,1838,Tan See Leng,We will also put in place verification checks to ensure that candidates claiming bonus points for the Shortage Occupation List are genuinely performing the job role in shortage. Candidates that relied on these bonus points to pass COMPASS will be issued an occupation-restricted EP. Their employers will also need to notify MOM if these EP holders need to be redeployed to a different job role and the eligibility of the EP holders will be reassessed. MOM will take enforcement action if an employer is found to have deployed such EP holders in unrelated roles.
2022-04-05-T-041-S-01839,2022-04-05-T-041,1839,Tan See Leng,"COMPASS is a significant move for MOM. I would like to assure Members that we will spare no effort to implement COMPASS well. MOM will always be on guard against actions that undermine our work pass framework and will continually refine our enforcement measures to ward off any abuse. I also urge all companies to work with MOM to achieve the objectives of COMPASS – uplifting foreign workforce complementarity and diversity, while building up the local workforce. In the long run, this is the only way to sustain broad support for an open and connected economy."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01840,2022-04-05-T-042,1840,He Ting Ru,"asked the Prime Minister what measures are being taken to address any concerns about diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and background in the top levels of the Civil Service, particularly in relation to Permanent Secretaries."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01841,2022-04-05-T-042,1841,Chan Chun Sing,"In building a dynamic, efficient and resilient Public Service, diversity is an important enabler."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01842,2022-04-05-T-042,1842,Chan Chun Sing,"Diversity has many dimensions, and is not limited to gender, ethnicity and background. It must also include the diversity of experiences of different job functions within and beyond the public sector. In forming strong leadership teams, we consider the performance, potential and competencies of the individual team members and how they complement one another."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01843,2022-04-05-T-042,1843,Chan Chun Sing,"In the Public Service, leadership roles are not confined to the Permanent Secretaries. Working with the political leadership, the Public Service senior leadership comprises Permanent Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Chief Executives, the heads of Professional Services, in domains, such as education, healthcare, urban planning, communications, science and technology, and the younger officers on the Public Service Leadership Programme. At the wider level, we also have the Chairmen and Board members of our Statutory Boards, as well as the members of our councils and advisory committees. Diversity is achieved at the system-level, rather than in specific segments of the leadership structure."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01844,2022-04-05-T-042,1844,Chan Chun Sing,"While desirable, it is not always possible to have every leadership segment to be a microcosm of our society. When a particular leadership segment is not representative of our wider society’s diversity, we establish structures and processes to ensure that the necessary breadth and depth of perspectives and interests are taken into consideration."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01845,2022-04-05-T-042,1845,Chan Chun Sing,"To achieve the desired diversity of perspectives, experiences and capabilities in our leadership teams, we adopt a multi-pronged approach."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01846,2022-04-05-T-042,1846,Chan Chun Sing,"Firstly, the Public Service is making efforts to recruit a more diverse range of candidates, including promising mid-career leaders outside the public sector who have the heart to serve. We also work with self-help community groups, such as MENDAKI and SINDA, on outreach programmes to share more about Public Service career opportunities. Through these efforts, we hope to bring in capable individuals from the minority groups to serve in various parts of the Public Service, including in leadership roles. At the scholarship stage, the Public Service Commission is mindful to seek out and award scholarships to candidates from diverse backgrounds."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01847,2022-04-05-T-042,1847,Chan Chun Sing,"For in-service officers, we have been expanding the opportunities to give them a more rounded experience. For the younger officers on the Public Service Leadership Programme, most are rotated to different roles in different sectors in their initial years, so that they have exposure to policy, operations, stakeholder engagement and international relations. As they progress in their careers, officers on the leadership programmes from across the Ministries and Statutory Boards also come together for milestone training programmes."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01848,2022-04-05-T-042,1848,Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond public sector postings, the Service has also been expanding the opportunities for attachments in the private and people sectors, to help our leaders appreciate ground realities, understand stakeholder perspectives and build their networks beyond the public sector."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01849,2022-04-05-T-042,1849,Chan Chun Sing,"We have a system of Statutory Boards, advisory councils and committees, where we harness the expertise and energies of many individuals in the private and people sectors to contribute on a wide range of issues, from governance to specialist skills to policy reviews. It is also a standard procedure for Ministries and Statutory Boards to consult widely, actively and systematically when enacting legislation or implementing a complex policy."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01850,2022-04-05-T-042,1850,Chan Chun Sing,"It is not always possible to achieve the same representations in all segments of our leadership system that mirror our society in all aspects. Neither is that necessarily our end goal. Instead, diversity of representation is but one of the many input indicators. Our desired and more important outcome indicator is the robust decision-making and effective and efficient execution of policies, programmes and public services, enriched by diverse perspectives and capabilities, and supported by our system of processes, structures, recruitment and deployments."
2022-04-05-T-042-S-01851,2022-04-05-T-042,1851,Chan Chun Sing,The Public Service will continue to build the best possible leadership team in the service of Singapore and Singaporeans.
2022-04-05-T-043-S-01852,2022-04-05-T-043,1852,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government will consider increasing the average size of HDB flats across flat types in view of changing societal trends and work norms.
2022-04-05-T-043-S-01853,2022-04-05-T-043,1853,Desmond Lee,"HDB flats are designed to provide a living environment that is functional and comfortable. For instance, bedrooms are built with large windows to optimise natural lighting and ventilation, while kitchens are designed to be open to increase the sense of spaciousness. HDB flat sizes have not changed since 1997, but average household sizes have decreased."
2022-04-05-T-043-S-01854,2022-04-05-T-043,1854,Desmond Lee,"HDB flats are also designed to give residents flexibility to reconfigure spaces in their homes to meet their needs, including working from home. For example, columns in new flats are pushed to the edges wherever possible, to better accommodate changes in layout. Many homeowners have personalised their homes through renovation and creative furnishing."
2022-04-05-T-043-S-01855,2022-04-05-T-043,1855,Desmond Lee,"Given Singapore’s land constraints, HDB has to strike a balance between the size of HDB flats and the supply of flats. We will continue to gather views and ideas to improve the design of public housing to better meet residents’ needs."
2022-04-05-T-044-S-01856,2022-04-05-T-044,1856,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can provide an update of its review of the framework guiding when and how environmental impact assessments should be done ahead of development works.
2022-04-05-T-044-S-01857,2022-04-05-T-044,1857,Desmond Lee,"We adopt a systematic framework to determine and mitigate the potential impact of new developments on the environment. Environmental studies, like Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), may be imposed as part of the planning process, to inform our understanding of the development’s potential impact and the adequacy of the proposed mitigation measures."
2022-04-05-T-044-S-01858,2022-04-05-T-044,1858,Desmond Lee,"As Singapore’s physical and operating environments change over the years, we have continually reviewed the EIA framework to ensure that it remains relevant and robust. In 2020, in consultation with the nature community, we rolled out a series of enhancements to increase the rigour of environmental studies conducted, strengthen enforcement of environmental measures imposed, and improve transparency of environmental study findings."
2022-04-05-T-044-S-01859,2022-04-05-T-044,1859,Desmond Lee,"Agencies are studying ways to further strengthen the framework, such as exploring the use of technology to improve project management and monitoring, and reviewing the centralisation of EIA consultants. NParks is also carrying out an islandwide Ecological Profiling Exercise (EPE), in partnership with members of the nature community, to build a more comprehensive picture of Singapore’s ecosystem and ecological connectivity. The first iteration of the EPE, which studied the ecological profile of green spaces and modelled terrestrial, coastal and marine connectivity across Singapore in consultation with a Scientific Advisory Panel, was completed recently and the findings will be shared later this year."
2022-04-05-T-044-S-01860,2022-04-05-T-044,1860,Desmond Lee,We recognise that our planning strategies must adapt and be nimble to respond to the evolving needs and aspirations of Singaporeans. We will continue to review the EIA framework to strike an effective balance that can support a diversity of values and aspirations across the generations and will provide updates on further enhancements when ready.
2022-04-05-T-045-S-01861,2022-04-05-T-045,1861,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour among fuel retailers to raise prices in the past two months; (b) what actions will the Government take against fuel retailers found to have engaged in anti-competitive behaviour; and (c) whether the Government has considered tapping on its petroleum reserves to ease the fuel supply crunch triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and moderate pump prices.
2022-04-05-T-045-S-01862,2022-04-05-T-045,1862,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Committee Against Profiteering will address concerns that businesses could use reasons, other than the rise in GST, as a pretext to make unjustified price increases on essential products and services; (b) whether the Committee will publish a list of essential products and services that fall under its ambit; and (c) what actions are the Committee or the Government empowered to take against businesses engaged in profiteering."
2022-04-05-T-045-S-01863,2022-04-05-T-045,1863,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether Singapore has petroleum reserves; (b) if so, how long will our petroleum reserves last in the event of a supply cut; (c) what are the considerations for tapping on these petroleum reserves; and (d) whether the Government will consider tapping on its petroleum reserves in the event of an extended fuel supply crunch precipitated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
2022-04-05-T-045-S-01864,2022-04-05-T-045,1864,Gan Kim Yong,"These questions have been addressed during the Joint Ministerial Statement delivered by Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Tan See Leng, on Inflation and Business Costs, on 4 April 2022. ["
2022-04-05-T-046-S-01865,2022-04-05-T-046,1865,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Prime Minister (a) for each year in the past five years, how many suspicious financial transaction reports related to wildlife crime have been filed; (b) how does the Government determine whether there is underreporting of suspicious transactions relating to wildlife crime; and (c) what is the Government doing to ensure that financial institutions keep a lookout and file such reports."
2022-04-05-T-046-S-01866,2022-04-05-T-046,1866,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Financial institutions (FIs) and other relevant business entities, such as traders or agents, are required by law to report suspicious transactions related to illegal wildlife trafficking (IWT). The Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) does not publicly release detailed statistics relating to suspicious transaction reports (STRs)."
2022-04-05-T-046-S-01867,2022-04-05-T-046,1867,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Enforcement action can be taken against FIs for non-compliance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also assesses FIs' ability to detect and report suspicious transactions in a timely manner through ongoing supervision of their anti-money laundering controls. MAS has drawn FIs' attention to relevant reports published by the Financial Action Task Force on the modus operandi used to launder proceeds from IWT. In addition, STRO proactively shares red flag indicators of IWT with banks, traders and their agents. The Association of Banks in Singapore also holds seminars and workshops to share best practices on managing the money laundering risks from IWT."
2022-04-05-T-046-S-01868,2022-04-05-T-046,1868,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Mr Louis Ng has highlighted an area of growing concern in the international community. As criminals become more sophisticated in concealing their illegal activities, combating money laundering related to IWT will require constant vigilance and close collaboration between the Government and the private sector."
2022-04-05-T-047-S-01869,2022-04-05-T-047,1869,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many youths have been caught for involvement in scams in the past year; (b) whether there is a rising trend of youths involved in scams; and (c) what is being done to educate and prevent youths from being lured into joining scam syndicates.
2022-04-05-T-047-S-01870,2022-04-05-T-047,1870,K Shanmugam,"The number of youths below the age of 30 who were arrested for scam-related offences jumped from 237 in 2019, to 509 in 2020, before decreasing slightly to 493 in 2021. Youths form about half of all scam-related offenders arrested in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-047-S-01871,2022-04-05-T-047,1871,K Shanmugam,"The cases, generally, involved youths acting as money mules. They either handed over control of their bank account, or disclosed their Singpass login details to scammers, or carried out scam-related bank transfers themselves in exchange for a commission. The youths were lured by the quick and easy money that could be made through scams and scam activities."
2022-04-05-T-047-S-01872,2022-04-05-T-047,1872,K Shanmugam,The Police have been working with schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to raise awareness amongst youths on the consequences of crime. These efforts include talks and crime prevention exhibitions.
2022-04-05-T-047-S-01873,2022-04-05-T-047,1873,K Shanmugam,"The Police have also been raising awareness specifically of the consequences of being involved in scam activities, such as acting as money mules. This is done through advisories and educational campaigns. For example, last year, the Police collaborated with the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to run a nationwide money mule public education campaign. The topic of money mule was also exclusively featured in an episode of “Hello Police?”, which is a web-series published on social media platforms, to raise awareness on the legal consequences of acting as a money mule and the immediate steps to take if one suspects that he or she has been used as a money mule."
2022-04-05-T-047-S-01874,2022-04-05-T-047,1874,K Shanmugam,The Police will continue to work with our stakeholders to enhance outreach to youths on the consequences of being involved in scam and other criminal activities.
2022-04-05-T-048-S-01875,2022-04-05-T-048,1875,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the reason for making it illegal for Singaporeans to participate in wars of other countries.
2022-04-05-T-048-S-01876,2022-04-05-T-048,1876,K Shanmugam,"Under section 125 of the Penal Code 1871, it is an offence for a Singaporean to wage, attempt to wage, or abet the waging of, war against the government of any power in alliance or at peace with the Singapore Government."
2022-04-05-T-048-S-01877,2022-04-05-T-048,1877,K Shanmugam,"Singaporeans' participation in such wars can affect Singapore's national interests in different ways, depending on the nature of the conflict. One impact is that such involvement could be misconstrued as Singapore's participation, or taking sides, in the war."
2022-04-05-T-048-S-01878,2022-04-05-T-048,1878,K Shanmugam,"We also do not want Singapore Citizens to engage in violence, except in defence of Singapore. Those who participate in wars of other countries may also pose a threat to national security upon their return to Singapore, depending on the nature of the conflict."
2022-04-05-T-048-S-01879,2022-04-05-T-048,1879,K Shanmugam,"Singaporeans who wish to help Ukrainians can do so in several ways. For instance, they may donate to legitimate organisations, such as the Singapore Red Cross, that have been raising funds for humanitarian aid to support affected communities in Ukraine."
2022-04-05-T-049-S-01880,2022-04-05-T-049,1880,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what proportion of all scam victims in Singapore last year are holders of (i) Long-Term Visit Pass (ii) Work Permit and (iii) S Pass; and (b) what efforts are being made to educate low-income foreign workers on the avenues of recourse available to them if they fall victim to such scams.
2022-04-05-T-049-S-01881,2022-04-05-T-049,1881,K Shanmugam,"In 2021, there were 23,931 cases of scam reported. Of the scam victims, 0.2% were Long-Term Visit Pass holders, 15.5% were Work Permit holders, and 1.6% were S Pass holders."
2022-04-05-T-049-S-01882,2022-04-05-T-049,1882,K Shanmugam,"The Police work closely with non-governmental organisations, dormitory operators and embassies to share anti-scam advisories with the foreign workers. These include advice on the steps they can take if they have fallen victim to scams. Advisories are also translated into the foreign workers' native language, where appropriate."
2022-04-05-T-049-S-01883,2022-04-05-T-049,1883,K Shanmugam,"The Police's outreach efforts focus on raising awareness of the tell-tale signs of scams and providing prevention tips. MOM also provides anti-scam advisories and resources to foreign workers. For example, by disseminating anti-scam advice in their native language to foreign workers who attend the Settling-in-Programme upon arrival in Singapore."
2022-04-05-T-050-S-01884,2022-04-05-T-050,1884,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to emergency calls made to SPF and SCDF respectively over the last three years, what is the annual number of calls that are from (i) landline phone numbers (ii) landline residential phone numbers and (iii) mobile phone numbers."
2022-04-05-T-050-S-01885,2022-04-05-T-050,1885,K Shanmugam,"The SPF and SCDF do not track the calls by whether they come from landline, landline residential or mobile phone."
2022-04-05-T-051-S-01886,2022-04-05-T-051,1886,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what plans does Singapore have to diversify our energy consumption beyond petroleum and other liquids so as to better insulate us against disruptions in the global supply of hydrocarbon resources.
2022-04-05-T-051-S-01887,2022-04-05-T-051,1887,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether an update on the SolarNova programme can be provided; and (b) how has the installation of the solar photovoltaic (PV) systems contributed to Singapore’s production of electricity and its impact on electricity costs.
2022-04-05-T-051-S-01888,2022-04-05-T-051,1888,Gan Kim Yong,"The questions have been addressed during the Joint Ministerial Statement delivered by Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Tan See Leng, on Inflation and Business Costs, on 4 April 2022. ["
2022-04-05-T-052-S-01889,2022-04-05-T-052,1889,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry given the recent streamlining of COVID-19 measures (a) what is the status of plans to allow the reopening of family KTVs; and (b) what are the expected safe management measures that will be applied.
2022-04-05-T-052-S-01890,2022-04-05-T-052,1890,Gan Kim Yong,"MTI and MHA have announced their intention to reopen the nightlife sector, including karaoke establishments, on 19 April 2022. The Safe Management Measures (SMMs) will include the five core parameters on group sizes; mask-wearing; workplace requirements; safe distancing; and capacity limits. For nightlife establishments where customers will be dancing, supervised Antigen Rapid Test (ART) will be required for customers before entering the premises."
2022-04-05-T-053-S-01891,2022-04-05-T-053,1891,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry can provide a summary of the financial risks faced by Singaporean companies in Russia today, such as those due to sanctions, decline in the Russian rouble and difficulty in making cross-border payments."
2022-04-05-T-053-S-01892,2022-04-05-T-053,1892,Gan Kim Yong,"Due to sanctions, restrictions and uncertainties in the Russian economy, Singapore companies operating in Russia may face foreign exchange losses and challenges in cross-border transactions, which could impact their cash flows and financial performance."
2022-04-05-T-053-S-01893,2022-04-05-T-053,1893,Gan Kim Yong,The sanctions and restrictions imposed on Russia by Singapore are specific and targeted. They are aimed at constraining Russia’s capacity to conduct war against Ukraine. They prohibit transactions with four Russian banks and the financing of military goods and some dual-use goods for offensive cyber operations that are also subject to export controls in Singapore.
2022-04-05-T-053-S-01894,2022-04-05-T-053,1894,Gan Kim Yong,Singapore's financial institutions and companies also have to manage the legal and operational risks from infringing sanctions imposed by several other jurisdictions on Russia where the sanctions have extraterritorial impact.
2022-04-05-T-054-S-01895,2022-04-05-T-054,1895,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether nuclear fission small modular reactors and nuclear fusion reactors which are considered by EMA as potential future sources of green energy will be resilient in the event of war and unlikely to cause a nuclear accident even if subject to military attack.
2022-04-05-T-054-S-01896,2022-04-05-T-054,1896,Gan Kim Yong,I thank the Member for his question. It has been addressed by the reply to Questions 24 to 26 for oral answers during the 4 April 2022 Parliament sitting. [
2022-04-05-T-055-S-01897,2022-04-05-T-055,1897,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider mandating companies operating heavy vehicles in estates with narrow lanes and few access roads, such as Serangoon Gardens, to deploy traffic wardens or banksmen and to follow strict protocols in traversing the roads so as to prevent the occurrence of massive jams within the estate."
2022-04-05-T-055-S-01898,2022-04-05-T-055,1898,S Iswaran,"Heavy vehicles, typically, ply roads that are specifically planned to serve industrial areas to keep industrial traffic away from residential estates."
2022-04-05-T-055-S-01899,2022-04-05-T-055,1899,S Iswaran,"Where we cannot avoid heavy vehicles accessing residential roads, for instance, to access construction sites within residential estates, LTA requires contractors to deploy traffic marshals for road works under appropriate conditions. This includes situations where road works affect traffic junctions or result in a shared right of way, for example, when a bi-directional road is made to share a single lane; this is, usually, where roads are narrow with one lane in each direction. To further mitigate congestion caused by heavy vehicles for road works, lane closures are only allowed during off-peak hours."
2022-04-05-T-056-S-01900,2022-04-05-T-056,1900,Sylvia Lim,"asked  the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the continuing recalibration and relaxation of the COVID-19 control measures, whether the Government will enable families holding funeral wakes to serve catered food and drinks to visitors."
2022-04-05-T-056-S-01901,2022-04-05-T-056,1901,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Funeral events are not subjected to Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures to allow families and loved ones to pay their last respects, regardless of their vaccination status. To mitigate the risks of transmission of COVID-19 to unvaccinated attendees, the serving and consumption of food and beverages remain prohibited at funeral events. We will continue to monitor the situation and review this position moving forward."
2022-04-05-T-057-S-01902,2022-04-05-T-057,1902,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for the past five years, how many complaints have been made against social workers annually; (b) what are the most common complaints made; and (c) of these, how many complaints are made against unaccredited social workers."
2022-04-05-T-057-S-01903,2022-04-05-T-057,1903,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MSF appoints the Social Work Accreditation and Advisory Board (SWAAB) to uphold standards of professional conduct and code of ethics of the social work profession. A complaint may be lodged to SWAAB against an accredited social worker for breaching the Code of Professional Ethics.
2022-04-05-T-057-S-01904,2022-04-05-T-057,1904,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SWAAB received a total of 22 complaints from 2017 to 2021, five of which were against unaccredited Social Workers. Of the 22 complaints, the most common ones were on practice concerns and service quality, and these were referred to the Social Worker’s employer to address the issues raised by the complainant."
2022-04-05-T-057-S-01905,2022-04-05-T-057,1905,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MSF will continue to uphold the standards of professional conduct and code of ethics of the social work profession in the sector through SWAAB.
2022-04-05-T-058-S-01906,2022-04-05-T-058,1906,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in view of the current rising costs which may lead to more Singaporeans applying for financial assistance, whether the Government is looking to streamline the means-testing procedures for public assistance applications and renewals, including reducing the number of physical documents that need to be submitted, and seamlessly pulling the necessary financial information from agencies upon obtaining the necessary permissions from the applicants."
2022-04-05-T-058-S-01907,2022-04-05-T-058,1907,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past few years, MSF has been working with Government agencies to progressively reduce the administrative burden for Singaporeans in need applying for ComCare. We leverage backend data-sharing arrangements, simplified referrals and streamlined application processes to deliver more comprehensive, convenient and coordinated (3C) support. For example, if ComCare applicants provide their consent, the Social Service Offices (SSOs) will be able to pull relevant data backend from agencies, such as Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB), HDB and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). This minimises the submission of physical documents and reduces the need for repeated means-testing."
2022-04-05-T-058-S-01908,2022-04-05-T-058,1908,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since 2018, ComCare applicants have been able to access 101 adjacent financial assistance schemes more easily, upon approval of their ComCare assistance. For example, eligible ComCare clients automatically qualify for MediFund assistance and the Higher Education Community Bursary for full-time ITE and Polytechnic students. There is no need to submit additional application forms and supporting documents, nor undergo repeated means-testing. For the remaining schemes, clients can submit their ComCare assistance letter in lieu of multiple supporting documents."
2022-04-05-T-058-S-01909,2022-04-05-T-058,1909,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As announced at MSF's Committee of Supply Debate 2022, we will be offering scheme bundles to further strengthen support for ComCare families, starting with a bundle for school-going children that covers Ministry of Education Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) and MSF Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA). By end June 2022, eligible ComCare families with children attending Government or Government-aided schools and MSF-registered Student Care Centres (SCCs) or Special Student Care Centres (SSCCs) will automatically qualify for MOE FAS and MSF SCFA. Families need not submit separate applications, and maximum SCFA subsidies will be provided for eligible children for a duration of 12 months."
2022-04-05-T-058-S-01910,2022-04-05-T-058,1910,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, Singaporeans in need will be able to apply for and renew their ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance online via the enhanced SupportGoWhere (SGW) portal by end-June 2022. The portal will tap on Myinfo to auto-populate relevant personal information, for greater convenience. Applicants can also submit supporting documents directly through the portal, instead of physical documents at the SSOs."
2022-04-05-T-058-S-01911,2022-04-05-T-058,1911,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will progressively expand the number of ComCare scheme bundles, and onboard more financial support schemes onto the SGW portal, to provide greater 3C support for those in need."
2022-04-05-T-059-S-01912,2022-04-05-T-059,1912,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Health whether there are plans for the development of practical community mental health programmes, based on studies and research from previous national outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as SARS, to help individuals, particularly children, in coping with the psychological and psychosocial responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic."
2022-04-05-T-059-S-01913,2022-04-05-T-059,1913,Ong Ye Kung,A study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on Singapore population’s psychological responses and mental well-being found that about 13% of the respondents reported symptoms of depression or anxiety in the period from May 2020 to June 2021. Programmes were available to help provide Singaporeans with psychological support during this period and continue to be available.
2022-04-05-T-059-S-01914,2022-04-05-T-059,1914,Ong Ye Kung,"The National CARE Hotline (NCH) provides emotional and psychological first aid to those who are affected. HPB provides a national mental health resources portal on HealthHub to provide Singaporeans with credible, reliable and convenient access to mental health information."
2022-04-05-T-059-S-01915,2022-04-05-T-059,1915,Ong Ye Kung,"Specific programmes to help children and their families cope with the COVID-19 pandemic are also available. For example, MSF offers evidence-based parenting programmes, such as the Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) and Signposts, to equip parents with skills and strategies to build strong, healthy relationships with their child (aged up to 16), and confidently manage their child’s behaviour."
2022-04-05-T-059-S-01916,2022-04-05-T-059,1916,Ong Ye Kung,Measures to support students’ mental health are provided in the schools by MOE. These include Mental Health Education lessons taught within the refreshed Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. Teachers also conduct regular check-ins to closely monitor and support students’ mental well-being.
2022-04-05-T-059-S-01917,2022-04-05-T-059,1917,Ong Ye Kung,"The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has also been working with community partners to set up community mental health teams to reach out and offer a range of mental health support services for individuals, including youths, at risk of or suspected to have mental health conditions."
2022-04-05-T-060-S-01918,2022-04-05-T-060,1918,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health with the relaxation of the five-visitors-per-day rule, whether there are any plans to allow for special dispensation for immediate family members to visit COVID-19 patients for their final farewell."
2022-04-05-T-060-S-01919,2022-04-05-T-060,1919,Ong Ye Kung,"COVID-19 infected patients who are critically ill are allowed visits by family members, but with limits, to minimise the risk of infections spreading in hospitals. As the pandemic situation continues to improve, the visiting rules will be reviewed."
2022-04-05-T-061-S-01920,2022-04-05-T-061,1920,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health in the last three months (a) how many days did each restructured hospital have to open or activate additional spill-over wards beyond the standard isolation wards to contain patients with COVID-19; and (b) how many patients in total were admitted to these spill-over or contingency wards.
2022-04-05-T-061-S-01921,2022-04-05-T-061,1921,Ong Ye Kung,"In normal, pre-COVID-19 times, we maintain about 460 isolation beds across our public hospitals. In the last three months, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public hospitals operated between about 960 and 1,680 isolation beds to care for COVID-19 patients. Public hospitals also had to activate surge capacity beyond normal ward capacity. As the Member would appreciate, during a pandemic crisis where emergency responses are the order of the day, such plans have to be very regularly activated."
2022-04-05-T-062-S-01922,2022-04-05-T-062,1922,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Health regarding the capacity of restructured hospitals in the last three months (a) for how many days did the emergency departments of each restructured hospital have to close or divert patients away due to its capacity being reached; (b) which hospitals or departments have been particularly badly hit; and (c) how many days have the respective emergency departments of these hospitals seen waiting times of over (i) two hours (ii) four hours and (iii) six hours, before patients could be triaged."
2022-04-05-T-062-S-01923,2022-04-05-T-062,1923,Ong Ye Kung,"In the last three months, Singapore went through a severe pandemic crisis. It is a global crisis that affects all countries and regions. Fortunately, our population is highly vaccinated. Hence, COVID-19 infections have not translated into many cases with severe illness and our ICU wards did not come under pressure."
2022-04-05-T-062-S-01924,2022-04-05-T-062,1924,Ong Ye Kung,"It has been the hospital Emergency Departments (ED) that are most busy. During that time, MOH had approved the diversion of SCDF ambulances on seven different occasions from three hospitals (CGH, KTPH and SKH). We are able to do so because the conditions of the patients were non-critical. This helped hospitals manage their capacity at the EDs, so that patients with critical conditions can be attended to quickly. The duration of diversions varied, ranging from two hours to six hours."
2022-04-05-T-062-S-01925,2022-04-05-T-062,1925,Ong Ye Kung,"All patients presenting at EDs are triaged at registration, usually within half an hour, to determine the level of priority for emergency treatment. Their waiting times for clinical consultation varies, depending on the clinical condition of the patient. Critically ill patients are seen almost immediately."
2022-04-05-T-063-S-01926,2022-04-05-T-063,1926,Yip Hon Weng,"asked  the Minister for Health with regard to disability assessment under ElderShield (a) which conditions are exempted from repeated assessments; (b) whether the Ministry will consider removing the requirement for reassessments for claimants who have been medically certified with permanent conditions, such as brain damage or end-stage Parkinson’s disease; and (c) whether the Ministry will extend the grace period for such reassessments, in view of the healthcare manpower crunch caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."
2022-04-05-T-063-S-01927,2022-04-05-T-063,1927,Ong Ye Kung,"This question has been addressed by Question No. 34, as contained in the Circular for Written Answer on 4 April 2022. ["
2022-04-05-T-064-S-01928,2022-04-05-T-064,1928,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to HDB commercial lessees (a) what enforcement levers are available for HDB to take against sub-tenants for contravention of tenancy conditions; (b) whether HDB has a scale of penalties to be imposed against lessees, before ultimately terminating a lease agreement; and (c) how does HDB exercise its discretion in calibrating the appropriate penalty to impose in each case of breach of tenancy conditions by a lessee or sub-tenant."
2022-04-05-T-064-S-01929,2022-04-05-T-064,1929,Desmond Lee,"For HDB rental premises, both the tenants and sub-tenants, if any, must comply with HDB's tenancy terms for the premises. Tenants are required to seek prior approval from HDB if they wish to sublet part of their premises. In the event of any breach of tenancy terms by the tenant or their sub-tenants, HDB may take appropriate enforcement action as provided for under the Tenancy Agreement with the tenant, such as serving Notice to Quit to recover the premises. For tenants who sublet their premises illegally, HDB can impose graduated financial penalties and debar the tenant from future tenders for a fixed period."
2022-04-05-T-064-S-01930,2022-04-05-T-064,1930,Desmond Lee,"Where there are breaches of tenancy conditions, HDB will consider the facts of each case to determine the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. Considerations include whether safety is compromised, the tenant's willingness to rectify the infringement, as well as the severity of the contraventions as well as any complaints against the tenant/sub-tenant, for example, whether multiple or isolated complaints were received."
2022-04-05-T-064-S-01931,2022-04-05-T-064,1931,Desmond Lee,"If the tenant or sub-tenant does not take the necessary rectification actions, HDB may terminate the tenancy agreement and pursue legal action, if necessary."
2022-04-05-T-064-S-01932,2022-04-05-T-064,1932,Desmond Lee,"For sold shops, the owners and operators are required to comply with licensing requirements by the various authorities, such as SPF, SCDF and SFA for fire safety and application of trade-specific licences such as liquor licence and massage establishment licence."
2022-04-05-T-065-S-01933,2022-04-05-T-065,1933,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB takes into account the variety of businesses in the HDB estate when granting approvals for HDB commercial unit leases; and (b) whether more proactive measures can be taken to promote diversity of businesses within HDB commercial premises, such as introducing limits on the number of similar services within a certain distance or encouraging existing businesses to expand their offerings."
2022-04-05-T-065-S-01934,2022-04-05-T-065,1934,Desmond Lee,HDB imposes trade mix controls in smaller rental shop clusters within our HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) developments to ensure that the basic needs of our residents are met. These controls are also imposed for shops in standalone HDB shopping complexes to ensure that there is sufficient variety of shops to serve residents.
2022-04-05-T-065-S-01935,2022-04-05-T-065,1935,Desmond Lee,"For traditional neighbourhood centres (NCs), which typically house a larger number of shops, HDB allows for greater market flexibility in the trade mix. The larger number of shops provides sufficient opportunity for market forces to determine a good trade mix, while still ensuring that residents’ essential needs are met and local heritage is preserved."
2022-04-05-T-065-S-01936,2022-04-05-T-065,1936,Desmond Lee,"However, HDB does set quotas on trades which may cause potential disamenities, for example, eating establishments with noise and exhaust air pollution, massage parlours. Such quotas are also imposed for sold shops for cases where the sold shop owners seek HDB’s approval for a change of use to these trades."
2022-04-05-T-065-S-01937,2022-04-05-T-065,1937,Desmond Lee,"With the rise of online retailers and services complemented with enabling infrastructure like federated lockers, the commercial and retail sector will have to innovate to remain relevant. HDB is in the midst of conducting a Heartland Shops Study which seeks to study the social and economic value of heartland shops for various stakeholders, including residents, the community and business owners. We will consider strengthening policy levers if the study reveals that HDB should play a more proactive role in curating trade mix in our heartland commercial spaces."
2022-04-05-T-066-S-01938,2022-04-05-T-066,1938,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, what is the number of (i) proposals received (ii) proposals rejected and (iii) approvals given under the CBD Incentive Scheme and Strategic Development Incentive Scheme respectively; and (b) what are their respective average percentage increases in development intensity."
2022-04-05-T-066-S-01939,2022-04-05-T-066,1939,Desmond Lee,"The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)'s Central Business District Incentive Scheme (CBDI) is intended to encourage the conversion of existing older office buildings in the CBD into mixed-use developments, so as to inject a larger live-in population and greater amenity mix to rejuvenate the CBD. URA's Strategic Development Incentive Scheme (SDI) encourages the redevelopment of older buildings and precincts in strategic areas across Singapore to positively transform the surrounding urban environment."
2022-04-05-T-066-S-01940,2022-04-05-T-066,1940,Desmond Lee,"To date, URA has received 12 outline applications under CBDI, of which eight have been given in-principle approval. URA has received and given in-principle approval for four outline applications under SDI."
2022-04-05-T-066-S-01941,2022-04-05-T-066,1941,Desmond Lee,"Developments approved under CBDI are allowed a maximum increase of 25% or 30% in their development intensity, based on their Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) or Approved GPR, whichever is higher. For SDI, the allowable increase is dependent on the specifics of each site, such as the urban and architectural design concepts, infrastructure capacity, environmental contributions to the surrounding areas."
2022-04-05-T-066-S-01942,2022-04-05-T-066,1942,Desmond Lee,"We will continue to monitor the market trends and needs, engage developers and industry professionals, to work towards rejuvenating our CBD and other strategic areas."
2022-04-05-T-067-S-01943,2022-04-05-T-067,1943,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for ceasing to build new HDB executive apartments and executive maisonettes; and (b) whether the Government will consider reintroducing such flat types.
2022-04-05-T-067-S-01944,2022-04-05-T-067,1944,Desmond Lee,"HDB stopped building Executive Apartments and Executive Maisonettes, collectively termed as Executive flats, in August 1995, after the introduction of the Executive Condominium (EC) Housing Scheme. EC units provide a housing option for Singaporeans, in addition to HDB flats."
2022-04-05-T-067-S-01945,2022-04-05-T-067,1945,Desmond Lee,"New EC units are sold with initial eligibility and ownership restrictions to keep prices affordable. Eligible first-timer citizen families can enjoy the CPF Housing Grant when buying EC units from property developers. EC units become private properties after 10 years, thus meeting the private housing aspirations of Singaporeans."
2022-04-05-T-067-S-01946,2022-04-05-T-067,1946,Desmond Lee,There are no plans to reintroduce new Executive flats. Home seekers can consider the wide range of housing types currently available for new builds and the resale market.
2022-04-05-T-068-S-01947,2022-04-05-T-068,1947,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development what measures have been put in place to prevent delays in the construction of HDB flats as a result of the increase in cost of building materials arising from supply chain disruption and the ongoing geopolitical crisis.
2022-04-05-T-068-S-01948,2022-04-05-T-068,1948,Desmond Lee,"Arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, tightened border controls for foreign workers and supply chain disruptions, we earlier updated that ongoing projects were delayed by about six to 12 months beyond their original Estimated Completion Dates (ECDs). HDB is in the process of informing flat buyers of the extent of delays that have materialised. Nevertheless, HDB has worked closely with contractors to mitigate the extent of the delays. For ongoing projects, we expect that most flat buyers will be able to move into their new homes within four to five years after booking their flats, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The current median waiting times of projects launched in 2020 and 2021, after factoring in delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, are about 4.5 years and 3.8 years respectively."
2022-04-05-T-068-S-01949,2022-04-05-T-068,1949,Desmond Lee,"We have not observed any significant further disruptions to the supply of construction materials arising from the Ukraine-Russia conflict thus far, and the progress of BTO projects has not been affected. Nonetheless, over the last quarter, the prices of steel rebars and Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC) have increased by about 17% and 7% respectively."
2022-04-05-T-068-S-01950,2022-04-05-T-068,1950,Desmond Lee,"HDB has worked with its contractors to enhance their existing stockpiles of building materials by procuring them in advance to mitigate potential disruptions. HDB is also closely monitoring the prices of the construction materials and has worked hard to strengthen the resilience of our public housing programme. HDB has been providing extensive assistance to help contractors complete ongoing BTO projects in a timely manner, without affecting safety and quality. For instance, to help with the higher cost of materials, HDB has extended the period of protection against steel price fluctuations and supplied contractors with more concreting materials at protected prices. To tackle manpower shortages, HDB has worked with firms to safely recruit workers from various countries and co-shared the cost of bringing in the migrant workers."
2022-04-05-T-068-S-01951,2022-04-05-T-068,1951,Desmond Lee,"With the pandemic situation stabilising, the situation in the construction industry has started to show some signs of improvement. Nonetheless, with new uncertainties, such as the ongoing geopolitical crisis and potential supply chain disruptions, HDB is closely monitoring the prices of key construction materials and remains ready to extend further assistance as necessary. With the various assistance measures put in place, HDB is working hard on the ground to minimise delays to our existing BTO projects while leaning forward to support homebuyers who may be affected by the delays. HDB remains committed to its mission to deliver public housing to Singaporeans and will spare no effort to recover as much of the delays as possible and to keep our BTO programme on track."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01952,2022-04-05-T-069,1952,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth how can safeguards be put in place to ensure that core aspects of Singapore’s culture are not lost in the current COVID-19 pandemic so that the youth continue to enjoy an environment to develop their cultural identity."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01953,2022-04-05-T-069,1953,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our arts and culture give us our unique identity, instil pride in our people, and foster a stronger, more cohesive society. Over the past two years, MCCY, National Arts Council (NAC) and National Heritage Board (NHB) have rolled out measures to support livelihoods, build capabilities and position our arts and culture sector for a strong recovery. These initiatives have safeguarded our arts and culture and allowed Singaporeans from all walks of life, including youths, to continue participating in arts and culture activities during the pandemic."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01954,2022-04-05-T-069,1954,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The $75 million Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) safeguarded jobs and talent in the sector. The ACRP and broad-based support schemes supported over 900 arts and culture organisations, through operating grants to defray costs and overheads, grants for capability development and organisation transformation. In addition, the ACRP supported over 1,500 digitalisation projects, which provided digital access to arts and culture offerings during the pandemic. Our arts and culture practitioners and organisations have made use of the ACRP to resume activities safely, while transforming themselves to meet future challenges."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01955,2022-04-05-T-069,1955,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Students continued to have access to arts and culture education during the pandemic, through school programmes and external offerings."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01956,2022-04-05-T-069,1956,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"NAC supported Arts Education Programme (AEP) providers, comprising local arts groups and freelancers, to digitalise arts education programmes. NAC also supported AEP providers’ pivot to hybrid or virtual modes of teaching by raising capabilities in e-pedagogy, such as through the development of an E-Learning Primer and an Inspiring Digital Learning webinar, with the National Institute of Education."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01957,2022-04-05-T-069,1957,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation resumed in 2021 following the virtual arts festival SYFgoesOnline! introduced in 2020. These efforts complemented the regular Art and Music curricula and arts Co-Curricular Activities in school which continued to be carried out through a mixture of in-person, virtual and hybrid modes."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01958,2022-04-05-T-069,1958,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, even though in-person Museum-Based Learning (MBL) sessions were suspended during the circuit breaker period, NHB worked with MOE to co-develop online resources to facilitate both teacher-directed and self-directed learning. Physical MBL sessions to the National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum progressively resumed from October 2020. In 2021, NHB also piloted virtual MBL sessions to enable more students to participate."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01959,2022-04-05-T-069,1959,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our arts and culture sector has also engaged the youths actively during the pandemic, through digital and hybrid formats or smaller scale events. These include programmes, such as NHB’s Children’s Season, National Gallery Singapore’s Children’s Biennale, Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre’s youth festival RE MIX, and the Esplanade’s Feed Your Imagination series, which have all resumed in hybrid format. Since 2021, NAC, MCCY and the National Youth Council have also jointly organised ArtsXplore, an incubation programme that enables the youths to engage in arts exploration, experimentation and creation together."
2022-04-05-T-069-S-01960,2022-04-05-T-069,1960,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Youths have a stake in the future of Singapore’s arts and culture. As we chart our future directions and draw up plans for Our SG Art and Heritage Plans 2.0, NAC and NHB have embarked on conversations with our arts and heritage community, as well as youths, on the arts and heritage landscape in Singapore. We will encourage our youths to share their views and ideas with NAC and NHB during the public call later this year."
2022-04-05-T-070-S-01961,2022-04-05-T-070,1961,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry intends to make it a legal requirement that consent for work on rest day must be given in writing for low-wage workers below a given salary threshold; and (b) if not, why."
2022-04-05-T-070-S-01962,2022-04-05-T-070,1962,Tan See Leng,"As mentioned in MOM's response to Question No 3 for written answer on the Order Paper for 11 March 2022, it is advisable that if work on a rest day is routinely scheduled, such agreement should be captured in writing to avoid disputes. Employees are entitled to withdraw consent at any time."
2022-04-05-T-070-S-01963,2022-04-05-T-070,1963,Tan See Leng,"It would be impractical to require employers to always obtain written consent, as business needs can be fluid and work on a rest day may not always be routinely scheduled. In these cases, verbal consent from the employee would suffice."
2022-04-05-T-070-S-01964,2022-04-05-T-070,1964,Tan See Leng,"Any employee who is being compelled to work on his rest day, without consent, should approach MOM for further assistance."

2022-04-05-T-071-S-01966,2022-04-05-T-071,1966,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Workforce Vaccination Measures (a) whether the Ministry has data on the number of employees who are not vaccinated and are terminated due to the inability of redeployment; and (b) if so, what is the number."
2022-04-05-T-071-S-01967,2022-04-05-T-071,1967,Tan See Leng,"As of 27 March 2022, 98.4% of the total workforce have been vaccinated whilst the number of local and foreign employees who had not taken any vaccine dose has fallen considerably to 36,900. Data on the number of unvaccinated employees who have ceased employment since the Workforce Vaccination Measures came into effect in January 2022 will only be available in mid-2022."
2022-04-05-T-072-S-01968,2022-04-05-T-072,1968,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower from 2005 to 2020, what is the net increase of local Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) jobs that are not taken up by an applicant who has become a new citizen or obtained permanent resident status during this period."
2022-04-05-T-072-S-01969,2022-04-05-T-072,1969,Tan See Leng,"The number of local PMEs in Singapore is based on data collected via the Labour Force Survey. MOM started collecting data on respondents’ place of birth from 2010 onwards, hence, this data is not available for the period of 2005 to 2009."
2022-04-05-T-072-S-01970,2022-04-05-T-072,1970,Tan See Leng,"Based on the available data, the majority of local PME growth over the last 10 years, that is, from 2010 to 2020, went to Singaporeans who were born in Singapore. This is also the case for local PMET growth. This means that foreign-born individuals who obtained citizenship or permanent resident status at any point in time before end-2020 accounted for less than half of the increase in the number of local PMEs and local PMETs over the last 10 years."
