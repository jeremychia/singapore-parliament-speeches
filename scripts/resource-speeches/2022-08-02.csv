2022-08-02-T-001,Koh Lian Pin,Prof Koh Lian Pin,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether guidelines on managing heat stress at workplaces are regularly updated to incorporate the latest scientific evidence; and (b) whether these guidelines will consider any preliminary findings of the Third National Climate Change Study.,1,1,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00001
2022-08-02-T-001,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the changing climate and increasing frequency of extreme weather events, in particular extreme heat, what targeted measures are being taken to mitigate the impact of these events on heat vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or lower income groups, who are more at risk of adverse effects, due to physiological or social obstacles to cooling solutions.",1,2,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00002
2022-08-02-T-001,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether studies are being conducted or will be conducted to better understand the distribution of heat and energy inequality in our communities; and (b) what are the long-term plans to build heat resilient communities.,1,3,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00003
2022-08-02-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether Singapore's island-wide temperature and urban heat island projections require revision in light of the ongoing climate crisis and recent heat waves reported around the world; and (b) what projections exist for how future temperature trends will affect (i) indoor temperatures (ii) building ventilation requirements and (iii) usage of air-conditioning.,1,4,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00004
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I have your permission to address Question Nos 1 to 4, and written Question Nos 22 and 23 on today's Order Paper by a combined reply? And for any supplementary questions to Question Nos 1 to 4 to be taken after the reply to Question No 7 has been given, as the issues raised in Question Nos 1 to 7 are inter-related and will be addressed jointly by myself and the Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How.",1,5,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00005
2022-08-02-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Please do.,1,6,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00006
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I thank Members Prof Koh Lian Pin, Ms He Ting Ru, Dr Tan Wu Meng and Mr Christopher de Souza for their questions on how Singapore is preparing for rising temperatures. I will address them together with Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How in two parts. First, I will set out the broad context of how climate change and rising temperatures will affect Singapore and outline the Government's approach to strengthening Singapore's heat resilience. Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How will then elaborate on specific policies and measures to cool our neighbourhoods and community spaces.",1,7,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00007
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In recent weeks, many countries have been experiencing heatwaves, including China, India, Pakistan and many European countries. Record-breaking temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius have resulted in deaths, heat injuries and damaged infrastructure. These heat waves are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide as a result of climate change and portends the severe consequences we would face if we do not take significant steps today to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.",2,8,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00008
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore will not be spared from the impacts of global warming – 2012 to 2021 was our warmest decade on record. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore, CCRS for short, has projected that climate change would lead to average temperatures rising by 1.4 to 4.6 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Days with peak temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius may appear as early as 2045. This is compounded by the urban heat island effect, or ""UHI"" effect, where built-up areas are warmer due to heat trapped by buildings and heat generated by activities, such as transportation and industry.",3,9,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00009
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To prepare for rising temperatures, the Government has adopted a science-based and proactive heat mitigation and adaption strategy, which has three prongs. First, we are deepening our understanding of the science behind how rising temperatures affects Singapore and our residents. Second, we are reviewing efforts to strengthen the community's resilience to heat. Third, we are designing effective heat mitigation strategies and scaling them up. Let me elaborate on the three prongs.",4,10,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00010
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, understanding the science of how heat affects Singapore and our residents. The CCRS translates global climate projections to understand the localised effects and implications for Singapore. For example, while we do not experience the extreme temperatures arising from high pressure systems that form across large continental masses in the mid-latitude region, we are affected by climate drivers such as El Niño, that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. These projections are being reviewed and will be updated through the Third National Climate Change Study, or ""V3"", that will be released next year. This will enable our heat mitigation action plan and other climate adaptation planning to be informed by the latest IPCC findings and by local and regional warming trends.",5,11,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00011
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To understand how heat affects the Singapore population, we are driving research and development to study the factors contributing to urban heat, test different heat mitigation strategies and assess the effects of heat on public health. For example, under the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project, we are working with researchers to develop a digital model to simulate Singapore's urban climate and predict the effectiveness of various heat mitigation strategies. This enables us to understand how heat affects different parts of Singapore and identify cost-effective heat mitigation strategies.",6,12,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00012
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, we leverage science to design better policies and guidelines to strengthen community resilience to climate change, especially to account for the fact that some segments of our population, such as the elderly or outdoor workers, may be more vulnerable to rising temperatures. MOH and MSE are studying how heat stress could affect our population. MOH, MOM and the Workplace Safety and Health Council also work closely together to ensure that guidelines on managing heat stress at workplaces are regularly updated based on the latest scientific evidence, including the V3 study which I had earlier mentioned.",7,13,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00013
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, designing effective heat mitigation strategies, of which there are two broad categories. First, measures to promote cooling in our urban environment, such as through urban planning and building guidelines, infusing more greenery and scaling up the use of cool materials on buildings. Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How will elaborate on these. Second, measures to reduce the heat generated from human activities, such as from our homes, our roads and our industries. These include, for example, efforts under the Singapore Green Plan to electrify our vehicle population and to increase the energy efficiency of industrial, commercial and residential buildings.",8,14,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00014
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Individuals also play an important part. When we use less electricity, we not only reduce the heat emitted from our own electrical appliances, we also reduce the energy that needs to be generated by our power stations, thereby reducing both heat generation and carbon emissions at the system level. Hence, we have been enhancing community resilience to climate change by encouraging businesses and individuals to adopt greater energy efficiency, such as the introduction of the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme to help consumers choose more energy-efficient appliances.",9,15,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00015
2022-08-02-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Although Singapore has so far not faced heat crises on the same scale as other countries, it would not be possible to avoid the rise in temperatures due to global warming. We must continue to engage and co-create solutions with the community to enhance our resilience to climate change. We will also roll out policies and measures to cool our neighbourhoods and community spaces, which Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How will now elaborate on.",10,16,2022-08-02-T-001-S-00016
2022-08-02-T-002,Koh Lian Pin,Prof Koh Lian Pin,asked the Minister for National Development whether an update can be provided on the progress and impact of the initiative to plant more trees in our industrial estates to help cool these industrial estates and create a more conducive work environment.,1,17,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00017
2022-08-02-T-002,Koh Lian Pin,Prof Koh Lian Pin,"asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry has conducted studies to assess what species of trees and other vegetation may provide the most optimal shading and cooling benefits for mitigating rising temperatures and the urban heat island effect, as part of the OneMillionTrees movement.",1,18,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00018
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what studies have been conducted on the ambient interior temperature of HDB flats across different times of the day and weather conditions; (b) whether these temperatures are expected to increase, given climate change trends and, if so, by how much; and (c) whether such trends are considered when setting out design specifications for newer HDB projects.",1,19,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00019
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 5 to 7 together, please?",1,20,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00020
2022-08-02-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Please proceed.,1,21,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00021
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,,1,22,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00022
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about the progress and impact of our initiatives to reduce ambient temperatures, such as the introduction of greenery on the top decks of our multi-storey carparks, the use of cool paint on HDB blocks, and the planting of trees in our industrial estates. He also asked whether we select specific tree species or vegetation to provide the most optimal cooling benefits. Dr Tan Wu Meng asked if studies have been conducted on ambient interior temperatures of HDB flats across different times of the day and weather conditions, and if we consider temperature trends in designing new HDB projects.",2,23,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00023
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"As Minister Grace Fu earlier highlighted, the Government adopts a science-based and proactive approach to various aspects of climate adaptation, including the rise in temperatures. BCA requires buildings to be designed to limit heat gain from the exterior, which helps to improve thermal comfort for building occupants. BCA's Green Mark scheme also recognises buildings that implement UHI mitigation measures, such as applying cool paints and providing greenery. In the design of HDB projects, HDB currently deploys various strategies to optimise thermal comfort. For example, our HDB buildings are predominantly oriented in the North-South direction to reduce heat gain. For new towns and estates, HDB conducts environmental modelling to site new flats, design building facades and refine building layouts to harness existing wind corridors and optimise wind flow.",3,24,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00024
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"For existing towns, HDB is conducting a pilot study on cool paint which could absorb less heat and reduce the ambient temperature of HDB blocks. Past trials have shown a reduction of ambient temperatures by up to 2 degrees Celsius. The pilot is expected to be completed in 2024. Based on the study's outcomes, HDB will consider extending the use of cool paint to more estates. Under the HDB Green Towns Programme, which covers all existing HDB towns, HDB is introducing greenery to the top decks of selected multi-storey carparks (MSCPs) in the form of urban farms, community gardens, or rooftop greenery using the Prefabricated Extensive Green (PEG) Roof Tray System based on the suitability of the carparks. These efforts also aim to reduce ambient temperature.",4,25,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00025
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"We are also intensifying greenery in our industrial estates, which are amongst the hotter areas in Singapore. To date, nearly 90,000 trees have been planted in our industrial estates under the OneMillionTrees movement, with the help of our partners and the community. These trees are planted to resemble the look and feel of natural forests, to provide pedestrians with shade and respite from the heat. These efforts have helped to beautify and cool industrial estates, such as Jurong Island, Seletar Aerospace Park and Tuas Industrial Estate, to create greener and more conducive workplaces. We aim to increase the total number of trees across our industrial estates from 180,000 trees today, to about 260,000 trees by 2030.",5,26,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00026
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Studies have shown that intensified tree planting in Singapore can reduce mid-day temperatures in the surrounding areas by up to 0.9 degrees Celsius. We will continue planting more trees across Singapore under the OneMillionTrees movement, to mitigate the effects of climate change and provide Singaporeans with a more liveable and sustainable environment. We are also working with Institutes of Higher Learning to examine the cooling effects of various tree typologies and planting configurations. We will also deploy an island-wide network of sensors to monitor the cooling effects of our tree planting efforts. The data collected will support microclimatic research in Singapore and help NParks develop better greening strategies to cool Singapore.",6,27,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00027
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"In summary, the Government takes a broad-based holistic approach that will help all segments of the population cope with rising temperatures. Dealing with the impacts of climate change requires collective action and community resilience. Together, we will ensure that as a nation, we can adapt, adjust and remain resilient in the face of climate change.",7,28,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00028
2022-08-02-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.,1,29,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00029
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister and the Senior Minister of State for their answers. I have three supplementary questions. Mdm Deputy Speaker, as background, yesterday, in the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer-reviewed report was published by the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. Entitled ""Climate end game  exploring catastrophic climate change scenarios"", it proposes serious consideration of worst-case scenarios in climate crisis. My three questions are as follows.",1,30,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00030
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, the Minister mentioned that the temperature projections might reach peak daytime temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius in Singapore by the year 2040. Can I ask if this a median scenario or have worse, more severe scenarios been considered and are we getting ready for those as well?",2,31,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00031
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Secondly, is the Government considering the possibility of low probability, high-impact situations? For example, if extreme climate situations affect energy resilience, and thereby, the ability of households in Singapore to maintain air-con across the island during a heat wave.",3,32,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00032
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"And thirdly, I am not sure if I had missed the answer, but has the Senior Minister of State from MND mentioned what is the data on the temperature of HDB dwellings across different times of the day, and in particular, whether HDB flats will continue to be safely habitable amidst very high temperatures, even in the absence of air-con?",4,33,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00033
2022-08-02-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Member Dr Tan Wu Meng for his questions, in fact, I am very gratified to see that Members are truly interested in climate change and its impact on Singapore and Singaporeans.",1,34,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00034
2022-08-02-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),It is the greatest challenge to mankind and we should really devote attention and resources to address this global challenge squarely.,2,35,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00035
2022-08-02-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"In our projection, we look at three broad scenarios. One is the business-as-usual scenario; the other is a scenario where we are taking good steps to mitigate emissions; and the third is to assume a situation where fossil fuels continue to be harnessed for energy. This is not a scenario that is determined by Singapore only. This is actually adopted by IPCC, which assesses a collection of thousands of scientific journals and scientific research. It is, in a way, an aggregation of the global thought leadership on climate change issues.",3,36,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00036
2022-08-02-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"So, within these three scenarios, the peak 40 degrees Celsius forms one of the data points. But, obviously, we are looking at the three scenarios squarely and looking at how they would impact Singapore specifically. Because we are quite different from the Northern or Southern hemispheres – we have tropical weather, we are an island, we are not part of large continental masses. So, we do have our own climatic patterns that require careful local study. And that, in fact, is what we will be doing over the next few decades.",4,37,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00037
2022-08-02-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Indeed, I think Dr Tan Wu Meng is very wise to point out that there are low probability but high-impact events. We are constantly in discussions with the scientists. We just hosted the World Climate Research Programme Sea Level Conference in Singapore and had the chance to speak to many world-class climate scientists, which informs our planning.",5,38,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00038
2022-08-02-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"While our long-term planning does not have these specific impact events in mind at this point, we are constantly looking for inputs and they will always shape our planning parameters. I will leave the third question to Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How.",6,39,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00039
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member Dr Tan Wu Meng for his question. At the heart of it, I think he is asking whether HDB plans for the thermal comfort of residents as a priority. I would like to assure Dr Tan that it is indeed so.",1,40,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00040
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we look at the environmental modelling and wind flow, and we consider how the occupants of an HDB building can be comfortable, even during the day. We do not take the assumption that everybody switches on their air-conditioning.",2,41,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00041
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"And perhaps, an additional assurance to Dr Tan, that the HDB Green Towns Programme looks at a 10-year plan to make HDB towns more sustainable and liveable.",3,42,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00042
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"To his question about the energy consumption of HDB towns, it is something that we are concerned about. The HDB Green Towns Programme, which I mentioned, focuses on reducing energy consumption, recycling rainwater and cooling HDB towns. We aim to reduce the energy consumption in HDB towns by 15% from 2020's level, by 2030.",4,43,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00043
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"I would like to add on about thermal comfort. We look at passive strategies in the design of these buildings to optimise thermal comfort. Like I mentioned, we do not make the assumption that everybody switches on the air-conditioning. Thus far, wind flow is the main focus of HDB's effort in thermal comfort design. For new towns and estates, HDB conducts environmental modelling to site the new flats – I mentioned about the North-South facing earlier – but also, we look at the building design facades and in refining the building layouts, the room layouts, to maximise the wind corridors and optimise wind flow. A specific example includes orienting the HDB buildings in the North-South direction and requiring 45% to 60% green cover in new estates to ensure sufficient greenery to create a comfortable living environment for all Singaporeans.",5,44,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00044

2022-08-02-T-002,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. This is in relation to some of the responses that Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How has provided. This is a follow-up supplementary question on that.",1,46,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00046
2022-08-02-T-002,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I understand that in relation to the HDB Green Towns Programme, there will be more features that will be introduced by HDB. In this regard, I wish to make a proposal to HDB for consideration. For many of our existing HDB flats, we incorporate full glass windows that admit a considerable amount of heat during the late afternoon. So, my question is whether HDB can consider installing the low-heat transfer, double-glazed windows for BTOs moving forward, and also, as part of the features for existing HDB flats as part of the Home Improvement Programme (HIP)?",2,47,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00047
2022-08-02-T-002,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"This will really help, because, apart from new methods that HDB is introducing, for example, cool painting, I believe that there is a dire need for us to consider, to explore other suitable greener alternatives that help cool down HDB flats, especially since more Singaporeans are now adopting flexible working arrangements and working from home.",3,48,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00048
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"I thank the Member Ms Hany Soh for her questions. I fully agree that windows are a very important part of the HDB living residential unit. As earlier mentioned, the flow of the wind and the natural ventilation are important strategies to keep the thermal temperature within units comfortable for the residents.",1,49,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00049
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"We will certainly look into the suggestions by Ms Hany Soh – about the use of double-glazed windows to minimise heat transfers. These are some of the areas that we are always studying with the research institutes, as well as our partners.",2,50,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00050
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Perhaps, just to give a little bit more assurance to Ms Hany Soh, I will explain how we design windows. Today, windows are provided with canopies, which provide sun shading and shielding from rain. The windows are also designed with larger, openable panels, as well as smaller top hung windows, such that the large panels are closed during heavy rain, while the top hung windows can still be opened slightly to provide natural ventilation within the flat.",3,51,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00051
2022-08-02-T-002,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"So, windows and how they are designed and the ventilation flows arising from that, are important design considerations for HDB.",4,52,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00052

2022-08-02-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"This report states that climate change intensifies not only the urban heat island effect, but also causes health, social and economic challenges.",2,55,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00055
2022-08-02-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"So, I would like to know, in terms of these cross-Ministerial, whole-of-Government issues, which Ministry or agency is responsible for leading the cross-agency plans and coordination to address these challenges?",3,56,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00056
2022-08-02-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"One of my supplementary questions would be what are the efforts to raise awareness of heat injuries in groups, such as the elderly, parents of young children and people who work outdoors more, because obviously these groups are more exposed to the heat, which will only intensify as the years go on?",4,57,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00057
2022-08-02-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Again, I refer to India's Heat Action Plan, for example, which identifies high-risk populations and groups, and increases outreach and communications about the dangers of increased heat to these groups.",5,58,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00058
2022-08-02-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"So, I am just wondering, maybe this is something that MSE would be working together with MOH on? I would like to ask whether the Ministers are able to share more information about this at this stage.",6,59,2022-08-02-T-002-S-00059

Ordinary Account (OA) savings is in a liquid account that can be withdrawn at any time for home purchases, for the servicing mortgage loans or other specified purposes, such as investments. Thus, the OA interest rate is pegged to the three-month average fixed deposit and savings rates of our three major local banks, which are DBS, UOB and OCBC.

This was done to reflect the longer duration that CPF OA monies remained with CPF Board. As stated in the CPF Board's press release in May 2022, which announced the CPF interest rates effective from July to September 2022, the local banks' three-month average interest rate was 0.09%.

The Government has maintained the floor rate of 4% for the SMRA since 2008 and we will continue to review this on an annual basis. Therefore, despite the low interest rate environment since the Global Financial Crisis, the Government has continued to pay generous interest rates due to the floor rates. If the pegged rates exceed the floor rates, members will correspondingly earn the higher interest rates on their CPF savings.",4,98,2022-08-02-T-004-S-00098

It has been more than 20 years since. I was wondering whether the Government would consider reviewing this formula. Because, even if you look within the fixed deposits and savings rates for the banks, I just had a look last night – just for DBS, for example, if you look at the 12-month deposit rate, for balances of $20,000 to $50,000, it is 0.05% which is indicated on the CPF Board's website. But for less than $20,000, the amount for a 12-month deposit rate would be 1.15% instead. And I think over the last few days, the various local banks have also raised their interest rates for their savings accounts, such as the Multiplier and so on. So, whether or not these changes in the account types would prompt the CPF Board to review its pegging of the formula?",3,105,2022-08-02-T-004-S-00105

The CPF interest rates, I want to re-emphasise, continue to be attractive. Members below aged 55 can earn up to 5%, while members aged 55 and above can earn up to 6%. Members can also transfer their Ordinary Account monies to the Special or Retirement Account to earn the higher interest rate. And I want to emphasis on this again – the interest rate is risk-free.

And I want to assure him that MTI and ESG are very committed to work with the other Ministries and agencies to support our SMEs, to make the green transformation at the system level for those who are prepared to do so. But we also recognise that there are some SMEs who need to take the first baby steps and this is why we have the Energy Efficiency Grant. The EEG is one of the latest schemes amongst the suite of many other measures – between MTI, MSE, NEA and so on – we have in place to support our businesses to become more energy-efficient.",1,125,2022-08-02-T-005-S-00125

This is a collaboration between NEA and one of our Autonomous University (AU), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). So, what can they do for the SMEs? They will help them provide energy audits, because you need to start with knowing how much energy you are consuming, the whole of the organisation, your production lines and so on. They will also help SMEs build up their local energy efficiency capabilities. And if the SME has Research Scientist Engineers (RSE), they can also work in tandem with them to upskill their engineers and practitioners in energy efficiency.",4,128,2022-08-02-T-005-S-00128

Allow me to take a step back and share why the three sectors, and then, why these six categories? In MTI and ESG, we have been working very closely with our industries, with our SMEs, across all sectors and we know that in the last nine months, it has been difficult, in particular, our SMEs in the food services, food manufacturing and the retail sectors. We know that they tend to have a larger electricity component in their overall business costs. So, we want to help them to see how to manage that and become more competitive and bring the business costs down.",5,129,2022-08-02-T-005-S-00129

Now, this grant will allow the SMEs in these three sectors to obtain a support of up to 70% to adopt energy efficiency equipment in the pre-approved categories that I have mentioned. Why pre-approved? Because we work very closely with NEA's licensing department to pre-approve the equipment, so that the SME applicants will be able to adopt this energy efficient appliances and equipment readily, very quickly and easily as well.",6,130,2022-08-02-T-005-S-00130
2022-08-02-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Let me share with you how we work with NEA to qualify the equipment. Essentially, these six categories are identified based on two key considerations. Number one, what would be the energy efficient technologies behind, whether it is the cooker, hob, refrigerators and so on. And the other one will be based on the High Efficiency Rating by NEA's mandatory energy labelling scheme. I want to assure the Member that, for any SME clients that have other equipment and would like to apply, the applicants may suggest other kinds of equipment or even technology within this six supportable categories that has higher or similar level of energy efficiency. We would like to invite them to make the submission to apply for the review and we certainly will evaluate accordingly.",7,131,2022-08-02-T-005-S-00131

For example, we had formed an internal cross-cluster Staff Well-being Committee in 2019 for clusters to share best practices with one another and provide feedback to MOH on enhancements to improve well-being across all categories of staff. One example of its recommendations was for MOH to look deeper into the issues of abuse and harassment of healthcare workers.

2022-08-02-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the nurses should have adequate rest. But I am just wondering whether MOH can clarify what ""adequate"" means. I think a lot of nurses are sharing that they sometimes end their shift at 9.00 pm or 10.00 pm, and then they are back at work at 7.00 am, and that is insufficient rest for many of them.",2,157,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00157

2022-08-02-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Lastly, for the ancillary care staff, I asked for their median salary as well, but I understand we cannot provide. Still, I think they do help in reducing the nurses' workload. So, if I could ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what is MOH doing in terms of increasing the salary of the ancillary care staff, their career progression, as well as increasing the hiring of these staff members.",4,159,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00159
2022-08-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"I thank the Member for the question. Let me address the first one, in relation to rest hours. There are many different arrangements within the public healthcare institutions in the different clusters on how they actually manage the rest hours amongst the healthcare workers. So, in some clusters, it is about ensuring that they typically work on rotating shifts and they are rostered such that they have adequate rest time within shifts. Guidance has also been given, so that they are given rest time for their breaks. Duty rosters are planned in advance and there are guidelines, so that they are not working consecutively beyond a certain number of days so that they get the rest they needed. Within the working space, they are also given dedicated hall rooms, staggered break times so that they can have sufficient rest.",1,160,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00160
2022-08-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,The reality on the ground is that there are many challenges and these nurses work very hard. There are realities of their workplaces that require them to go beyond their call of duty. We really appreciate that and we know that it has been challenging for the nurses and all the healthcare workers.,2,161,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00161
2022-08-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"So, the key thing is making sure that there is a sufficient number on the ground and that is something that we are continually looking at. The attrition rate is a reflection of this. The numbers that we are looking at in respect of the local nurses are actually stabilising. Our key issue and problems are that we are losing the foreign nurses.",3,162,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00162
2022-08-02-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The second question is related to the ideal nurse-to-patient ratio. This is a function of the type of wards and the work that they do, because it is a function of the care that is needed for the patient. And, as you know, they are all tiered in terms of what specific care needs to be given. So, this is a function of those two. And that is a priority because patient care is important. So, in a lot of the settings, what we are trying to do is also ensuring that they have sufficient time to dedicate to patient care.",4,163,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00163

The issue that we are seeing right now is the fact that we are losing foreign nurses due to the pandemic. Now that the borders are open, they can go back. They are also being attracted by prospects overseas. So, there is international competition and we are losing all these workers. That means that we are losing the numbers on the ground here, locally.",7,166,2022-08-02-T-006-S-00166

2022-08-02-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I would like to thank the Minister of State for her reply. I have two supplementary questions. The first one is  how do these Centres of Innovation serve, assist and benefit the SMEs? The second would be  how does MTI intend to reach out to more SMEs to accelerate the pace of innovation and to foster greater innovation amongst SMEs?",1,183,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00183
2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,I want to thank the Member Desmond Choo for his supplementary questions – I believe there are two.

2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"SMEs can tap on a wide range of resources at the eight COIs, or Centres of Innovation. Each of the Centres of Innovation is a one-stop hub that supports our SMEs' technology innovation efforts, based on a sectorial approach. For example, I talked about the Food Innovation and Resource Centre (FIRC) that is located at Singapore Polytechnic. We have other COIs that focus on environment and water technology, supply chain management – which is located at Republic Polytechnic – and electronics and the Internet of Things.",2,185,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00185

2022-08-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, is there a mechanism whereby our local SMEs can very easily access the IPs, the patents, for example, that are available – from COIs, IHLs, RIs and RCs under A*STAR? Is there perhaps an online mechanism where they can access these patents and see whether they can enter into negotiations to license these patents for their own operations? Notwithstanding that there are occasional meet-ups, gatherings and so on, is there this easy, online matching mechanism, for example?",2,192,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00192
2022-08-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, is there a mechanism for SMEs to inform IHLs and so on about their commercial priorities, so that they can influence the direction of R&D projects?",3,193,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00193
2022-08-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, in the view of the Government, are these mechanisms working well right now to generate commercial impact?",4,194,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00194
2022-08-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Lastly, does the Government regularly benchmark the performance of other IHLs and innovation ecosystems around the world which are noted to be very good at bridging between academic research and commercial impact? I understand the Israelis, for example, are very good at this. They tend to generate very high commercial impact from academic R&D.",5,195,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00195
2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Leon Perera for asking these questions.",1,196,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00196
2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to reassure him that ESG and MTI, as well as A*STAR, work very closely with not just the COIs. I talked about the 80 Technology, Innovation and Enterprise (TIE) centres.",2,197,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00197
2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For SMEs that want to embark on technology innovation, if they want to develop new innovation and new IP that will open up new revenue streams, expand their market opportunities the COI team will work very closely with them on projects with potential that may result in new IP, which can then lead to new revenue streams or even new jobs created.",3,198,2022-08-02-T-007-S-00198

2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"On one of the questions the Member asked, yes, certainly, we work very closely, between A*STAR and EDB.

2022-08-02-T-007,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"MTI, ESG and A*STAR will assess very regularly the effectiveness of these TIE centres, including the COIs. For example, we will assess if they are effective at enhancing our enterprises' competitiveness. ESG will commission an impact study.

2022-08-02-T-008,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the current progress of the reopening of Changi Airport's air routes; (b) how does Changi Airport currently rank amongst regional and global air hubs on connectivity and passenger volume; and (c) what is the projected progress of the reopening of Changi Airport's air routes by end of 2022.,1,205,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00205

2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As of the first week of July 2022, weekly passenger traffic at Changi Airport had recovered to about 55% of 2019's average weekly levels. This is on the back of weekly passenger services by airlines recovering to more than 50% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Changi Airport is also connected to 108 cities by passenger flights as of July 2022, which is more than 65% of the number of cities it was connected to before the pandemic.",1,208,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00208
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The pattern of recovery across the world has been uneven. Air hubs in regions such as Europe, North America and the Middle East, which reopened their borders earlier, have seen a faster recovery. International passenger traffic at the Middle Eastern air hubs of Dubai, Doha and Istanbul had recovered to more than 90% of their pre-COVID-19 levels even before June 2022. The connectivity at these hubs, in terms of international city links, is also at 90% or more of pre-COVID-19 levels as of June 2022.",2,209,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00209
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Within the Asia Pacific region, Changi Airport is leading the recovery. As of June 2022, compared to the major Asia Pacific air hubs, such as Incheon, Hong Kong and Bangkok, Changi Airport is ahead in terms of both international passenger traffic and city links vis-a-vis pre-COVID-19 levels.",3,210,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00210
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Demand for air travel remains fundamentally strong. We expect the recovery at Changi Airport to continue and to gather pace when key markets in Northeast Asia, including Mainland China, Hong Kong and Japan, fully reopen their borders.",4,211,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00211
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To ensure that Changi Airport will be ready to manage the anticipated traveller flows, the Changi Airport Group has announced that it will reopen Terminal 4 from 13 September and commence departure operations in the southern wing of Terminal 2 from October. This will enable the airport to handle up to pre-COVID-19 passenger traffic levels, or about 70 million passengers per annum, which represents about 80% of Changi Airport's pre-COVID-19 capacity.",5,212,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00212

Just one supplementary question, which is essentially my Parliamentary Question, in terms of the target passenger numbers for this year, as well as next year.",1,216,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00216
2022-08-02-T-008,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I ask that because I think STB has put out a visitor arrivals target of about four to six million this year versus 1.5 million in the first half of the year. That would enable the various supply chain partners to better project their own internal capacities to plan ahead, should there be a faster than expected ramp-up in passenger numbers coming through.",2,217,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00217

2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I thank the Member for his question. As I said, it is difficult to set the target at this stage of our recovery for the total volume of passengers that can come in. The reason is simply because the source markets are at different stages of managing the recovery from COVID-19. Key markets like China, Japan and Northeast Asia in general, are still working their way through and we are not sure when exactly and how exactly they will make further changes.",1,219,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00219
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"With that in mind, having set an initial 50% target which has been well and truly met and exceeded, our focus now is to prepare our aviation ecosystem and Changi Airport in particular, for a potential volume of about 70 million, which is at about the level that it was pre-COVID-19. And it is about 80% or so of the pre-COVID-19 capacity of Changi Airport.",2,220,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00220
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"That, in itself, is no mean feat. What it means is we have to now further ramp up manpower. As I have shared with Members before, we have had an attrition of about one-third of the workforce in the aviation ecosystem over the course of COVID-19. Recovering from that, not just in terms of recruitment but in terms of making sure that the manpower is operationally ready, is a major challenge. One only has to consider the experience in many other airports around the world to appreciate the enormity of the task.",3,221,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00221
2022-08-02-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, our focus, in response to the Member's question, is to ramp up capacity and as part of that effort, reopen Terminal 4, and also have both departure and arrival operations in the southern part of Terminal 2 and all of these to be fully executed by October, so that we are prepared for the year-end peak travel season.",4,222,2022-08-02-T-008-S-00222

2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"MINDEF had provided all relevant facts of NS liabilities for new citizens in a written answer to his Parliamentary Question that he had filed for that same Sitting in July. I quote in full MINDEF's reply  ""Under the Enlistment Act, all male Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents between the ages of 18 and 40 for non-officers and 50 for officers are liable to serve National Service (NS).

2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Even before the July Sitting, Mr Leong had been repeating these misleading statements in two Facebook posts  one in late May and another on 1 July. In late May, I quote  ""Is it fair for foreigners to be given citizenship without doing NS while our locally-born Singaporeans have to serve NS despite having valid reasons to defer?"" For his Facebook post in July, I quote  ""Is it fair that we forfeit our local talents their chances of developing their talents while many new male citizens do not need to do NS?""",7,232,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00232
2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let there be no doubt that for every young male citizen, whether by birth, registration or descent, the NS liabilities are the same. We do not differentiate. They will be enlisted for NS at 18 years or older to perform full-time NS, and thereafter must fulfil their Operationally Ready NS (ORNS) duties. That is universal and equitable.",8,233,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00233
2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"But if a foreigner comes to Singapore and becomes a citizen as a mature adult, typically in his 30s or 40s, we exempt him from NS because he did not enjoy any socioeconomic benefits like young Singaporeans and also because he would be too old to enlist for full time NS.",9,234,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00234
2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"On a topic as important as NS, Mr Leong should have waited for MINDEF's reply or sought the full facts. This policy is not new; in fact, it dates back at least to the early 1980s. We had to go some way back to find out when the policy started. But it is, at least, more than 40 years.

2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"For example, back in 2007, then-Minister of State for Defence Assoc Prof Koo Tsai Kee had already made clear that  ""Each year, we have a number of new citizens in full-time NS. They are born foreign nationals, they took up permanent residency, but have since been naturalised as Singapore Citizens. Like those who are born Singaporeans, they are enlisted for full-time NS upon reaching enlistment age and contribute to Operationally Ready NS thereafter.""",11,236,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00236
2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"It is also easy to get the relevant information on the Internet. And you can try it even now. If you key in in your search engine  ""NS, new citizens, Singapore"", it pops up. Many fora make it known that new young male citizens must do NS and that those who become citizens as mature adults are exempted. So, this policy is well publicised on the Internet too.",12,237,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00237
2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"This long-standing policy has served our defence needs. Over the years, Permanent Residents (PRs) and young male new citizens have formed an increasing proportion of NS enlistees. In the early 2000s, they were about 5% of all full-time national servicemen (NSFs) enlisted each year. In other words, PRs and young male new citizens formed 5% in the early 2000s. Today, they form about 20% of all NSFs enlisted. Of the 20%, slightly more than half are citizens by registration, with the remaining as PRs.",13,238,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00238
2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"So, what Mr Leong asserts is not true. Many new citizens are enlisted for NS every year. New citizens and PRs are contributing to our national defence.

2022-08-02-T-009,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I have decided that it is important to correct the misleading statements put out by Mr Leong, because they strike at the foundations of equity and universality that underpin National Service in Singapore. Just think about it – if pre-enlistees are misled into thinking that new citizens of their age are exempted, where will they have the heart to serve NS?

2022-08-02-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, then I ask the Minister  what is the number of new citizens who did not do NS? You still have to give me that number. It does not mean that 10% of our annual enlistment now consists of new citizens, then all the new citizens have performed NS, right?",1,252,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00252

2022-08-02-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think the Minister opened up the debate. And now, he is running away from the debate. So, I will ask one more question. He told me, through my Parliamentary Question last month and he said again just now, that there were 3,400 new citizens and PRs who enlisted every year, on the average.",1,261,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00261

Since 2000, on average, 3,400 new citizens are registered each year, who have been or will be enlisted like all male Singaporeans to serve their NS duties.

2022-08-02-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,My clarification is  what is the number of new citizens who have not performed NS? The number the Minister has given only forms a subset of the new citizens. It does not form the whole new citizens' number.,1,272,2022-08-02-T-009-S-00272

I would like to propose that the debate on both Bills take place together, as the two Bills deal with the same substantive matter of the new SAF service to be stood up.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam and Members of this House, the legislation that governs militaries around the world is not often amended. So, I do not stand on this podium very often, and for good reasons.",1,285,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00285
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The mandate and powers provided to the military are clear and focused, and necessarily scoped by Parliament to keep within this remit. In peace, that legislation is usually adequate for the Armed Forces' crucial task of national defence, to organise themselves to build capabilities and protect the sovereignty and security of her country. For militaries that are often at war, or operating in periods of tension, legislative changes are more frequent, as varied conditions require timely adaptations. But during peace, one does not expect frequent changes to legal provisions. So, too, the SAF. The last time the SAF Act was amended was in 2009 to introduce the Military Domain Experts Scheme for SAF. We are thankful that Singapore has enjoyed a period of prolonged peace since our Independence.",2,286,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00286
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Nonetheless, the amendments put to this House today represent a significant change militarily to establish a new fourth service, the Digital and Intelligence Service, or DIS in short, alongside the Army, Navy and Air Force services which the SAF Act of 1972 brought into existence.",3,287,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00287
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There will be other amendments which I will go through with Members, and they are related to discipline and administrative processes to update and to ensure the smooth functioning of SAF.",4,288,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00288
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The SAF, incepted 57 years ago in 1965, has been a military constantly on the move. And that transformation is visible. All of you would have witnessed it through the years growing up; NSmen lived through it and some here are actually responsible for pieces of that transformation. From 13-tonne AMX-13 light tanks to 70-tonne Leopard main battle tanks; wooden hull ships to stealth frigates; Hawker Hunters to F16s, F15s and, in a few years, F35s, the SAF today is a modernised military, capable of prosecuting missions across the spectrum of security threats.",5,289,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00289
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Singaporeans, too, have seen this SAF journey every year, through the National Day Parades (NDPs) when we allow SAF to play on the Floating Platform, Padang or National Stadium and into the heartlands. That display will take place in a few days' time on 9 August. I hope that Members will enjoy the dynamic display.",6,290,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00290
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We, in this House, and Singaporeans out there are not the only ones who have noticed this impressive and progressive march. The Asian Military Review described the SAF as ""one of the most well-trained and equipped forces in Asia Pacific"". That others notice the SAF's competency and growing ability is good, and the core of deterrence.",7,291,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00291
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Today's amendment, if approved by this House, will set up under the SAF Act a formal fourth service – DIS – and should be seen in the continuum of improvements for the SAF over the past 57 years.",8,292,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00292
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For SAF commanders and troops, DIS affects primarily the intelligence community, and we call it the C4I community – Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence. So, let me shift focus there to explain what needs to be done and why, by the DIS.",9,293,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00293
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To protect Singapore, the Army, Navy and Air Force have built up capabilities in their respective domains on land, at sea and air. But it is not enough for each service to do so. Command and control are essential to maximise effects by orchestrating joint efforts, so that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Pari passu, intelligence capabilities had to grow in tandem, to keep pace.",10,294,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00294
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The C4I community has been growing alongside the three kinetic services, less visible but no less progressive. C4I operations have grown over the years, too, for example, in counter-terrorism, from our operations, from our NDPs to key high-security multilateral events, like the Trump-Kim Summit and ASEAN Summit in 2018. C4I soldiers were deployed for counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations in Kuwait and Afghanistan. Our imagery analyst teams were part of the Combined Joint Task Force Headquarters in Kuwait from 2014 to 2016. Then-US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter expressed his appreciation for their contributions which helped stop ISIS' terror campaign.",11,295,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00295
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Even despite these impressive developments and achievements hitherto, the C4I community's role has been largely that of a supporting agency, akin to combat support, logistics and maintenance. They enable the Army, Navy and Air Force to achieve their missions by providing actionable timely intelligence and ensuring that communications are secure to execute plans. And these responsibilities will still be part of DIS.",12,296,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00296
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, what then has changed to require DIS to be a fully-fledged military service arm? Simply put, the battleground. The digital domain, just like air, land and sea, has become a battle terrain which, if left unguarded, can impact the security and sovereignty of any country. And over the years, I have updated Members in this House about these security threats.",13,297,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00297
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In 2015, I spoke about ""hybrid warfare"", ""an orchestrated campaign"" which ""integrates the use of conventional and unconventional tools of warfare"" to ""fracture the solidarity of the target nation"". I quoted former Chief of General Staff of the Russian Federation, General Valery Gerasimov, who said, ""The very rules of war have changed. The role of non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness."" Reflect on this statement. We are all familiar with the dictum ""political power grows out of the barrel of the gun"". But the ""Gerasimov Doctrine"" upends it. And he says, ""In many cases, the non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals have exceeded the power of the force of weapons"". I described this concept as the exact antagonist of our Total Defence concept. To respond to the growing prevalence of hybrid warfare back then, I pointed out that SAF will have to contend with cyber threats and the growing use of disinformation in warfare.",14,298,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00298
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In 2016, I shared about the unidentified hackers attacking Ukraine's power grid and disrupting electricity. In 2017, the Financial Times wrote on cyber warfare. In 2019, we introduced Digital Defence as the sixth pillar of Total Defence. Looking back over those years, this generation is witnessing real-time, and personally, the changing face of warfare.",15,299,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00299
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Even as the public experiences it first-hand, this realisation by militaries of vulnerabilities and opportunities within the digital domain has not been uniform. Some militaries adapted earlier than others to the ""Gerasimov Doctrine"" and have steadily been building capabilities on many fronts, including the digital domain, for example, the German military that incorporated a new service, as we are proposing today, in 2017, to defend the digital domain. The Baltic States I visited recently have also beefed up their capabilities in their military and civilian organisations against digital threats.",16,300,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00300
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Apart from states, non-state actors have also recognised that they can use the digital domain to achieve their ends, particularly terror cells. Whether to recruit vulnerable inductees, spread false propaganda, supply funds, procure weapons, sabotage or bypass state security systems, these areas have become standard fare for terrorist networks.",17,301,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00301
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"From a security perspective, we should ask, ""what will be the scale of these digital threats going forward and can they threaten the well-being of citizens and even the entire country?"" The questions are, of course, rhetorical and I think every Member here knows and agrees that these threats can only grow and have a very real physical impact on any country that is unprepared.",18,302,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00302
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We are all convinced because we have seen for ourselves the many forms of cyber intrusions that develop quickly, even within the past few years. Cyber intrusions can affect many critical systems. Last year, we saw the Colonial Pipeline cyber attack that cut off gas supplies to many South and East Coast states in the United States and disrupted the lives of countless people. Earlier this year in February, a cyber attack on the European telco, Vodafone, restricted cellular communications for millions of people in Portugal. It will be horrendous, but not unthinkable, about the potential fallout from attacks on water systems, hospitals, air traffic, trains, financial systems, pension systems – the list goes on.",19,303,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00303
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In fact, cyber threats, disparate in form and source, occur in the thousands, even millions, each day. However, they should be differentiated from the ones that have the most pernicious intent and seek to undermine our nation's sovereignty or security.",20,304,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00304
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For the SAF, it has asked itself this simple question, just as it does if the threat came from air, land or sea  how does it detect, mitigate or repel any potential aggressor, an orchestrated cyber attack by state and non-state actors that mean to do Singapore and Singaporeans harm? The first response, just like the Army, Navy and Air Force, is that it will need a dedicated service to raise, train and sustain cyber troops and capabilities to defend our digital borders. In the digital domain, the fourth service is the force on the frontline, as it should be.",21,305,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00305
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We are thankful that hitherto, our intelligence agencies have not detected any campaign against Singapore of that nature in the digital domain. But we should not wait for one and it would be prudent to start and build up the fourth service now. That alone would serve as a deterrent.",22,306,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00306
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"As with the mission of the three existing services, DIS will ensure Singapore is defended against the full spectrum of threats against potential aggressors. The digital environment is more porous than the physical one, but DIS will be responsible to guard against these aggressors in that domain.",23,307,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00307
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For the SAF, DIS will protect its networks and systems and strengthen our soldiers' commitment and resilience in operations.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Sections 7(1) and 2(2)(c) are amended to include DIS as a Service under the SAF. This also requires related changes to other Acts to ensure that the legal statutes can be properly applied to DIS soldiers as well. Therefore, section 2(1) of the Interpretation Act 1965 and section 27(5) of the Wills Act 1838 are amended to respectively include DIS in the definition of ""military"" when used in relation to Singapore's military, and to include in the definition of ""soldier"", a reference to a DIS serviceman. Section 21(2) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 is amended to include DIS within the scope of that provision.",27,311,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00311

Like the Service Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force, the CDI will be a member of the Armed Forces Council and have legal powers to discharge his or her duties and authority to lead DIS in times of conflict. Sections 2(1), 8(1), and 8B(2) are amended to effect these changes.",28,312,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00312
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Based on the SAF Act and Constitution, the Chief of Defence Force and Service Chiefs are appointed by the President acting in her discretion.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,Let me deal with disciplinary provisions. Section 111 is amended to allow the three-year limitation period for the trial of offences in military courts to commence later in certain situations. Let me explain.,31,315,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00315

The creation of the armed forces for Independent Singapore started with the Singapore Army Act in December 1965. The creation of the Singapore Navy and Air Force followed in 1967 and 1968 respectively. These three services have formed the core of Singapore's armed forces ever since.

But given the importance of this appointment, I think it is necessary to have this safeguard. The one clarification I have, though, is if the DIS chief is in the same line as the Chiefs of the Navy, Army and Air Force, this actually means that that person could potentially be a target in times of war. But if this person happens to be a civilian, then, is that really the intention of this Bill? That is a simple clarification.

These could include ""soft kills"" that damage key operating software or hardware without kinetic action, such as through hacking. The objective is to weaken the target country by compromising its core systems. Cyber warfare takes many forms. Cyber attackers may conduct espionage using spear-phishing attacks to gain remote access to an adversary's computer to extract sensitive information. They may hack critical infrastructure like the electrical power grid, which will disrupt communications and even cause deaths if, say, life-supporting medical equipment is shut down. Or they may crash modern economic facilities like banks and payment systems. Propaganda attacks may be employed to control the hearts and minds of the people living in the targeted country or make them lose faith in their own country and sympathise with the enemy.",2,372,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00372

With the digitalisation of almost everything, the cyber threat is increasing by the day. Up until recently, a war was usually fought by sending the air force to bomb the target nation's critical infrastructure and defence installations before any ground troops were sent in. In modern warfare, cyber attacks are likely to be one of the first modes of attack, because they can be employed so easily without any detection – the Gerasimov doctrine, which the Minister alluded to earlier in his speech.",3,373,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00373

2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I hope DIS, CSA, HTX and GovTech plan to establish a common communication platform, so as to not only share information occasionally but actively work together on a regular basis to counter the cyber threats that Singapore faces. I note that a Digital Ops-Tech Centre will be established as a centre of excellence for SAF's digital expertise, partnering with the Defence Tech Community, whole-of-Government digital agencies, academia and the industry, to remain innovative in its approaches and culture. Could the Minister elaborate more on how this partnership will work in practice?",8,378,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00378
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The DIS will likely have significant capabilities and powers to intrude in the private space of the functionaries of would-be adversaries. What protections are in place to make sure that such capabilities are not turned on citizens or abused? It is necessary in any developed democracy to put in place legal safeguards and channels for recourse to prevent the abuse of power by current and future governments. One form of oversight would be for MINDEF to provide confidential reports to a cross-party Parliamentary Select Committee for Defence, which can then scrutinise those reports and ask questions in a confidential setting.",9,379,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00379
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I note that DIS will focus efforts to attract and develop both military and non-uniformed digital experts to grow SAF's digital workforce. Will the need for a high level of security clearance mean that DIS will hire only Singapore Citizens? Will DIS be engaging technology contractors to supplement their own manpower? If so, how will it ensure that the contractors and their employees, who may be reporting to foreign managers based in other countries, how will they ensure that they would not leak sensitive information?",10,380,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00380
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Members will recall how Edward Snowden, who leaked highly classified information from the US National Security Agency (NSA), was not an NSA employee but a contractor with a consulting firm hired by the agency. The need for security clearance will naturally limit the pool of manpower available to DIS, in what is already a very competitive labour market for tech talent. This will make it a challenge to find sufficient local tech talent to join DIS. In fact, the introduction of the DIS could further draw talent away from the private sector, as many Singaporean tech workers are likely to be attracted to the pay, benefits and job stability that DIS has to offer.",11,381,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00381
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In order to expand the pool of tech manpower, our Polytechnics and local Universities must urgently increase enrolment in IT and technology-related majors. This is a point I raised before in this House. More funding should be provided to our local institutions to achieve this. This will benefit the recruitment pipeline of both DIS and the private sector.",12,382,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00382
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I am glad to know that NSFs and NSmen with tech talents will be leveraged to support the SAF's digital core. The Central Manpower Base should identify such talents early, even before enlistment, so that they can be drafted into the DIS during their full-time National Service and later during their Operationally-ready NS cycles.",13,383,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00383
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Next, zero-day vulnerabilities are software or hardware bugs in systems that have yet to be discovered or patched by the developer or manufacturer. When governments or individuals discover these ""zero-days"", they can create software code to exploit the vulnerabilities, known as ""zero-day exploits"". Zero-day exploits can potentially enable their owner to access sensitive information in other computer systems or take control of those systems remotely, often undetected. One of the most well-known zero-day exploits is Stuxnet, a cyber operation that sabotaged Iranian nuclear centrifuges.",14,384,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00384
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I would assume, but will not ask the Minister to confirm, that the role of DIS will include building capabilities to conduct offensive cyber operations. In the course of this, DIS may discover and stockpile zero-day vulnerabilities in operating systems that run critical infrastructure and the military networks of potential adversaries. It would be natural for DIS to want to keep the knowledge of these exploits secret, so that our potential adversaries do not patch their systems and DIS maintains its offensive capability.",15,385,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00385
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"However, there is an offence-defence trade-off between stockpiling zero-day exploits and helping other local Government agencies and private organisations patch these vulnerabilities so our own critical infrastructure does not get hacked by others.",16,386,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00386
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In 2016, a group of hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers released a cache of top-secret cyber spying capabilities that likely belonged to NSA. Some of these included zero-day exploits, which could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in products produced by companies like CISCO, Juniper and Fortinet, that protect US companies and critical infrastructure. The existence of these zero-days raised questions about whether NSA should have told the vendors about these vulnerabilities, so that the vendors could patch them.",17,387,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00387
2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The US Government has a policy, whereby, any agency that wishes to keep a zero-day exploit has to argue their case through what is known as a Vulnerability Equities Process (VEP). The VEP comprises an Equities Review Board chaired by the National Security Council and attended by senior officials from agencies concerned with the security of critical infrastructure, like the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Commerce. This Board reportedly meets quite regularly.",18,388,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00388

2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The last point I wish to raise concerns the potential for commercialising defence technologies to benefit Singapore. Many technologies that we use every day originated from military technology. The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, invented TCP/IP, which is the plumbing that makes the Internet possible. The Global Positioning System, or GPS, was originally developed by the US Department of Defense and is now used in almost all our mobile phones. Israel is widely recognised as a ""startup nation"". Many of Israel's high-tech companies were founded by soldiers who completed their National Service in Unit 8200, the Intelligence Corps of the Israel Defense Forces.",20,390,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00390

2022-08-02-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I note that this Bill is enhancing the existing maximum punishments under the SAF Act, which can be awarded for certain offences, as well as by the relevant officers assigned to officiate summary trials.",12,444,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00444
2022-08-02-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Clauses 12 to 7 increase the current fine amounts that may be awarded in a summary trial by a disciplinary officer or a senior disciplinary committee. Besides the reasons given by the hon Minister in his speech for the enhancement of the punishment under the SAF Act, may I also ask the Minister whether there has been a significant or proportionate increase in summary trials and our convictions at summary trials in the last five or 10 years. And, if so, whether this plays a part in the Government deciding to enhance the punishments? Can the Minister share with the House, the number of summary trials carried out each year in the past five years?",13,445,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00445
2022-08-02-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),The last point I would like to raise relates to clause 37 of the Bill which proposes to amend section 7 of the Military Manoeuvres Act to permit the SAF to carry out military manoeuvres in catchment areas with the approval of PUB.,14,446,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00446
2022-08-02-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"While military action can occur across any geographic feature and training has to be as realistic as possible, the impact of military equipment could well be damaging and polluting to the waterways and its surroundings.",15,447,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00447
2022-08-02-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I would like to know, besides approval, what oversight of the military exercises will PUB have? Does PUB have complete say in its pre-exercise or pre-training assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed SAF training? Does PUB have a continuing duty to supervise the training being carried out on the ground, so that PUB is able to ensure that the actual environmental impact of any SAF training in any of its public reservoirs or waterways is minimised? If not, can PUB be given such a power to supervise the actual use of its lands and waterways by the SAF?",16,448,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00448
2022-08-02-T-011,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.,1,449,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00449
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. The establishment of the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) as SAF's fourth standalone arm is timely. But this is also not new to SAF. Over the past decade, MINDEF and SAF have built up what is known as the SAF C4I Community – Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence – along with the establishment of the Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO) in 2017. The Bill will allow SAF to develop and scale up its operational capabilities to respond to modern welfare.",1,450,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00450
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I will speak on three key areas  the importance of DIS, ways to expand the manpower catchment pool for DIS and the projected scale and size of the outfit.",2,451,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00451
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the security threats we now face are no longer limited to the traditional battlefield. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been weaponised; the use of cyber warfare has increased over the years. We can either scale up and incorporate advanced technologies in our Armed Forces, or increasingly falter behind other countries. In addition, DIS can, and must, leverage new technological capabilities to make up for our manpower constraints. The number of NSmen is projected to fall in the next decade. DIS can make up for manpower constraints by integrating and expanding our capabilities in the virtual terrain.",3,452,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00452
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),Talent pool is critical for any tech outfit to succeed. I would like to offer three suggestions for the Ministry to consider.,4,453,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00453
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, on grappling with the war on tech talent in Singapore and, in fact, globally. Competition for tech talent in Singapore will continue to be heated with firms aggressively raising wages and other benefits. For example, surveys have surfaced that Big Tech firms, such as Amazon Web Services, Meta, Apple and Google, are dangling some of the highest salaries in the market. These salaries are pegged up to 56.5% more than the market median, according to a latest survey. Other top talents command even higher salaries and that is straight from school.",5,454,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00454
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"A key difference between working for DIS and private companies is undoubtedly the mission in serving the nation. Yet, wages are a hygiene factor that we must address. Can the Ministry share its plans to effectively attract top talent, considering the intense competition from Big Tech firms and startups? How do we also attract Singaporean talent currently working overseas?",6,455,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00455
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, on improving youth inflow to DIS. Digital natives are clearly the future backbone of DIS. In some countries, many 18 to 21-year-olds are selected to join military and intelligence services even while in school. Preparatory programmes are offered to them to develop their skills and also pique their interest in serving the nation in the longer run.",7,456,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00456
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),We could explore the possibility of developing such feeder programmes for our youths. I believe this would suitably complement the top-tier scholarships for digital and intelligence talents for which the Ministry has already planned.,8,457,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00457
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, on career conversions within SAF. As service in the DIS may not be as physically demanding as compared to the existing tri-services of SAF, joining DIS may be a tenable pathway for mid-career SAF servicemen or Singaporeans. Would the Ministry to consider structuring a pathway for mid-career conversions? What are the plans to help mid-career servicemen and women to similarly be trained and transit to DIS?",9,458,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00458
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Many countries are already ahead of us in formalising a cyber warfare force in addition to their tri-services. Examples of these include Norway's Cyber Defence Force, founded in 2012, and the United States Cyber Command, founded in 2010.",10,459,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00459
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"While the SAF's C4I Community has been the backbone of the SAF's digital intelligence services over the past decade, the formal establishment of DIS will enable us to scale up our digital capabilities efficiently and effectively. Could the Ministry share the intended scale of DIS in terms of manpower? Is it also envisioned for DIS to partner with GovTech and other related Government tech agencies as part of the whole-of-Government digital security infrastructure roadmap?",11,460,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00460
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Could the Ministry also share how DIS will strive to keep its knowledge current and cutting-edge, tapping on partnership with the private sector?",12,461,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00461
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my clarifications and suggestions, I reiterate my support of the Bill. The DIS will ensure that our nation is well-equipped to adapt and conquer the evolving face of modern warfare. It is also, perhaps, the most significant stride thus far towards building a truly future-proof Next Gen SAF.",13,462,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00462
2022-08-02-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next week, as other Members in this House have also recognised, Singapore will be celebrating our 57th birthday. The sovereignty we enjoy today did not come easy and we must never take the peace we enjoy today for granted. Ultimately, the success of SAF's mission to safeguard our nation's sovereignty is dependent on the commitment of our servicemen and servicewomen. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",14,463,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00463
2022-08-02-T-011,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.,1,464,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00464
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, Singapore must guard against cyber attacks and the creation of DIS is an important move in the right direction.",1,465,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00465
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have four areas of clarification for this Bill.,2,466,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00466
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification is on the possible intrusion of DIS' activities on civilian life. DIS has been given a broad remit to tackle cyber threats. Its work will reportedly include cyber incidents response, network monitoring, vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. Because its powers are so extensive, there will be concerns that, in its mission to defend Singapore's national security, DIS may track the lives and activities of average Singaporeans, even when there is no clear and significant security purpose.",3,467,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00467
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister share what checks are in place to ensure that DIS' extensive powers are not misused? How will the Ministry and DIS draw the line between reasonable counterintelligence and excessive surveillance?,4,468,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00468
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second area of clarification is on the composition of offences. Compounding an offence is significant because it means that no further criminal proceedings will be brought against an accused upon payment of a composition sum. In this Bill, the new section 79A allows certain offences to be compounded, similar to the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC).",5,469,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00469
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have several questions arising from a comparison of this Bill and the CPC.,6,470,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00470
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, this Bill does not provide for the compounding of the abetment of, conspiracy to commit and attempt to commit a compoundable offence, even though the CPC does. Can the Minister clarify if the schedule to the SAF Act will clarify if such offences may be compounded?",7,471,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00471
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, this Bill does not state that a composition has the effect of an acquittal, even though the CPC does. Can the Minister clarify if a composition under the SAF Act will either be a ""discharge amounting to an acquittal"" or a ""discharge not amounting to an acquittal""?",8,472,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00472
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If a composition will have the effect of a ""discharge not amounting to an acquittal"", can the Minister clarify whether a composition for a military offence will be considered an antecedent for  first, future military offences and second, civil offences?",9,473,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00473
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, section 243(1) of the CPC provides that a person authorised under any Act aside from the Penal Code to compound offences must exercise the power of composition subject to the general or special directions of the Public Prosecutor.",10,474,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00474
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify if the Public Prosecutor will provide directions for how authorised composition officers should exercise their composition powers? Will every composition decision be subject to the review and authorisation of the Public Prosecutor?,11,475,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00475
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third clarification is on the increased penalties for offences.,12,476,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00476
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The amended section 118 will triple the maximum amount of its fine. Can the Minister share how it arrived at this significant increase? Were the fines benchmarked against punishments provided under other pieces of legislation? Can the Minister also share whether clear sentencing guidelines will be set by the military court to address the transition from the previous ranges for fines to the updated ranges? This is essential, given that the previous sentencing precedents will no longer provide a useful guide on the likely quantum of fines.",13,477,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00477
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final clarification is on the limitation period. The Bill amends section 111 to provide that the limitation period of three years, where there are Police investigations or civil proceedings involved, only commences at the end of those processes or of the sentence of imprisonment, detention or reformative training.",14,478,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00478
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Military courts do, of course, benefit from waiting for the conclusion of civil proceedings and sentences. But we have to balance this against the experience of the accused, who face the prospect of a military trial hanging over their heads for many years.",15,479,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00479
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Police investigations and civil proceedings can take years to complete. Sentences of imprisonment, detention or training can take years to complete.",16,480,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00480
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Taken together, the accused may have to wait for years, even decades, before their limitation period starts counting down. Can the Minister share if there are specific cases that have prompted such a significant amendment? For instance, were there cases where the three-year limitation period expired while civil proceedings were still ongoing and it negatively affected the conduct of military proceedings?",17,481,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00481
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Relatedly, can the Minister share if the military court will also consider the impact of the preceding civil proceedings and any sentences served by the accused for related civil offences when imposing a sentence for the military offences?",18,482,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00482
2022-08-02-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",19,483,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00483

2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill and the establishment of Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) of the SAF.",1,485,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00485
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Today's battleground is shaped not only by kinetic weapons of war, but by a potent blend of data, technology and innovation that forms our digital world.",2,486,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00486
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In this age of increased information warfare and information-enabled warfare, the way these advances are deployed will be pivotal in achieving a competitive advantage over adversaries. In an interview, Major-General Robin Anderton-Brown, a director at UK Strategic Command in the UK Ministry of Defence stated  ""The term 'domain' in a military sense reflects the fact we traditionally considered Defence in terms of the environmental domains of maritime, land and air, but now there is the growing importance of space – a domain in its own right – as well as the virtual domain of cyber, which affects not just Defence but the whole of society.""",3,487,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00487
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Other jurisdictions have had similar services. In the US, its Army Cyber Command integrates and conducts cyberspace operations, electromagnetic warfare, and information operations, to ensure dominance in the cyber domain and information warfare. The UK established its National Cyber Force (NCF), which is a partnership between defence and intelligence in 2020. There is, hence, a need for MINDEF to take the lead here. In Malay, please.",4,488,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00488

We have seen examples, through online campaigns, where terrorist organisations, such as ISIS, recruits and mobilises their members to carry out attacks.",5,489,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00489
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),We have also seen the presence of foreign influence in the 2016 United States presidential elections.,6,490,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00490
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In times of war, the battlefield is not just about conventional warfare, but we also need to strengthen defence in cyberspace. This is due to cyber attacks and hackings of key institutions with sensitive information. Besides cyber attacks, information operations should also be addressed collectively. An example is the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, where there has been the deployment of information warfare comprising disinformation campaigns and false-flag videos that aim to deceive the public. These were harnessed to influence public opinion and manipulate information to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and break their defensive spirit.",7,491,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00491
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Therefore, when faced with such scenarios, we need MINDEF and the SAF to spearhead our information defence in both wartime and peacetime.",8,492,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00492
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"This important role should not just be within the purview of MHA or MCI. Therefore, this Bill will establish a Digital and Intelligence Service in the SAF, which will play a crucial and critical role in strengthening our information defence especially in the ever-changing battlefield.",9,493,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00493
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),(In English)  I would like to raise three areas of concern.,10,494,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00494
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, we need to attract the best of talents, but at the same time be selective and protective in the process. In a tight labour market, SAF needs to attract the best talents for our DIS and groom the expertise. To cite an example, in 2015, the Pentagon launched the Defense Digital Service office (DDS). Brett Goldstein, the Director of DDS, described his team of technologists, which come from various public/private-sector backgrounds and which includes engineers, designers and developers, as a ""SWAT team of nerds"" to show the diverse and deep levels of expertise at hand.",11,495,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00495
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"MINDEF has announced that it will establish a Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC) and a Centre of Excellence for Cyber Range (CCR) to stimulate capability development of SAF in the digital and cyber frontier. I humbly propose that SAF can consider specific scholarships in key areas and expertise to attract, groom and train in specialised fields local talents for DIS.",12,496,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00496
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Would SAF consider recruiting from private-sector expertise and if so, will this be on contractual basis? For example, in the US DDS, although scope is not similar, the team is recruited on a two-year limited appointment to focus on a specific mission; after which they return to the private sector or the academia.",13,497,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00497
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, we have to balance this with how SAF protects the sensitivity of information and screening of recruits. To illustrate this, Dickson Yeo was a Singaporean academic who was arrested by US authorities for being an illegal agent of Chinese intelligence. Yeo's former PhD supervisor in LKY School of Public Policy was Chinese US citizen Huang Jing, who was expelled and identified by MHA as an ""agent of influence of a foreign country"". This underscores the importance of screening and protection, especially in the fields of cybersecurity, information and intelligence.",14,498,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00498
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, we need to build capability and cooperation across and within jurisdictions on a whole-of-Government approach. Within Singapore, DIS has to work on this collectively with other Governmental agencies. For instance, in the UK, the National Cyber Force (NCF) is part of the UK Ministry of Defence, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, the Secret Intelligence Service and the Government Communications Headquarters.",15,499,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00499
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Similarly, SAF's new DIS cannot operate in silo and has to integrate into the whole-of-nation approach to combating the growing digital and information threats now and in the future.",16,500,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00500
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, I propose that our DIS officers should have exposure and experience of operations across all SAF services and perhaps, key DIS officers should also have experience and exposure within the various relevant agencies within MHA or MCI.",17,501,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00501
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Across jurisdictions, it is important to have an updated exchange of ideas and innovation in the industry so that the latest of ideas and best-of-class technology can be deployed within DIS.",18,502,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00502
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In this regard, I welcome the announcement that SAF's CCR will host bilateral and multilateral exercises, bringing together ""militaries, industries, and academia"" to facilitate information exchange.",19,503,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00503
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),Digital defence cannot be done on our own. Would there be efforts to formulate a joint comprehensive defence framework for the region? How will such bilateral or multilateral digital defence take shape in the light of certain geopolitical tension or relations? I hope to hear more plans on this from the Minister.,20,504,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00504
2022-08-02-T-011,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My third and last concern is this. We cannot just focus on defence per se, but it is important for us to also build up pre-emptive strike capability. I cite two examples from the UK and the US.",21,505,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00505

2022-08-02-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To meet the short-term ramp-up phase, beyond attempting to attract individual mid-career talents, can we also consider mass career conversion programmes from other industries or even consider upskilling or retraining some of our NSF or NSmen units and redeploying them to DIS, so that we can gather the critical mass required for DIS to be effective quickly?",20,576,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00576
2022-08-02-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Alternatively, we can also consider having a scheme where NSmen who have completed their ORNS cycle continue to volunteer and support DIS. The Work-Learn Schemes where Digital Specialists can earn academic credits from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) that contribute to a degree in Data Science and AI, Computer Science or Computer Engineering is a very good idea for our NSFs. Can we expand that idea to also include opportunities for our higher Nitec graduates to acquire skills and gain academic credits for their future diplomas too?",21,577,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00577
2022-08-02-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"And as we solve the short-term ramp-up needs of DIS and our industries, do we need to readjust the long-term supply of digital and tech talents graduating from our institutes of higher learning (IHLs)? What proportion of the future forecasted demand for these talents will be met by our local IHLs? For instance, should we be looking into increasing our cohort sizes for the digital and tech courses in IHLs to meet the long-term demand?",22,578,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00578

2022-08-02-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Some countries and groups started building up sophisticated capabilities. As early as December 2009, there were reports of coordinated attacks against IT giants like Google, aimed at not just compromising individual systems, but also went after core IP, such as the source codes and proprietary designs. Another example, in August 2012, Saudi Aramco, the world's richest company, had 30,000 of its computers demolished by malware.

And because the Internet respects no boundaries, the rest of the world is at risk. For example, Ukraine was the initial nexus of the NotPetya attack in 2014. The attack started through a software update from an Ukrainian tax filing software company. It quickly jumped onto Ukraine's ministry of health to Chernobyl's radiation monitors, and then to the rest of the world. Within months, analysts conservatively estimate that the cost of the attack to be more than US$10 billion.

It is entirely possible that Singapore could come under constant attacks from nations with strong cyber capabilities that seek to destabilise our media, civic institutions, or even our political system.

The obvious places for our people to spend time with are, of course, IT security companies. But we should not limit ourselves to that. It is an open secret to the security industry that there are certain countries with thriving pools of IT freelancers and experts capable of writing zero-day exploits. These exploits are then sold to cybersecurity firms, or even within the Dark Net. Are we prepared to let our people go to those countries to immerse themselves in those complex environments? I certainly hope so. Because they will allow us to have a pulse of this rapidly evolving field.",25,611,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00611

According to some industry experts, the key challenges that the US government face is the silo effect in achieving a stronger cybersecurity defence. Some commentators felt that NSA, given the nature of its mandate, was viewed as unwilling to share the full expertise and know-how with the Department of Homeland Security, which is in charge of cyber defence. Singapore is too small a country to afford the luxury of turf wars, so I hope we bear that in mind as we have a fourth service.",29,615,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00615

I hope DIS can actively contribute by to our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) by probing our CIIs for vulnerabilities.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The manpower issue for DIS is, indeed, a serious challenge and I think almost all Members alluded to it – Mr Alex Yam, Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Don Wee, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Sharael Taha, Mr Shawn Huang and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. They have highlighted this and given us good suggestions for recruitment and we will study their proposals seriously.",12,655,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00655
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But first things first. Forming a formal fourth service on par with the Army, Navy and Air Force is the best footing for DIS to attract the right type of people it needs.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For soldiers and personnel who join DIS, there will be a dedicated digital vocation which will develop experts in competencies, such as software engineering, app development, data science, AI, cloud architecting, among others. Talents in these fields will be eligible for top-tier SAF scholarships. Compensation, as Members have supported, will be benchmarked against industry norms and regularly reviewed.",15,658,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00658

I met her last week during the presentation ceremony. I joked with her that we have awarded her the scholarship on the assumption – because DIS has not been formed yet, because we have not passed the Bill – that Parliament approves the Bill and that the President assents. I told her, well, if Parliament or the President does not do what we hope they do, we will have to deploy her elsewhere.",16,659,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00659

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Just like other services, and perhaps with even more challenges, DIS must ensure that it provides an attractive proposition for jobseekers. It must provide job security, a good working environment and advancement opportunities.",18,661,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00661
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But as Members here have pointed out, because it serves a higher calling, it must also bring in people with the right values and commitment and the mission mindset.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"This mission mindset was the second key reason for our decision to form a fourth service. In its current configuration, the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) community is a supporting force that supports the overall mission of the SAF and that of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The C4I community will continue to perform these supporting roles for other domains. But with the DIS as a formal service, it is now also directly responsible and accountable to protect the cyber domain against external aggressors.",20,663,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00663
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"As cyber warriors there, they are the frontline troops. This mindset shift is crucial for the SAF as it builds the DIS. I think this was the broader theme which Member Shawn Huang alluded to. As a trained pilot, he knew to ask important strategic and tactical questions about missions for DIS and the key response for effective outcomes, whether for DIS personnel, soldiers, sailors or airmen, is the mission mindset.",21,664,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00664
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, I think the quick answer to Mr Vikram Nair's question – whether it could be a civilian chief – I would say no. You need a military man in a uniform to have a military mindset.",22,665,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00665
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Mr Don Wee and Mr Dennis Tan asked about misinformation warfare and whether foreigners could be part of this force. I think not. Singaporeans must, just like air, land and sea, be the core elements of this fourth service. Obviously, there will be services that they can outsource to third-party contractors. But I agree with them – we have to be very careful even when we do that.",23,666,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00666

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,Mr Alex Yam asked about women – whether they could join as volunteers. Women can join as regulars. I would like more women to join this if they are up to it.,25,668,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00668
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"My broad answer is that certain modules will remain common. Without the right military values and mission mindset, there is a limit in using any individual soldier, no matter how talented he or she is. But if someone serving National Service or a regular, has the aptitude and right attitude, I agree that such an individual can do more in DIS, even if his attributes are not best suited for physical combat.",26,669,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00669
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In fact, we have already started this.

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Our agencies know that they cannot work in silos, lest the cyber attackers exploit gaps or poor coordination. Inter-agency sharing of information, coordination and cooperation already exists.",32,675,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00675
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,Our counter-terrorism efforts have taught us valuable lessons about whole-of-Government (WOG) responses and I cite this because it is a very good parallel example of interagency work.,33,676,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00676
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, similar to cyber threats, MINDEF and SAF are external facing for terrorism, working with foreign agencies to detect terrorists, either individually or their networks that mean to do us harm. MINDEF set up the Counter Terrorism Information Facility (CTIF) to facilitate this work and share that information with external partners and local agencies. MHA addresses the internal threats. For cybersecurity, it will do the same, together with CSA.",34,677,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00677

2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Louis Ng asked if abetment will be an offence that may be compounded. That will depend on the actual offence being abetted. For offences, such as those under the Penal Code, like abetting the assault of a superior officer, which I mentioned in my first speech, the maximum penalty has increased to seven years imprisonment to align with the Penal Code, and is not compoundable.",45,688,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00688
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For the abetment of lesser offences, I think this was mentioned by Mr Dennis Tan as well, MINDEF is open to allowing composition. For example, currently, if a soldier abets another into defaulting on IPPT, say by encouraging him to default or wilfully misleading him with inaccurate information on his IPPT requirements, both would have been charged. With the proposed amendments, both would have committed an offence which may be compounded.",46,689,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00689
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There was a question asked whether compared to summary trials, if compoundable offences, will be on your personal records. The current system is that for all STs, it is on your records. So, it is very interesting with people discharged, we see all the offences, maybe some were even committed 20, 30 years ago for minor infractions. I think it is balance between what we need to maintain military discipline and what the organisation really needs. And over time, I think we have found a new balance.",47,690,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00690
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, Mr Dennis Tan and I think Mr Louis Ng asked which specific offences will be put in the personal record and which ones will not. I will say, broadly, our most common offences are IPPT infractions and smoking in non-designated areas. If Members push very hard, I will try and keep that on the personal record. But I think not. Probably, we will not keep that on. But if you repeatedly miss an IPPT, or purposefully go against the superior's order not to smoke in the area, that is a very different kind of situation.",48,691,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00691
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Louis Ng asked whether it was a discharge and acquittal. It again depends on whether there is a charge against the offence. In all cases referred to an authorised composition officer, no charge is preferred. Once the composition sum is paid, no further proceedings are to be taken against the accused for that alleged offence, as reflected in the proposed section 79A(4) of the SAF Act.",49,692,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00692

We have been doing it for 40-over years under very strict guidelines that protect our catchment area, water especially. Biodiversity – there have been environmental impact assessments done from time to time. We leave it to the agencies. But I want to sound a word of caution  we do not have much terrain to train in. The SAF will take precautions. But if we say, ""Oh, your training can affect"", as Mr Darryl David said, ""one of nine particular fauna or flora"", we may have very limited land to train in. So, please bear that in mind when you are pushing to protect biodiversity – as all of us want to, but there is a balance to be struck.",58,701,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00701
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me conclude. Mdm Deputy Speaker, the substantive change in this Bill is the set-up of a fourth service. The three services of the SAF were established in 1972 with the enactment of the SAF Act. So, 50 years on, the amendments today bring into existence a fourth service. The DIS positions the SAF and Singapore to better deal with cyber threats today and into the future. It provides the SAF with the right structure and emphasis to continue building a full suite of capabilities that can protect Singapore's sovereignty and independence, whether on land, sea, in the air and in the digital domain.",59,702,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00702

2022-08-02-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The Minister said that DIS will compete with other organisations for tech talent. I am concerned that this would further exacerbate the talent crunch in the private sector, especially for SMEs who cannot provide the same salary scales of the Government or MNCs. Besides scholarships, what is MINDEF's plan for increasing the pipeline for tech talent in Singapore to feed into DIS and other organisations. For example, will MINDEF be working with MOE to help our IHLs increase their Singaporean intake for IT-related majors?",2,706,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00706
2022-08-02-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me thank Mr Giam for the reminder. When I said that the formation of the fourth service, the DIS, should compete with the other services, it is not a signal to ""chiong"". They will have a budget to work with. They have to be attractive. But that is the reality. We say that the DIS is important and we say manpower is important. And with the formation of the DIS, it puts it on a somewhat more equal footing, but they will have to compete.",1,707,2022-08-02-T-011-S-00707

2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"And it is not just about having one room. It is about having enough rooms. So many mothers have shared stories about rushing to a lactation room during their lunch break, only to find that another mother is already using it. One mother told me that she would sometimes only have five minutes left for her own lunch after expressing her milk. Feed yourself or feed the child? Madam, no mother in Singapore should have to make this decision.",29,780,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00780
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"It is also clear that buildings with more occupants have higher needs. We should require larger buildings, those with a higher gross floor area, to have more than one lactation room.",30,781,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00781
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"MND has said that the gross floor area threshold is a base guideline meant to strike a balance between needs and the efficient use of space and that some buildings go beyond these requirements. Indeed, as Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad shared when we debated this issue two years ago, MND itself had two lactation rooms in the MND HQ within the floors they occupied, while MOM had five in its two office buildings.",31,782,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00782

2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the UK, the issue of breastfeeding at work is considered a matter of workplace health and safety. Employers there cannot ask a breastfeeding mother to pump in unhygienic environments such as the toilet. We must work towards a similar safety standard for our nursing mothers.",34,785,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00785
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In its next review of the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment, will MND consider lowering the gross floor area threshold, so that more buildings with offices and business parks will be required to have a lactation room? Will MND also consider increasing the number of lactation rooms required for larger buildings containing offices and business parks?",35,786,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00786
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second proposal is that we legislate paid lactation breaks. Expressing milk takes time. On average, a session takes 20 to 30 minutes. But the problem is many women simply do not have time at work to express milk. In the survey, again, conducted by the Breastfeeding Mothers Support Group Singapore, two-thirds of working mothers had this problem. Most of them also said they could not express milk as much as they had wanted during work.",36,787,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00787
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Some mothers try to find time by multi-tasking. But even that comes with its risks. Mdm Yap told me that milk started leaking from her hands-free pump when she was talking to a co-worker.,37,788,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00788
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The risks of not having dedicated time to breastfeed goes beyond some embarrassing spillage. As I stressed earlier, the breasts of nursing mothers become infected and painful when milk is not expressed regularly. Over time, such irregularity also leads to a permanent decrease in milk that the mothers can supply. Mothers are worse off and so are their children.",38,789,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00789
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Laws that guarantee paid breastfeeding breaks are not new or uncommon. A 2020 report on 97 countries found that 73% of the countries had laws for paid breastfeeding breaks. Singapore is in the minority of countries that do not provide this. Why?,39,790,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00790
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I raised this at the recent COS debates and Minister of State Ms Gan Siow Huang replied that the need to build mutual understanding and trust between employers and employees is why Singapore does not take a legislative approach for workplace practices, such as mandatory breastfeeding breaks.",40,791,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00791
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But taking a legislative approach is not mutually exclusive with building trust and encouraging employers. We already legislate a whole slew of protections for our workers. In addition, legislation can spark cultural change. One of the biggest challenges is that many employers simply do not think about breastfeeding at all. Legislating paid lactation breaks can spark a broader conversation about how expressing milk can be normalised and supported at the workplace.",41,792,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00792
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Some might say that flexible work arrangements (FWAs) are becoming more prevalent and that will solve the problem of insufficient breastfeeding time.

It has been reported that work-from-home during the pandemic enabled mothers to breastfeed longer and more comfortably than when they worked in the office.",42,793,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00793
2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But work-from-home is not an option for all mothers.

2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Before I conclude, I want to pre-empt one point. Some may question whether lactation rooms and nursing breaks are a good use of resources. But we should be clear  breastfeeding mothers are a valuable part of our workforce. Already, 20% of women of working age are not in the labour force, as Minister Tan See Leng said at the recent COS debates, I quote  ""There are vacancies across all occupational levels with varied qualifications and needs which could potentially be filled by this group"".",45,796,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00796

2022-08-02-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Businesses can help but the Government can too. Having a more inclusive workplace and providing more support for breastfeeding mothers might make it easier for breastfeeding mothers to re-enter or remain in the workforce. Without a doubt, one of the barriers for many mothers is the lack of time and space to produce milk to feed their children.",48,799,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00799

MHA has clarified that breastfeeding in public is unlikely to constitute offenses of indecent exposure or appearing nude in public. MOT has made clear that breastfeeding is allowed on buses and trains and that the Government will provide nursing rooms at all new bus interchanges and integrated transport hubs, as well as new MRT interchange stations. MOE has said that it is committed to providing a conducive workplace for nursing mothers and will ensure that all Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges/centralised institutes have a dedicated lactation room.

These requirements applied to building types that are visited frequently by families, including public infrastructure, such as transport hubs, and private retail developments, such as shopping malls exceeding 10,000 sqm in gross floor area (GFA).

The latest review that led to the expanded lactation room requirement was carried out by a committee comprising representatives from social service agencies (SSAs), trade associations and chambers (TACs), academia and Government agencies.

For example, the premises of a company that employs more women of child-bearing age will need to have more lactation facilities. On the other hand, it may be impractical for a small building to have a room permanently set aside for lactation due to space constraints. The committee's decision to set one lactation room as the minimum requirement and a GFA threshold of 10,000 sqm for offices and business parks was to strike a balance between the need for such facilities and the buildings' constraints, especially with older and smaller buildings.",9,817,2022-08-02-T-014-S-00817

We will make this subject more pertinent in the training that all security officers undergo before deployment.",3,842,2022-08-02-T-015-S-00842
2022-08-02-T-015,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"MHA would like to commend the industry's public education efforts to reinforce the message that abuse of security officers is not acceptable. For example, the industry associations and the Union of Security Employees (USE) launched the anti-abuse decal last year for display at deployment sites. They have also been very active on social media spreading awareness and underlining why our society must stand firm against abuse and harassment of security officers.",4,843,2022-08-02-T-015-S-00843

2022-08-02-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health whether the Government will consider working with insurers to develop Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) that cover home nursing care and types of outpatient services currently not provided for by IPs in the market, such as rehabilitative services.",1,845,2022-08-02-T-016-S-00845
2022-08-02-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) are private health insurance products on top of MediShield Life. They generally cover large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as kidney dialysis, chemotherapy, long-term parenteral nutrition, and pre- and post-hospitalisation treatments such as consultations, medication, tests and some rehabilitative services.",1,846,2022-08-02-T-016-S-00846
2022-08-02-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for nursing and rehabilitation care, ElderShield or CareShield Life are the national insurance schemes that cover long-term care needs of those who are severely disabled.

Like IPs, these Supplements are also payable by MediSave up to the annual withdrawal limits.",2,847,2022-08-02-T-016-S-00847
2022-08-02-T-017,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the Report of the Auditor-General for FY 2021/22, how will the Ministry structure future tenders under the whole-of-Government Period Contract and Framework Agreement to ensure a good spread of business opportunities for all the vendors in the appointed panel in order to build up players in the creative services industry and encourage vendors to bid for future tenders.",1,848,2022-08-02-T-017-S-00848
2022-08-02-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The whole-of-Government Period Contract and Framework Agreement (PCFA) for Creative Services came into effect in 2018. Its main aim was to streamline the process for public sector agencies to procure creative services and improve value-for-money with better aggregation of demand and economies of scale. Through open tender, potential vendors were evaluated for quality and price. A panel of vendors was then appointed, all but one of them Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Public sector agencies can select any vendor from this panel for their respective projects, depending on which vendor is assessed to best meet their needs.",1,849,2022-08-02-T-017-S-00849
2022-08-02-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Although the PCFA does not guarantee procurement contracts for any vendor, all vendors on this particular panel have been selected for projects of different size and scope. The resulting distribution of contracts, where some vendors obtained higher percentages of expenditure, reflects the independent assessments of public sector agencies on which vendors best met their needs in terms of quality and price. As MOF has noted in the AGO report, this is not a negative outcome. The public sector agencies had provided positive feedback on the ability of these vendors to perform and deliver the required services. MCI did not observe any irregularity.",2,850,2022-08-02-T-017-S-00850
2022-08-02-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The promotion of any industry does not depend solely on Government procurement. This applies to the creative services industry as well. As a result of their appointment to the panel, the PCFA has already enabled more vendors to be given serious consideration by public sector agencies. This helps the vendors build client awareness and strengthen their track record over time. For these reasons, more vendors have sought to be appointed to the PCFA, even if there is no assurance of their eventual selection by any public sector agency.",3,851,2022-08-02-T-017-S-00851
2022-08-02-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To better support industry promotion, MCI encourages agencies to consider using a wider range of vendors, including by actively sharing with the agencies information of all the vendors, such as their portfolios and contacts. To address the challenge that smaller creative agencies tend to have fewer resources to pitch for projects, the PCFA allows users to pay vendors a fee for their pitching services. With appropriate remuneration for their efforts in submitting proposals, smaller creative agencies would be in a better position to pitch for more projects and, thus, improve their chances of being selected.",4,852,2022-08-02-T-017-S-00852
2022-08-02-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MCI will continue to refine the PCFA to better achieve its main aim of improving value-for-money in the Government's procurement of creative services. We will monitor the spread of expenditure as well as increase invitations-to-pitch, and where appropriate, make adjustments to better support industry promotion.",5,853,2022-08-02-T-017-S-00853
2022-08-02-T-018,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether whole-of-Government Period Contracts and Framework Agreements favour large multinational companies that can offer the full set of services in tender requirements at the expense of local small and medium enterprises and independent contractors who may potentially offer a smaller set of the services at more competitive prices.,1,854,2022-08-02-T-018-S-00854
2022-08-02-T-018,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry conducts contractor concentration analysis for whole-of-Government Period Contracts and Framework Agreements called by various Government Procuring Entities; and (b) what is the average share of the top vendor that is within the appointed panel of vendors across all public sector agencies by its procurement value.,1,855,2022-08-02-T-018-S-00855
2022-08-02-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Whole-of-Government (WOG) Period Contracts and Framework Agreements are demand aggregation (DA) contracts that cater for common buys across agencies, by appointing a panel of vendors that agencies can choose to buy from. The aim is to improve the efficiency of the bidding and evaluation process, and enhance value-for-money via DA.",1,856,2022-08-02-T-018-S-00856
2022-08-02-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The number of vendors on the panel of a WOG DA contract depends on the nature of the procurement contract. There are some panels with a single vendor as the vendor can sufficiently cater to agencies' needs for a particular product or service during the contract period, and there are also panels with more than 20 vendors appointed. Regardless of the number of vendors on the panel, all of them would have gone through a competitive tender process before being appointed to be the panel.",2,857,2022-08-02-T-018-S-00857
2022-08-02-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In choosing a vendor from the panel, agencies should award to the vendor that best meets their requirements at a suitable pricing. The share of contracts awarded to each vendor is not a criterion that the agency would consider when it selects its vendor. Hence, it is not meaningful for MOF to set targets for the share of procurement awarded to vendors participating in WOG DA contracts.",3,858,2022-08-02-T-018-S-00858
2022-08-02-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The WOG DA contracts are open to both large companies and SMEs in Singapore. The key consideration for being awarded DA contracts is not the size of the company, but their ability to deliver cost-effective services. Currently, SMEs make up approximately 75% of all vendors on the panels and are awarded more than 85% of the procurements through these contracts.",4,859,2022-08-02-T-018-S-00859
2022-08-02-T-019,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current infant care capacity taken up by enrolled children; and (b) what more can be done to spread the demand for infant care places in popular areas to other areas with capacity to ensure that such demand for infant care places is met.,1,860,2022-08-02-T-019-S-00860

Over the course of 2022, ECDA will develop 1,000 more infant care places in tandem with upcoming HDB developments to cater to the needs of young families. These 1,000 places will be provided mostly by Anchor Operators and exclude places which may be developed by commercial preschool operators.",2,862,2022-08-02-T-019-S-00862

These larger preschools serve a wider catchment of families in the entire town. While families may have to travel further to these centres, enrolled children will benefit from the amenities these larger preschools offer, such as outdoor learning spaces.",3,863,2022-08-02-T-019-S-00863
2022-08-02-T-019,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Even as ECDA makes efforts to increase infant care places, we urge parents to broaden their choice of preschools where possible.

2022-08-02-T-020,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in relation to the Report of the Auditor-General for FY 2021/22 about the price reasonableness of goods and services procured under the Emergency Procurement procedure (a) whether there has been full compliance with the Government Procurement Regulations 2014 that require publication of the notices of award within a 72-day period; (b) if not, what are the reasons for not making such disclosures; and (c) in cases identified to be non-compliant of the Regulations, what remediation steps have or will be undertaken.  The COVID-19 pandemic has been an extraordinary period, where Government agencies and public officers took on new roles and functions in managing the crisis, often in addition to their usual duties.

2022-08-02-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Overall, agencies and public officers adhered to the Emergency Procurement guidelines during the crisis response. However, there were some instances where not all the administrative procedures were complied with. In particular, the publication of award notices for a small percentage of less than 5% of COVID-19 related procurements subjected to the Government Procurement Regulations was not done within the 72-day period. These lapses occurred because the agencies were faced with an unusually large number of procurement awards and were, at that time, very stretched in terms of their manpower resources due to the additional COVID-19 workload.",2,867,2022-08-02-T-020-S-00867

2022-08-02-T-021,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Bicycle-sharing operators are subject to a licensing regime to ensure that their services do not result in public disamenities. They are required to integrate LTA's QR code parking system with their mobile applications and to impose an additional fee of $5 on users who do not park within the designated areas. New bicycle-sharing operators are subjected to a ""sandbox licence"" regime where they are only allowed to operate up to 1,000 bicycles. Users who repeatedly park improperly are also banned from hiring shared bicycles for a period. Since the introduction of these measures in 2019, indiscriminate parking has declined, with more than 90% of shared bicycle users ending their trips at designated parking areas.",1,870,2022-08-02-T-021-S-00870
2022-08-02-T-021,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On 1 July 2022, LTA awarded a sandbox licence to HelloRide to provide a fleet of up to 1,000 bicycles for one year. They were required to submit, as part of their application, plans to devote resources and set up systems to monitor their fleet and remove indiscriminately parked bicycles within a given timeframe. LTA will monitor their operations and assess their track record in managing indiscriminate parking, among other factors, before they are allowed to obtain a full licence.",2,871,2022-08-02-T-021-S-00871
2022-08-02-T-021,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We will also continue to provide more bicycle parking to cater to a growing number of cyclists.

2022-08-02-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In addition, residents will receive payment for reasonable expenses, comprising a removal allowance and stamp, and legal fees for the purchase of a replacement flat. MND does review the removal allowance, taking into account factors, such as the cost of engaging movers, which is typically between $300 and $500 per truck load. To minimise the need for renovations, SERS flat owners can opt for fittings and fixtures to be installed in their new flat under the Optional Component Scheme (OCS). The cost of OCS will be incorporated into the flat price, which can be paid via CPF monies and/or housing loan, thus reducing the cash outlay needed for renovations.

2022-08-02-T-040,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),The debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of the household sector in Singapore averaged at 1.3 for the period of 2018 to 2020. Compared with the top 10 advanced economies by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita,1,970,2022-08-02-T-040-S-00970
2022-08-02-T-040,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"More importantly, DTIs have to be viewed in context of a household's assets. Households in Singapore have assets significantly larger than their debts on aggregate. Looking at assets net of liabilities, the net assets-to-income ratio in Singapore of 7.9 on average for the period of 2018 to 2020 is the highest among the same economies (Table 2).",2,971,2022-08-02-T-040-S-00971

The proportion of non-performing mortgages in overall outstanding mortgages has also remained low and stable at less than 1%. The average loan-to-value ratio for outstanding mortgages extended by financial institutions is less than 50% as at Q1 2022, suggesting that households generally have significant net positive equity in their residential properties.

2022-08-02-T-042,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),(a) The interest rate used to calculate loan repayments under the TDSR is the higher of 3.5% or the prevailing market rate. This rate has built in a buffer against interest rate rises for borrowers who have taken out a mortgage in the past.,4,982,2022-08-02-T-042-S-00982
2022-08-02-T-042,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),(b) Loan-to-value limits and restrictions on loan tenure have also encouraged greater financial prudence among mortgage borrowers.,5,983,2022-08-02-T-042-S-00983
2022-08-02-T-042,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Looking ahead, stress tests by MAS suggest that most households, including borrowers on floating rate packages, should be able to service their debt even under conservative scenarios of significant income losses and a full pass-through of sharp global interest rate hikes.",6,984,2022-08-02-T-042-S-00984

Borrowers who have difficulty servicing their mortgages should approach their lenders early to explore possible loan refinancing and repayment solutions. For financially distressed HDB homeowners, MAS has worked with MND, HDB, MOM and financial institutions to establish standardised interventions when late repayments occur. These include potential loan restructuring solutions, early referrals to appropriate social service agencies and in certain limited cases, helping homeowners obtain alternative HDB accommodation where foreclosures are unavoidable.",7,985,2022-08-02-T-042-S-00985

2022-08-02-T-043,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This issue was addressed during the Second Reading of the Stamp Duties (Amendment) Bill 2022.

2022-08-02-T-045,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Contract variations and star rate items, or items for which rates are not listed in the original contract, are common for construction contracts due to circumstances, such as unexpected site conditions. In a typical construction project, which can span a few years, there can be many contract variations and star rate items. In order to keep to the project schedule, these need to be processed expeditiously. The high volume and time pressure are contributing factors to the lapses observed.",1,993,2022-08-02-T-045-S-00993
2022-08-02-T-045,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The MOF and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) have been continually refining the public sector construction contract management policies and processes. For example, MOF and BCA issued a good practice guide on construction contract management for all agencies in 2019. The guide includes measures on identifying irregularities and fraudulent quotes for star rate items. In 2021, we allowed tenderers to submit a more comprehensive schedule of rates before contract award to reduce the occurrence of star rate items downstream. Where star rate items are still required after the tender is awarded, agencies can adopt a risk-based approach to assess cost reasonableness, such as doing sampling checks. We are also updating the training and capability development programmes for public officers.",2,994,2022-08-02-T-045-S-00994

It would be unwise to compare rental fetched by a private GCB in the last few month with, for example, a B&W bungalow rented out last year or the year before. There are also many factors, other than the timing and state of the market, which affect rental values. One such factor is the state of the property. The B&W bungalows were built in the early 1900s and tenants would often need to invest in the installation of additional fittings, such as air-conditioning, carpentry works and upgrading to facilities such as kitchens and toilets. They will not have the look, facilities and fittings which modern GCBs will have.

2022-08-02-T-077,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To minimise the risk of water leakage, HDB does not allow any drilling or puncturing of the building roof when solar panels are installed on HDB rooftops. Instead, the solar panels are weighed down by concrete ballasts placed on felt pads for additional cushioning. This is a mandatory design requirement for all solar panel installations commissioned by HDB.",1,1148,2022-08-02-T-077-S-01148
