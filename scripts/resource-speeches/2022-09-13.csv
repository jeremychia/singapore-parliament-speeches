2022-09-13-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether vaccinations for COVID-19 will be incorporated into the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule; and (b) if so, whether parents will have a choice between mRNA and non-mRNA vaccines.",1,1,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00001
2022-09-13-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Health with regard to the current COVID-19 Omicron wave (a) whether the hospitalisation rate of 1.9% is expected to rise as more restrictions are removed; (b) what is the highest hospitalisation rate that our public hospitals can currently accommodate; and (c) whether the Government will look into mandating targeted vaccines against the Omicron variant.,1,2,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00002
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I address Question Nos 1 to 2 for oral answer and Question Nos 21 to 23 for written answer on the Order Paper, please?",1,3,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00003
2022-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please do.,1,4,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00004
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,I am very thankful that the number of questions on COVID-19 has decreased significantly.,1,5,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00005
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about COVID-19 hospitalisation rates that our public hospitals can accommodate. As our society becomes more resilient to COVID-19 due to vaccinations as well as safe recovery from infections, we have observed that the incidence of hospitalisation has fallen in the most recent Omicron infection wave, compared to previous waves.",2,6,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00006
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, it is not possible to estimate a hospitalisation incidence rate which our healthcare capacity can handle, because it is also a function of the transmissibility of the variant and the number of people who get infected on a daily basis during a big wave. So, what we need to do is to continue to keep our vaccinations ""up to date"", prevent ourselves from falling severely ill if we are infected, we must exercise social responsibility, such as staying at home and self-testing when not feeling well, and do whatever we can to optimise our hospital capacity. We have been and will continue to re-allocate our healthcare resources on a dynamic basis to where they are needed most.",3,7,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00007
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked about vaccines. We are bringing in bivalent vaccines into Singapore. It is provided for in our agreements with the pharmaceutical companies. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has completed the evaluation of the Moderna bivalent vaccine and a decision will be announced soon. The bivalent vaccines will target both the ancestral strain of COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. Our intention is to update our vaccines for the National Vaccination Programme as the formulations improve. We will share more details when the arrangements are confirmed.,4,8,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00008
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Nevertheless, existing vaccines remain highly protective against severe disease, including for the Omicron BA.5 variant. If you are eligible to receive another vaccine dose, please receive your vaccination without delay and not wait for variant-specific vaccines, as COVID-19 is still spreading in the community.",5,9,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00009
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I will now turn to the Member’s question about COVID-19 in children. As of 29 August 2022, amongst young people under the age of 18 who are infected with COVID-19, the incidence of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was 5.7 per 100,000 for those fully vaccinated, versus 38 per 100,000 amongst those not fully vaccinated.",6,10,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00010
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member also asked about children’s vaccinations for COVID-19, such as whether Novavax will be made available for those aged 18 and below and whether the vaccines have long-term effects on children. Currently, HSA as well as the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) are independently evaluating the Novavax vaccine for young persons aged 12 to 17. Novavax has not submitted the application for its vaccine to be administered to children under 12.",7,11,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00011
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,There is so far no evidence suggesting COVID-19 vaccines result in potential risk of toxicity to humans or developmental defects in children. There are no plans to include COVID-19 vaccinations into the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule at this point as the pandemic situation is dynamic and the recommendations continue to evolve with new data. MOH will review this when appropriate.,8,12,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00012
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked about vaccination-differentiated measures. At the height of an infection wave, measures are taken to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed. However, when cases are lower and steady, many of these measures, including mask-wearing, for example, have been removed. Others, such as vaccinations and vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS), are kept in some form, in anticipation of another infection wave. This is the nature of crisis management – we stand down many measures when they are not needed but we need to keep some, in anticipation of something worse happening later.",9,13,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00013
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"While VDS is mandated for specific settings, such as events with more than 500 participants at any one time, business owners and employers also have the flexibility to implement conditions of service that are relevant to their settings, such as requiring the donning of masks, as well as adopting vaccination-related instructions for customers or for workers.",10,14,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00014
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Nevertheless, as the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) had explained in previous replies, we are reviewing vaccination requirements, from one of counting number of doses and boosters we are taking, to ensuring that our vaccination is ""up to date"". This will be a more enduring posture as we live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease. We expect to complete this review in the next couple of months and will review VDS at the same time.",11,15,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00015
2022-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.,1,16,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00016
2022-09-13-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply. I have two supplementary questions. I note the Minister's response on adding COVID-19 vaccinations into the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule. It will give assurance to parents that the COVID-19 vaccination does play an important role to better protect children against severe complications, such as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children. What else is the Ministry doing to encourage more parents to vaccinate their children for COVID-19?",1,17,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00017
2022-09-13-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"My second supplementary question is when will MOH allow children below the age of five to get the COVID-19 vaccination, since other countries, such as the US, have allowed COVID-19 vaccines for babies aged six months to toddlers aged four years?",2,18,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00018
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the second question first, children under five, we have the supplies; it is part of our supply agreement. HSA has also approved the use of the Moderna vaccine, which is a two-dose vaccine, on children aged six months to under five years old. But because cases are now low and we also want to vaccinate children below five and give the booster for children aged six to 12 years at the same location, it is more convenient for parents to bring siblings often falling into both age groups together to the vaccination centre. But the older age groups, those in Primary schools, many of them are also getting into examination mode and given that the current situation is stable, the cases are relatively low, our intention, as we have announced at the MTF press conference, is to time it around end-October or early November, when examinations are over, so that, with peace of mind, parents can bring their children – those from six months up to 11 years old – either for their primary series or for their booster. That is our current plan. Details will be announced once we are ready.",1,19,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00019
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As we open up vaccinations to all the children for booster or primary vaccination, we want to continue to disclose as much medical information as we can, for example, as the Member has asked, ""What is the MIS-C rate for children who are fully vaccinated and not vaccinated?"" We can tell there is huge difference. Therefore, it is through encouraging parents through transparent information that we hope more parents will bring their children to get vaccinated.",2,20,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00020
2022-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.,1,21,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00021
2022-09-13-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Sir, I understand the desire by the Ministry to allow the private sector to retain maximum flexibility in terms of VDS, but I am wondering if the public sector will move towards a complete removal. I ask, in part, because I believe many of us still have residents that – for religious, health or personal reasons – have chosen not to be vaccinated.",1,22,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00022
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think it is difficult to adopt a blanket policy to say all in the public sector shall not insist on VDS. It all depends on the settings. For each setting, it depends on whether it is crowded, whether seniors are present in those settings, what is the risk of transmission. So, I think we always need to take a differentiated approach.",1,23,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00023
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We must remember that as we increasingly treat COVID-19 as endemic, ""endemic"" does not mean that it is not there. Endemic means to acknowledge that it is there and we have to adjust to our normal life and normal procedures in order to live with the virus. And one of the principles to do so is to make sure that, according to the risk of different settings, we adopt the necessary measures to manage the risks. Therefore, it is in this spirit that we allow employers and building owners to impose their own VDS requirements should they need to.",2,24,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00024
2022-09-13-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Nevertheless, as I mentioned in my main reply, we are reviewing VDS together with the requirements for vaccinations and it should be completed in the next couple of months.",3,25,2022-09-13-T-001-S-00025
2022-09-13-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government will consider commissioning a special review to comprehensively review controls and checks in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic-related procurement and expenditure.,1,26,2022-09-13-T-002-S-00026
2022-09-13-T-002,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mr Speaker, MOF has started its review of the controls and checks in relation to COVID-19 pandemic-related procurement and expenditure since earlier this year. Respective agencies are conducting their audits on COVID-19 pandemic-related procurement and expenditure to ensure transactions are bona fide and that there is no erroneous payment. This is on top of the Auditor-General’s thematic audit of the COVID-19-related procurement and expenditure. The AGO’s findings on HPB, MOM and SLA were published in its report for FY2021/2022.",1,27,2022-09-13-T-002-S-00027

First, to enhance the preparedness for future emergencies, I would like to ask the Minister what are the key measures the Government intends to put in place to minimise financial risks and better manage contracts and payments during emergencies.",1,30,2022-09-13-T-002-S-00030
2022-09-13-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The second supplementary question is, I note that in the Minister's reply just now, MOF has started its review of controls and checks for COVID-19 procurement and expenditure. We are now in FY2022. I wonder if the Minister can give us an update of the actual total COVID-19 expenditure for FY2020 to FY2021, the period that has passed.",2,31,2022-09-13-T-002-S-00031
2022-09-13-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. With respect to the first supplementary question, for COVID-19, the Government had put in place a number of measures to mitigate fraud risks, such as pre-disbursement checks, anti-gaming framework, ex post analytics and post-disbursement audit checks, to identify potential abuse or conflicts of interest. These measures have been effective in managing the risks involved in large-scale crisis operations.",1,32,2022-09-13-T-002-S-00032

2022-09-13-T-002,,,"First, the Government had initially set aside the loan capital in FY2020 in anticipation of a tight credit market.

2022-09-13-T-002,,,"Second, we had some under-utilisation in public health spending. We had set aside resources for public health capacity to cater for potential downside scenarios but did not have to fully utilise these resources. The safe management measures and the cooperation of Singaporeans helped to avert severe public health outcomes. These under-utilisations were offset, however, by additional funding for the various support packages rolled out to support Singaporeans and businesses over the heightened alerts and stabilisation phases from May to November 2021. With these resources, we were able to save lives and livelihoods. Members can refer to MOF's occasional paper titled ""Assessment of the Impact of Key COVID-19 Budget Measures"" which was published in February this year. An interim assessment was also published in February 2021.",3,40,2022-09-13-T-002-S-00040
2022-09-13-T-003,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the estimated timeline for completion of the salary review of early childhood educators under the Early Childhood Development Agency; and (b) whether the review will include implementing measures to manage the workload and provide pathways and progressions for career development.,1,41,2022-09-13-T-003-S-00041

I am pretty sure the last two and a half years have been difficult for them, especially with our children and the COVID-19 situation. Thanks also for sharing a bit on the mental health well-being plans the Ministry has. Could the Minister expand a bit more on the points that he raised earlier on digitalisation and how we can better support them in those terms?",1,48,2022-09-13-T-003-S-00048
2022-09-13-T-003,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"They have also actually shared a bit on some ergonomic issues, for example, because they are sitting on really low seats and the tables are all smaller.

For example, I saw applications that use e-learning that they transfer from book-type of recording into digital devices so that they can be reused again and again. Of course, it is also a very good sustainable effort. So, all these things are being done and will evolve. Actually, I am very happy to see, as I visit some preschools, that we are at the leading edge not only to digitalise for the purpose of education but also to help them with their productivity.",2,51,2022-09-13-T-003-S-00051

Some of the recommendations, as the Member mentioned just now, were to ensure that they have proper seats to sit on. Our teachers are very dedicated and they really connect with our children. They want to sit on the floor and, sometimes, on low stools so that they could connect at eye level with their children. It is not good for their back and their physical well-being in the long term. So, apart from encouraging them to basically take a proper chair or stool when they teach, we have also asked preschools to provide proper desks and seats so that, during their downtime, they can actually sit in an office environment where it is suited for them and not a classroom where there are only low stools and chairs where they continue to do their work.",3,52,2022-09-13-T-003-S-00052

2022-09-13-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But, certainly, there is a relativity among all jobs and all job families that we want to maintain, not just between educators, but also across many other jobs families so that there is balance between what we pay for their skills and contributions and being competitive enough that they do not move across because they are portable across some skills. We lose them. So, this is the balancing that we have to make across them and to compare.

The Journeys Package aims to strengthen the professionalism in SPED as well as recognise the years of experience and service of many SPED educators by placing them at the appropriate competency levels and raising the job size of senior SPED teachers to more closely align with those of equivalent MOE teachers. MOE has been working with SPED schools to put in place progressive HR frameworks to support teacher retention and career development, taking a leaf from MOE’s own frameworks. One example is increasing the number of key personnel positions in SPED schools to provide career advancement opportunities for good-performing SPED teachers.",4,64,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00064
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing:,"To support these efforts, SPED schools will receive additional funding for manpower costs in two tranches  one, which was implemented in 2021, and another planned for 2024. To receive the second funding tranche, SPED schools will need to implement more progressive HR practices and the corresponding increases in SPED teacher salaries. SPED schools will determine the salary adjustments for their teachers at different levels based on performance and current salary structures.",5,65,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00065
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing:,"Beyond funding and working with SSAs to provide competitive remuneration and meaningful career progression for the 1,600 SPED teachers, MOE funds SPED teachers’ pre-service training in the form of the Diploma in Special Education (DISE) offered by the National Institute of Education (NIE). Around seven in 10 SPED teachers have obtained DISE or joined the sector with other recognised teaching credentials. For the remaining 500 teachers, around half are either on the current course or will be enrolled in DISE in January 2023. MOE also funds in-service training for SPED teachers and invites SPED teachers teaching the national curriculum to attend in-service training alongside MOE teachers. In addition, MOE offers Masters Scholarships in Special Education tenable either overseas or locally.",6,66,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00066

This includes seconding experienced MOE educators to serve as SPED school principals and vice principals, upon the SSAs’ request. Currently, there are 14 principals and vice principals who are MOE-secondees out of a total of 47 SPED school leaders. MOE is committed to partner closely the SSAs in this journey towards professionalism.",8,68,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00068

I am very heartened to hear that they are ready to work with the relevant SSAs and organisations. I just have one supplementary question. They are still represented by the Singapore Manual & Mercantile Workers' Union – I understand it maybe because they may have been better adapted to handle this. How has that changed moving forward, so that MOE can better work with the SPED organisations and SPED individuals in this current moment to help retain and attract more SPED teachers to this vocation?",1,77,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00077

I shall not attempt to answer on behalf of NTUC, but as the ex-Secretary-General of NTUC, I will say that I will leave it to NTUC to decide which union best serves the interests of the SPED school teachers. MOE is agnostic, regardless of whether the SPED school teachers are with SMMWU, STU or any of the other teachers' unions.

I just want to ask the Minister to consider that the whole special education model does not comprise only of staff who are known as teachers. Actually, the holistic development of our students over in the SPED system especially, really includes individuals like the allied professionals, psychologists, therapists, occupational therapists (OTs), speech pathologists, social workers and other staff.",1,80,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00080

2022-09-13-T-004,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"I am heartened to hear that there are training schemes and even sponsorships for a Masters programme and so on. But how are we, in terms of meeting the targets that are needed, in terms of the projections of the number of SPED teachers we will need in the coming years and does the Ministry look into what are the current pain points that are preventing people from coming forward, despite all of these very good incentives and training schemes provided?",2,85,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00085
2022-09-13-T-004,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"The other thing is, I am seeing this disconnect, I am a little bit confused – so, I would appreciate the Minister's clarification. I understand that SSAs are coming under MSF, but MOE is now taking a proactive stance in terms of creating the frameworks and training for the SPED teachers. So, is there any kind of operational disconnect for SSAs that they have to navigate, because of this dual Ministry involvement in terms of the development of the sector?",3,86,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00086
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me address the three sets of issues that Ms Carrie Tan asked. First, I think we have to deal with the quantity and quality of manpower; two, we have to deal with the pain points that the Member mentioned; and three, it has to do with the organisational structures that we have to deal with.",1,87,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00087
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the first issue, on the quantity and quality of manpower, certainly, we would need to do much more to increase the number of SPED school educators and support staff. We have laid out the plan together with MSF. We intend to increase the number of SPED schools in our system. But I must share this with the House. In planning for a SPED school, the manpower needs are not as straightforward as a conventional school. Because in a conventional school, the needs are perhaps more homogeneous whereas, in a SPED school, different SPED children have different types of needs and different degrees of severity. This is why the planning is not as straightforward. We do have certain planning ratios, but we, certainly, will need and would like to recruit more Singaporeans to join the SPED sector.",2,88,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00088
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Today, we do rely quite a bit on some foreign manpower and, just like any other parts of our education and care sector, we would like a significant core of Singaporeans to be there, so that we can take care of our own people, especially the vulnerable, even amidst possible disruptions in the manpower supply. So, we will want to step up on this and we do have a roadmap worked out on how we progressively increase the number of SPED school teachers and caregivers as we build up the infrastructure in the next few years.",3,89,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00089
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second issue is about the pain points. For many of us who have SPED children or have been involved in the SPED school sector, we would know that it is emotionally very demanding. It is not easy. So, I have given guidance to my staff that we cannot just plan on the basis of how many staff we need for how many children. We need to have a bit of a buffer, if you would like, for us to be able to roster our people to go for training and also, sometimes, for them to take a break. So, that is one part of how we try to address the pain points.",4,90,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00090
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second part is that we would also like to have a wider group of people who understand the SPED community. Even within the MOE conventional schools, we have our fair share of some special needs children where we would need to ""up"" the skills level of many of our teachers to take care of the higher needs of these children in our conventional schools. That is why we have a system to roster some of our teachers to the SPED schools to cross-share experiences, so that we can take better care of the SPED children in our conventional schools and yet, at the same time, allow some of the SPED school teachers some time to go for their own training and perhaps to be rostered out for a break in their long journey with the SPED sector. So, these are, indeed, some of the things that we need to do.",5,91,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00091
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third point about the structure and organisations, rest assured that the two of us work closely together. We sit side-by-side on many committees. We have this model before and we started this model between MSF and MOE, not just for SPED, but we did this for early childhood education. ECDA is an agency that jointly reports to Minister Masagos and myself.",6,92,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00092
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And, of course, I have a secret weapon, to make sure that nothing falls between the cracks. That is my Permanent Secretary, Wan Yong. She is both the Permanent Secretary in MOE and MSF. And I have personally asked her to oversee the continuum to work out the models required to support our SPED community in terms of infrastructure and manpower. I would say that between infrastructure and manpower, infrastructure is the easier of the two. The more difficult of the two is for us to recruit the number and quality of people.",7,93,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00093
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, we are both working closely now to deal with the most difficult challenge which we want to take a crack at and which we think we need to do much better at as a society. That is the continuum of care from preschool to school and the post-18-year-olds' care and work arrangement for our SPED community.",8,94,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00094
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If anybody can do this well, it must be Singapore, because when the SPED children come to us in the preschools, we have the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC); we have the SPED schools for them. With the data that is available, it enables MOE to forward plan the school system requirement. And from MOE's data, we should be able to forward-plan the post-18 requirement and we really want to do this much better.",9,95,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00095
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our current gap, the biggest gap, in my view, is not so much the preschool and the school system in which we have invested a lot of effort over the years; we can still do better. In our next lap, the biggest gap will be how we provide a continuum from the school system to the post-18 arrangement so that we can better support the SPED community, including the caregivers, who will always be worried about what will happen to their special needs children when they are no longer around.",10,96,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00096

Just a quick question for the Minister in regard to his original reply where he stated that there were 1,600 SPED teachers, if I heard him correctly. Can I just confirm with the Minister whether that number includes the allied educators, who are an integral part of the SPED system? As the Minister also shared, in certain cases where there is a gap, a cognitive gap for certain children, the allied educator could be as, if not more important than the SPED teacher, depending on where the child is developmentally.",1,98,2022-09-13-T-004-S-00098
2022-09-13-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the short answer is no.

A reliable, convenient and affordable public transport system is essential to ensuring connectivity in our densely populated city. It also boosts economic activity, reduces road congestion and emissions and contributes to sustainability and the liveability of our city.",1,102,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00102
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Over the last decade, we have steadily enhanced the public transport system with attendant increases in cost. Commuters have benefited from a 40% expansion of the rail network, 80 new bus services, reduced peak-hour waiting times for basic bus services from 30 to 15 minutes, as well as significant improvements in rail reliability from 67,000 to over one million mean kilometres between failures.",2,103,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00103
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"From 2012 to 2021, operating costs for public transport increased by 7% per year on average. This was not matched by revenue growth. Consequently, Government subsidies have been increasing. The Government, currently, subsidises public transport services by more than $2 billion a year, or about $1 for every journey. In addition, we have committed over $60 billion to expand and renew the rail network over the next decade.",3,104,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00104
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"As with other subsidised services, the Government has to consider how best to share the cost between users and current as well as future generations of taxpayers. There are three key aspects.",4,105,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00105

2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Second, we must find ways to economise and get value-for-money. This requires a comprehensive approach – from efficient procurement by LTA and productivity-focused operations by public transport operators, to optimising the provision of bus and rail services even as we grow the overall network to serve new residential areas. Ultimately, we have to deploy our finite resources in a manner that best serves all Singaporeans.",6,107,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00107

We keep fares lower for concession groups, such as seniors and students, and provide Public Transport Vouchers to low-income families.",1,108,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00108

It is, indeed, money well-spent and value-for-money, I would say. The Minister mentioned about the upcoming fare adjustment formula review and, of course, in every fare review, we wait with bated breath on the outcome. Can I ask the Minister how he sees the fare adjustment formula being improved upon and what can the public expect?",1,111,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00111
2022-09-13-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Also, it would appear that, under the current formula, the balancing item to square up the costs versus the revenue is the fare adjustments.

2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. First, just so that we are all having the same frame of reference, there is a Fare Review Exercise. This is really the annual exercise conducted by the Public Transport Council to decide whether there is a need for an increase of the public transport fares and, if so, by how much, based on the current formula. This should normally come out sometime in the fourth quarter.",1,114,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00114
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Separate to that is the Fare Formula Review. In other words, the formula itself needs to be reconsidered, taking into account the changing commuting patterns, the cost drivers and other factors, so that we can ensure that any fare formula we use in the next cycle is one that is robust and relevant to the circumstances within which our public transport system operates.",2,115,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00115
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, how will it be improved upon? I think, by that, the Member refers to the fare formula. We ought to give the Public Transport Council the time to go through the process and come up with these recommendations. But we can also be quite clear that it is apparent that there are many factors that are at play at this point, not least of which are, for example, commuting patterns, which may have changed – in fact, we already see some changes because of work-from-home and so on – the energy costs, whether that is a pattern that we expect to sustain inflationary pressures and so on. So, we should allow the Public Transport Council the space and time to do a proper job and come back with its considered recommendation. But clearly, the intent is to ensure that whatever formula we use is one that is relevant and applicable, given the circumstances within which we will find ourselves over the next three to five years.",3,116,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00116
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the fare adjustment itself and Government subsidies, well, in some ways, it is arithmetic. There is a cost to providing public transport. There is revenue that comes from the fares that commuters pay. And if the two do not meet, then somebody has to pick up the slack. And the slack, in general, has been picked up through Government subsidies. And as I have said, today, the Government subsidy is of the order of the magnitude of $2 billion a year, about $1 billion each for our train and for our bus services. And we will have to see how the formula works out, what the specific recommendations are going to be and then, we have to take stock from there.",4,117,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00117
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But, the fundamental point – one that I made earlier in my response but which I wish to re-emphasise – is that we do need to strike that balance between on the one hand, having a public transport system that is reliable, efficient, accessible and, at the same time, affordable because the reliability, efficiency and availability of public transport do come at a cost and the costs are increasing. So, we need to decide how that cost burden is to be apportioned, not just between the commuters and taxpayers of this generation but also the taxpayers of future generations because liabilities that we take on today will also be imposed on future generations of taxpayers. So, we have to keep that in mind in making the decision.",5,118,2022-09-13-T-005-S-00118
2022-09-13-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, the Member's question on Public Transport Vouchers to help mitigate the impact, in particular, on vulnerable segments. This is something that we take very seriously. Members may recall that, last year, when the fares were increased, we also announced about 600,000 Public Transport Vouchers would be made available. That is about the third decile in terms of income earners – in other words, up to the 30th percentile of income earners. Or if you include those who have no income, it is up to the 40th percentile or the fourth decile, so, up to 40% of Singapore households would be able to benefit from those Public Transport Vouchers.

Elsewhere, such as in Belgium, employees have the right-to-request for a four-day work week, but with daily work hours extended so that the total number of hours worked per week remains the same. So far, results appear to be mixed. Some of the key concerns that stakeholders have include the impact on productivity, business costs and employee well-being. While productivity improvements have been reported in some cases, this depends on sector and job type. In some instances, reduced work hours have had to be compensated by hiring more labour. At the same time, employees are concerned that their salaries could be reduced due to fewer hours worked, while some could face increased stress when they work more hours than usual in a day to complete their work.",2,122,2022-09-13-T-006-S-00122

We should adopt a flexible mindset.

2022-09-13-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"To better understand the impact of a four-day work week, would the Ministry be open to conducting a small-scale trial among some of its employees or perhaps within segments of the Public Service? This way, we can better understand and study the pros and cons, benefits and challenges. For example, how a reduced work week can possibly better facilitate and encourage employees' continual training and upskilling because setting aside one day a week for training and upskilling can be a win for both workers and the companies. And with better work-life balance, perhaps, a win also for Singapore, with possibly more babies.",2,126,2022-09-13-T-006-S-00126

It is very encouraging to see the recent improvement in these two sectors. Will the Minister of State be able to share more on the depth and quality of the improvements?

The retail and hospitality sectors have shown incredible resilience and grit.

We have tried different manpower and talent attraction initiatives. In order to attract more Singaporeans to the hospitality and retail sectors, we have been encouraging companies to redesign the jobs.

2022-09-13-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just have a supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. As she has mentioned, in 2012, taxis were removed from the COE bidding system and I think, in July 2016, then Transport Minister Mr Khaw Boon Wan shared that, on PHCs, the Government will monitor its rate of growth and uptake of COEs to see if a similar move will be appropriate.",1,179,2022-09-13-T-010-S-00179
2022-09-13-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"If you look at the point-to-point transportation sector today, the number of PHCs are about 70,000 versus about close to 14,000 taxis – about five times more. So, in terms of the relevance of PHCs within this P2P sector, it is now much more than that for taxis. So, I am just wondering if the Senior Minister of State and the Ministry will consider having a similar treatment when it comes to COEs for both PHCs and taxis.",2,180,2022-09-13-T-010-S-00180
2022-09-13-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have explained in my reply earlier, for PHCs, essentially, they have the autonomy and they have the flexibility to decide if they are going to pick up passengers. So, basically, they are like privately-owned cars and if they do take up passengers, it means it helps us supplement the P2P sector in terms of the vehicle population.",1,181,2022-09-13-T-010-S-00181
2022-09-13-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But if you are going to put them like taxis into a separate category, as I have mentioned, first of all, there is an additional difficulty because we will then have to have specific requirements like ensuring that they comply with minimum number of trips and that is actually very difficult to enforce. It will add to compliance cost which will, eventually, trickle down to consumers.",2,182,2022-09-13-T-010-S-00182

2022-09-13-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Essentially, there is a trade-off between having specific categories to meet specific requirements versus ensuring that there is sufficient COE quota for that category. Actually, whether you have a specific category for PHCs or something else, the fact is that it is going to lead to further fragmentation and volatility, particularly when COE supply is low. So, if you are looking at COE premiums and so on, basically, it is, fundamentally, demand-and-supply for vehicles that determines COE premiums.",4,184,2022-09-13-T-010-S-00184
2022-09-13-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have also said, we will continue to monitor the situation. For PHCs, we have been closely watching the market and there is really no evidence that the PHC companies have caused an increase in COE premiums. The population of PHCs is stable and the demand for COEs has also remained stable. And, in fact, the PHC entities have actually not submitted bids or reserved prices which are higher than non-PHC entities.",5,185,2022-09-13-T-010-S-00185

2022-09-13-T-011,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I thank Dr Shahira. Yes, indeed, MOE agrees with what Dr Shahira says. We do encourage all our students to interact meaningfully across different backgrounds and, perhaps, especially across different backgrounds. That is what makes Singapore special – not just in terms of family backgrounds, occupations, where they stay, what race, language or religion they come from.

We will also be establishing a set of Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024 to require employers to consider all requests for FWAs fairly and properly.

2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Firstly, Mr Speaker, Sir, are there specific offences that are given more weight when taken into consideration in approving the licence of debt collectors?",3,279,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00279
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I understand that a range of offences under the Organised Crime Act, Vandalism Act and Protection from Harassment Act would be given more weight against the approval of licence.

2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, there must be clearer and accessible guidelines on what constitutes proper and improper debt collection.

2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Another area of concern is the coverage of communication channels. Does the Bill cover online correspondences, such as email, social media platforms and instant messaging apps?",7,283,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00283
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"These channels have become increasingly common means for debt collectors to badger the debtor, so much so that the US' Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had in 2021 approved a set of rules which dictate how debt collection agencies can email, text or contact debtors on social media to seek repayment of unpaid debts. Among these rules, collectors must allow debtors to opt out of being contacted online. Any messages that they send also have to be private. They are not allowed to post on the debtor's social media pages if it is public or visible to contacts. Are there plans to adopt similar rules here in Singapore?",8,284,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00284
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I also wish to ask how the Bill applies to the guarantors of debtors. I support the move to disallow debt collectors to collect money or attempt to contact persons who are not the direct debtors. However, can the Minister clarify whether this is also extended to guarantors of the debtor? Are guarantors bound by law to repay the debts on behalf of the debtor? Some people may have involuntarily agreed to become guarantors without expecting to be responsible for the loan. This could happen when the guarantor did not have full understanding of the implications or they did it out of friendship or family obligations. Does the Bill deem guarantors to also be debtors? Would the Ministry also consider enhanced penalties for debt collectors who harass family members or other persons?",9,285,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00285
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),Clear guidelines have to be followed through with compliance. Clause 16 of the Bill mentions that the Licensing Officer sets out the code of practice. How will this code of practice be determined and how will compliance be enforced? Should debt collectors be required to wear body cameras? Do they also have to produce their licence to the targeted debtor before embarking on their debt collecting activities?,10,286,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00286
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thirdly, Mr Speaker, Sir, we also want to ensure that the guidelines and regulations are not too restrictive to the point of hampering legitimate debt collection work.",11,287,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00287
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"There is some concern that under the new licensing, with a list of guidelines on what debt collectors cannot do, the pendulum may have swung to the other extreme. In order to reduce the ambiguity of what constitutes improper debt collection, would the code of practice to be introduced via clause 16 of the Bill provide a list of best practices and guidelines with relevant explanatory notes on what debt collectors can or cannot do?",12,288,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00288
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In Australia, the relevant government and public agencies worked on a debt collection guideline for collectors and creditors.

If a debt collector is found to have breached the regulations, what are the avenues for victims to lodge a complaint? Should a specific hotline or body be created to address these complaints? My concern is that the finite resources of the Police may be clogged up by such complaints, which are often less urgent. What action will be taken against the collector? Will they be suspended, pending investigation? How do we avoid situations where a recalcitrant debtor makes frivolous complaints to hamper the debt collector's job and avoid paying their debts? Who will manage and investigate the complaints? Would it be the Police or the Licensing Officer?",14,290,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00290

2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Firstly, we should limit the over incentivising of debt collection companies. I am concerned that some of these companies, especially those that are paid on a commission basis, may resort to hard-handed measures to collect debt, especially if it means that they earn more in return. Will the Ministry consider implementing a cap on the total amount of incentives that a debt collection company can earn from a particular assignment? Are clients of debt collection agencies required to pay a base compensation to these agencies even if the agency fails to achieve the target?",17,293,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00293
2022-09-13-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"More importantly, we should strive to solve the problem upstream by reducing the incidence of overdue debts.

2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Yet, as MHA pointed out, there has been a high number of Police reports made against debt collection companies and debt collectors for conducting debt collection activities in a manner that caused alarm and nuisance to members of the public.",7,308,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00308
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I am thus supportive of the introduction of this Bill to institute regulations to better manage the disamenities arising from such activities and I believe that there is a need to elevate our nation's stance towards debt collection and rehabilitation and hold these companies accountable for the conduct of their debt collectors. With this as a guiding principle, I have three clarifications in relation to the enforcement of this proposed regulation.",8,309,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00309
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Firstly, the Debt Collection Bill has defined the scope of debt collection to mean any activity undertaken in Singapore which ranges from the finding of the debtor, to requesting, demanding or collecting of monies due. Section 45 highlights that the Minister may make regulations for restricting the manner or methods by which a licensee or any of its debt collectors, collect, or attempt to collect, any debt.",9,310,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00310
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"However, I wonder if the Minister can share any guidelines that will result in a debt collection infringing on the intended principles of preventing alarm and nuisance to the public and whether there are clearer regulations prescribing the methods which are deemed unacceptable for debt collection agencies. For example, we would have seen videos showing men in uniform creating a ruckus outside a debtors' home or office. In a September 2021 article by TODAY, a particular debt collection agency even publicly shared that they livestreamed themselves demanding debt repayment and uploaded such videos showing the debtors' faces as so-called evidence to protect themselves.",10,311,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00311
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Where such encounters can be an emotional one, it is all the more important we clearly demarcate the out-of-bounds (OB) markers to better help guide their actions towards a less socially disruptive manner, which then fulfils the objective of this Bill. We should not let demeaning, disruptive and intimidating debt collection tactics take root in our society and our laws need to make clear that such tactics and behaviours are not acceptable.",11,312,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00312
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Second, I note in section 8 of the Bill, in determining whether to grant a licence, the Licensing Officer may have regard to, and give any weight that the Licensing Officer considers appropriate to, any criteria and requirements that are prescribed, but may take into account any other matter or evidence that may be relevant. Similarly, in section 20 of the Bill, there is also significant discretion in determining whether an individual is a ""fit and proper"" person to be deployed as a debt collector.",12,313,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00313
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Will the Minister make clear what are some of the current criteria, requirements and weightage that are under consideration when this Bill is operationalised? It is important that we provide regulatory clarity on this matter and ensure that individuals are not unfairly discriminated against, or perceive to be unfairly discriminated against, when seeking out employment in the debt collection industry, no different from any other regulated industry.",13,314,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00314
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Finally, while I understand that there are public education efforts on indebtedness and borrowing, such as those by MoneySENSE, I wonder if we can intensify efforts to ensure individuals avoid the pitfalls of excessive debt and the dangers of compound interest and excessive hidden fees and charges associated with not servicing one's debt. Even for the well-educated and well-informed, this may not be straightforward. To cite a recent similar but unrelated example, a particular new bank lauds itself for transparency and simplicity and proudly proclaims that there are no cash advance fees for its card. However, there will be an effective interest rate of 26.9% per annum charged from the date of the transaction until the date of full repayment. If left unchecked, these charges could continue to snowball inadvertently.",14,315,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00315
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While the intent of the Bill is to regulate this industry, I cannot help but wonder if this is equally an opportunity for us to explore how the debt collection effort can further evolve to become one that operates on a more holistic philosophy, as opposed to a zero-sum game, where debt collectors win by forcing debtors to cough up monies to pay down their debt. This could be through empowering or even requiring debt collection agencies to provide their debtors with referrals to means of assistance focused on facilitating debt repayment arrangements.",15,316,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00316
2022-09-13-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"For example, Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS) has been a recognised organisation which works with The Association of Banks in helping the debt-distressed individuals manage their debt obligations. However, I understand that credit counselling and the creation of a debt management programme are voluntary and not mandatory programmes. In this case, education on how to manage debt and restructuring one's debt, where possible, can go a long way in preventing occurrences where debtors pay a seemingly infinite number of minimum payments that only service the interest charges.

2022-09-13-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification relates to the qualifications of compliance officers. The new section 4 provides for the appointment of compliance officers. A compliance officer's enforcement powers are significant. For instance, they can enter premises and question individuals, similar to Police officers. Given their significant powers and that they can be as young as 18 years old, it is important that compliance officers are fully ready for their role.",2,320,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00320

2022-09-13-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification relates to the protection of compliance officers. Compliance officers are not public servants. This means that they are not protected by sections of the Penal Code that set out offences for obstructing public servants in discharging their public functions, for omitting to assist a public servant and for threatening injury to a public servant. This lack of protection is despite the fact that compliance officers do exert enforcement powers markedly similar to public servants, as I previously noted. The occupational risks are thus similar.",4,322,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00322

Public awareness will also reduce the chances of unnecessary intimidation and harassment. It may better enable the public to report meritorious cases of errant practices to the Licensing Officer so that proper action can be taken against the debt collection company and/or its staff under Part 4 of the Bill. If there are no public education plans as yet, may I urge the Government to look into an appropriate public education campaign to educate the public?",9,335,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00335

2022-09-13-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Besides the conduct of debt collection activities, this Bill also serves to regulate the operation of debt collection businesses generally and sets up the regulatory framework for debt collection businesses. Having a proper regulatory framework for all debt collection businesses is good as it should help to ensure that the industry and personnel working in it work within a clear regulatory framework. This, in turn, creates certainty and allows regulatory action if businesses or personnel involved fall afoul of the same and we see this in clauses 17 to 18, 22 to 28.",12,338,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00338

2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, my first point is on the powers which the Bill gives to compliance officers who are private actors. To begin with, I note that the Debt Collection Bill grants powers to public officers, who may issue various different codes of practice. Such public officers may then appoint private actors, known as compliance officers, who would enforce and apply these codes of practice when examining the conduct and licensing status of debt collectors.",4,347,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00347
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Such compliance officers are empowered to grant and renew licences to debt collection firms and to conduct investigations on such debt collection companies.

2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, this Bill empowers private actors to act as compliance officers, to take investigatory and enforcement action against debt collectors. Clause 4(1) of the Bill specifically provides that an individual who is appointed as a compliance officer cannot be an employee of a public authority or a public officer. As such, neither the debt collector, nor the compliance officers who oversee them, are public officers with statutory powers, vis-à-vis the public.",6,349,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00349
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Privatisation of this regulatory mechanism may hold potential complications for both the debt collectors and members of the public. Given that debt collectors will have frequent touch points with members of the public, it is of importance that the powers, rights and identities of such debt collectors should be easily understood by the public.",7,350,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00350
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, the public will face significant challenges in verifying whether such debt collectors are legitimate. Furthermore, members of the public may not know the multiple codes of practice that may be proposed which pertain to debt collectors. An example of an existing Code of Practice is the Credit Collection Association of Singapore's Code of Conduct and Practice, and there may also be other new codes of practice which are proposed and implemented under subsidiary legislation by the Licensing Officers under this Bill.",8,351,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00351
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"As such, members of the public may struggle in the following three areas. Firstly, to know whether people who claim to be debt collectors are, indeed, genuinely licensed debt collectors. Secondly, to know when debt collectors have crossed the line when collecting debts. And thirdly, to find avenues of recourse or feedback pertaining to any potential abuses of power by debt collectors.",9,352,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00352
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"It is for this reason that I propose the following. Firstly, that individuals from the debt collection companies should be required to show identification and their licence before they engage in debt collection activities. This would mirror the Bill's proposed requirement for compliance officers to carry ""at all times"" their identification card when examining the compliance of debt collection activities of regulated businesses.",10,353,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00353
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, in line with clause 13 of the Bill, there should be an online directory available to the public to freely search and verify the licence status of a debt collector. This would be consistent with current Government resources, such as the moneylender's directory, which serves to inform the public as to who the licensed moneylenders are, for example. This would bolster and strengthen the legitimacy of the debt collection industry by improving accountability.",11,354,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00354
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, as the Bill allows for the existence of multiple codes of practice which may apply to debt collectors, I propose that the various codes of practice, which may be enacted in legislation and subsidiary legislation, be unified, harmonised and given legal effect. This would ensure certainty and help members of public to have a common, clear understanding of the powers which debt collectors are allowed to exercise.",12,355,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00355
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Furthermore, this ensures transparency and minimises potential abuse of power. Taking the United States as an example, their Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is a federal law that prescribes one singular, unified and legally binding piece of legislation. This legislation draws a clear distinction between legitimate debt collection and harassment or otherwise unlawful behaviour.",13,356,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00356
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fourthly, public education and awareness campaigns should be conducted among members of the public so as to educate them on what constitutes unacceptable debt collection behaviour by debt collectors. Furthermore, in order to deter errant debt collectors, perhaps the Minister could consider a reporting hotline or a platform on a Government-created app, which could be set up to enable members of the public to report errant debt collectors.",14,357,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00357
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This would help to shift some of the burden of enforcement against errant debt collectors away from the compliance officers and licensing officers, and to directly empower members of the public to raise issues regarding errant debt collectors, without overburdening the general Police line.",15,358,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00358
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, my next point is on the need to strike a balance between inclusivity and encouraging robustness in the licensing regime for debt collection. I note that clause 8 of the draft Bill provides that the Licensing Officer can only grant a licence if the Licensing Officer is satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence, and clause 20 provides that the Licensing Officer can only grant approval for an individual to be a debt collector if they are satisfied that that individual is a fit and proper person.",16,359,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00359
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, the concern is that this might prevent existing individual debt collectors who are exemplary in their current work performance, but who have had some past involvement with the criminal justice system in respect of non-violent offences or existing debt collection firms who are managed by individuals with such a background, from obtaining licences under the proposed regime.",17,360,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00360
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For instance, in a CNA article, one debt collection company raised concerns that ""the proposed law would put a lot of us out of business because most of these debt collectors are ex-inmates"" and also because ""both of our directors have a chequered history"". Of course, this does not mean that the granting of licences should be oblivious to a person's past record. But there are different types of past offences and it would seem fair that, for certain types of past offences, after a certain period of time, this should not count against the individual entering this debt collection profession.",18,361,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00361
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Such an approach is consistent with the spirit of unlocking the second prison, and my Parliamentary colleagues, Mr Louis Chua and Mr Dennis Tan, have also made similar arguments.",19,362,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00362
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In terms of determining whether individuals are fit and proper people to be debt collectors, I suggest that companies be allowed to send in testimonials on behalf of their existing employees who might otherwise fail the approval process due to their previous convictions and that adequate resources and a proper process be put in place to hear such appeals.",20,363,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00363
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Furthermore, when considering whether an applicant for a licence is a fit and proper person, I would urge the Government to take into account factors, such as the company's record, years of experience and complaints record, in deciding whether or not to grant the licences.",21,364,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00364
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude my speech by sharing some observations and making some points on wider issues regarding debt.",22,365,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00365
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, I note that, currently, credit counselling services in Singapore are largely administered by private not-for-profit bodies, for example, Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS). CCS facilitates a debt management programme to help suitable borrowers repay their loans in manageable instalments.",23,366,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00366
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, for such debt management programmes provided by not-for-profits, not every borrower is eligible and credit counsellors are not obliged by statute to define, prescribe, apply or enforce any eligibility criteria. I hope the Government can look into how such credit counselling and debt restructuring services can be made more widely available, as well as for the eligibility criteria for various debt repayment schemes or debt management programmes to be expanded.",24,367,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00367
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I also want to suggest that the Government work with not-for-profits and researchers to collect data on the reasons for which individuals experience debt management issues, so that financial literacy programmes, like MoneySENSE, can be focused on addressing precisely those issues and common mistakes. I would also like to call for more attention in financial education programmes to be given on risky retail financial products, such as some kinds of cryptocurrency products, which, anecdotally, have attracted many young retail investors.",25,368,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00368
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, Sir, a 2019 study was reported in The Straits Times, which showed that chronic debt hurts the ability of the poor to make good decisions. A private charity, the Methodist Welfare Services (MWS) developed the MWS Family Development programme, where for every dollar of debt cleared by clients on their own, MWS will match with $2. This programme is targeted at low-income families living on a per capita income of less than $850.",26,369,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00369
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"As another reference point, in the UK, borrowers who are unable to repay their debts are, generally, eligible for Debt Relief Orders if they meet criteria, such as owing less than £30,000, having less than £75 a month in spare income and having less than a certain threshold of assets. In exchange for accepting certain restrictions for one year, these borrowers will be free from their debt after that one year.",27,370,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00370
2022-09-13-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In view of these reference points, would the Government consider launching similar debt reduction programmes for low-income families, with the aim of enabling them to escape the poverty trap, perhaps tied to participation in financial literacy programmes. This could be part of the holistic support provided by the social care sector to the poor, which includes many chronically-indebted persons.",28,371,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00371

2022-09-13-T-013,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I am very happy. Thank you.,1,378,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00378
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Yes, because a number of questions that I originally intended to pose have already been asked, so, I only have two questions to pose to the hon Minister of State.",1,379,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00379
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"First, what would be the approach when staff of debt collection agencies deal with persons who dispute their debts?",2,380,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00380
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"The assumption for a debt collection agency when it is engaged by its client is that there is a genuine debt to be collected. In most instances, it would be a relatively straightforward matter through an acknowledgement by the debtor or as a result of a judgment issued by the Court. There are, however, occasions where the debts are disputed.",3,381,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00381
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"I have come across cases involving people who dispute the debts. For example, they may claim they are victims of impersonation or that the goods and services received are not within the quality expected under the respective contracts. Alternatively, they may not dispute the debts in principle but raise issue with the quantum instead.",4,382,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00382
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"In such situations and in the absence of a Court judgment, can the alleged debtors require the staff of debt collection companies to stop engaging them and refer the case back to the creditors?",5,383,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00383
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"In practice, the debt collection companies usually ignore the protestations of the debtors and continue to insist that the debts should be paid purely on the strength of the instructions of their principals, in this case, their creditors. This may be unfair.",6,384,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00384
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"In my respectful view, there should be clear rules of engagement where there is a potential for debts to be disputed. We may have to weave in requirements, such as the debt collection companies being personally satisfied that the debt collection assignments are genuine, before proceeding with the engagement. What guidance will the Ministry provide to deal with such circumstances?",7,385,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00385
2022-09-13-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Second and finally, I seek clarification on what will be the remit of the debt collection companies under the licensing regime. Will they be limited to collecting unsecured debts against principal debtors or guarantors or is it intended they may also be involved in the recovery of secured debts? Can they, for example, exercise the creditors' rights of repossession of assets that are charged in favour of creditors or subject to hire purchase agreements? If so, what safeguards will be introduced to ensure that such activities are done strictly within the bounds of the law and having regard to debtors' rights?",8,386,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00386
2022-09-13-T-013,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Derrick Goh.,1,387,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00387
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, against the backdrop of debt collection harassment as a cause for concern, this Debt Collection Bill is apt and timely. I would, first, like to commend how MHA has considered debt collection to be a legitimate activity that facilitates the fulfilment of financial obligations.",1,388,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00388
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The proposed regulatory framework, in my opinion, achieves a fair balance between stemming undesirable conduct and avoiding being overly burdensome for the debt collection industry. It is on this premise that I have some comments and clarifications.",2,389,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00389
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Firstly, I welcome the class licensing regime set out in clause 14 of	this Bill, which minimises the regulatory conditions on lower-risk groups. However, the group of businesses under the class licensing regime is a very large category with organisations which vary in terms of their sophistication and debt collection processes. This category includes banks or credit card companies at one end and moneylenders or the smaller outfits on the other.",3,390,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00390
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Given that moneylenders are, generally, less sophisticated, with fewer resources than banks, which are highly regulated, will MHA consider differentiating the class licences, for example, between the institutions that are MAS-regulated versus those that are not, so that licensing conditions are appropriate to the risk profile of the two groups?",4,391,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00391
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Next, as part of the approval regime under clause 20 of this Bill, prospective debt collectors for licensed debt collection companies will have to undergo a fit and proper assessment by the Police. While criminal records are a relevant factor, it is also a vital information for the debarment tenure to be well-calibrated. This is so that it will be consistent with the principle that all ex-offenders deserve a second chance, as championed by Yellow Ribbon Singapore as well as Members in this House.",5,392,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00392
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Referencing the security industry, I have engaged with my residents at the Meet-the People sessions, who were keen to be security officers but were repeatedly rejected by SPF in their application for a licence. One claimed to have had a dated conviction of 15 years ago, has since stayed crime-free and has been proactive in equipping himself with the relevant skills but still was not successful in getting a licence.",6,393,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00393
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Therefore, can the Minister clarify whether ex-offenders who have turned over a new leaf will be given a chance to work as security officers and, specifically to this Bill, as debt collectors in this new regime? If so, can the Minister be clear on the parameters of what turning over a new leaf means, that they can be reconsidered to work in such jobs?",7,394,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00394
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Moving on, in recognising that debt collection is a legitimate activity, I am also cognisant that some debtors can make malicious or frivolous complaints against well-behaved debt collectors to frustrate the debt collection process. However, the truth of each complaint can only be established after investigation, which draws on Police resources and potentially allows the debtor to delay the fulfilment of his or her financial obligations.",8,395,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00395
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister share if there would be further safeguards against such complaints, in addition to levers in the Penal Code relating to the provision of false information, to be fair to debt collection companies or collectors who conduct themselves well? In this case, as the Minister of State has earlier mentioned, complaints against debt collection companies will also be taken into account in the measurement of their behaviour.",9,396,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00396
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Lastly, as communications and collection strategies shift to the digital realm, can the Minister explain if the Bill will regulate undesirable debt collection activities conducted on online platforms, such as through messaging or social media? What are other levers available to counter online harassment by debt collectors to ensure that such digital means will not be exploited as a regulatory gap for harassment of debtors?",10,397,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00397
2022-09-13-T-013,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Sir, in conclusion, I believe the regulatory framework introduced by this Bill will better address the law and order concerns, protect the general public as well as to professionalise the debt collection industry in the long run.

2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"As the Ministry has stated, debt collection is a legitimate activity and the borrower has legal obligations to meet the terms of the loan repayment.

2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"On the other hand, there are valid complaints, such as against increasingly strange, or some might say, creative methods used by the debt collectors. They are invariably unpleasant, often disturbing and, sometimes, outright alarming.",4,403,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00403
2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Some collectors do harass their targets and those around them, such as family members, neighbours and co-workers, in attempts to get the attention of the borrowers and pressurise them to pay up. We need to put a stop to these wrongful practices. Hence, I welcome the proposed legislation to set up a licensing regime and specify what the acceptable debt collection methods will be.",5,404,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00404
2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I would also like to take this opportunity to request that MHA look into the moneylending activities involving foreign workers, including migrant domestic workers.

2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the new Bill to regulate debt collection activities in our country through a licensing system which empowers the Police to stop inappropriate debt collection practices. Some debtors, unable or unwilling to repay the borrowed money, refuse to contact their lenders. They should discuss and negotiate to reschedule their debt repayments.",7,406,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00406
2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"In order to recover the money, the debt collectors use all kinds of methods to collect the money. But some collectors go overboard and take extreme measures, harassing the borrowers' families, neighbours, colleagues and so on, or cause members of the public to panic, which is unacceptable to us.",8,407,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00407
2022-09-13-T-013,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Recently, I heard that some lenders, after learning that some people are facing financial difficulties, obtain their bank account numbers and directly remitted sums of money to them and then try to collect the debts and charge very high interest. I would like to ask whether the authorities have investigated such cases. Is this a serious problem? And is there a rising trend?",9,408,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00408

2022-09-13-T-013,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of my work as a Member of Parliament, I have experienced first-hand the devastating impact of debt collection harassment on residents, their families and their neighbours. Affected parties live in constant fear that the debt collectors may harm them and/or their loved ones. Some dread returning home or even picking up the phone for fear that the debt collector is after them. The stress and anxiety arising from debt collection activities have caused some of my residents to contemplate suicide.",1,411,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00411
2022-09-13-T-013,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"There were cases where the outstanding debt owed is grossly overstated, with no basis.

2022-09-13-T-013,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"So, Sir, the Debt Collection Bill is, therefore, timely to improve visibility and oversight of the debt collection industry and deter problematic debt-collecting behaviour.

2022-09-13-T-013,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"As part of the licensing programme, debt collectors should be required to pass a test on their understanding of the debt collection rules and regulations before being granted the licence.

2022-09-13-T-013,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, some countries have put in place schemes to give debtors in problem debt the right to legal protections from their creditors.

2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Murali Pillai asked if the Bill will regulate the collection of both secured and unsecured debts. The Bill defines debt as a monetary obligation owed by a debtor; the collection of such debts, whether secured or unsecured, will be regulated. However, the collection of non-monetary assets, including those used to secure a debt, will not be regulated for now, as such activities have been assessed to pose minimal law and order risk. Nevertheless, the Police can still rely on existing legislation like the Penal Code or Protection from Harassment Act to take errant collectors of non-monetary assets to task.",2,425,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00425
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Chua, Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Derrick Goh, Mr Louis Ng, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the criteria used by the Licensing Officer to assess whether an applicant is fit and proper to be granted a licence to operate a debt collection business or approval to be deployed as a debt collector.",3,426,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00426
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"As mentioned in my opening speech, the Licensing Officer will consider factors deemed relevant in assessing the applicant's propensity to engage in problematic debt collection conduct, such as past offences involving harassment or violence, as listed in the Second Schedule of the Bill. The Licensing Officer will also consider the severity of the offences and the length of time that has passed since the commission of the offence. The considerations used to assess whether an individual is fit and proper to work as a debt collector are similar to those used for security officers. The approval to be deployed as a debt collector is not time-limited. However, the approval may be revoked or suspended should the Licensing Officer assess that the debt collector no longer meets the fit-and-proper criteria.",4,427,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00427
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,We appreciate Mr Leon Perera's suggestion to provide opportunities for ex-offenders who may wish to join the industry. The Licensing Officer will consider their circumstances on a case-by-case basis.,5,428,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00428
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Derrick Goh asked if there will be differentiation among the class licensees, based on their respective risk profiles. Given that class licensees are already regulated by other Government entities, they are assessed to pose lower law and order risk, compared to debt collection businesses that are not currently regulated. As such, we assess that there is no need to further differentiate the class licences for now. Nevertheless, we will monitor the situation and recalibrate the class licensing framework if the need arises.",6,429,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00429

2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"During my opening speech, I mentioned that we will be introducing regulations to guide the conduct of debt collection businesses and their debt collectors. For example, debt collectors will be required to verify that the subject of the debt collection from whom they are attempting to collect a debt, indeed owes the debt, such as verifying the subject's identity against the signatory to a debt contract.",8,431,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00431
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,The Debt Collection Regulations will also prohibit debt collectors from continuing to collect debt from a debtor if the debtor has informed the debt collection business or collector that the debt is in dispute or that the debtor has initiated a process to settle the debt through other means. The acceptable process for this will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation. This could include mediation or Court proceedings.,9,432,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00432
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Debt collectors will also be required to ensure that there is a proper contract detailing the terms of appointment by the creditor, the debt to be recovered, the payment schedule and the debtor's identity.

2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I will also add that for instances of debt collectors collecting debts from victims whose identities have been misused by impersonators to borrow money, cheating by personation is punishable under section 419 of the Penal Code. If such cases are reported, the Police will investigate the matter. However, the Police do not investigate civil disputes about the debt.",11,434,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00434

As mentioned in my opening speech, we will introduce the regulations prohibiting any behaviour that threatens the physical safety of the debtor or any other third parties, such as the debtor's family members. This includes sending text or social media messages to the debtor, threatening physical harm to the debtor or his or her family. Livestreaming of debt collection activities, in and of itself, is not an offence unless it crosses the threshold for other criminal offences, such as the Protection from Harassment Act.",12,435,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00435

2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"To address Mr Leon Perera and Mr Yip Hon Weng's question about how debtors may verify the legitimacy of debt collectors, we will require debt collectors to show proof of the Licensing Officer's approval, when asked to do so.",16,439,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00439
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the potential avenues for members of the public to lodge complaints against errant debt collection activities. Members of the public may lodge a Police report online via the i-Witness Portal or Police’s e-services website.

If immediate Police assistance is required, they should contact the Police at ""999"".",17,440,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00440

2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Derrick Goh and Mr Yip Hon Weng have voiced their concerns over debtors who make malicious or frivolous complaints against debt collectors to frustrate the debt collection process and asked if there will be safeguards against these debtors. As the Member rightly pointed out, furnishing false information to cause Police to act against debt collectors is punishable under section 182 of the Penal Code. Police will investigate and take action against the debtor if an offence is disclosed.",19,442,2022-09-13-T-013-S-00442
2022-09-13-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"There are also safeguards within the Bill to avoid penalising innocent debt collection businesses and debt collectors.

For example, whether there will be guidelines to help residents not fall prey to scams, whether the community legal clinics are sufficient for residents to seek legal advice, whether there will be measures to protect vulnerable segments of the population from excessive borrowing and making debt counselling and restructuring more widely available, as well as whether we can consider introducing a scheme for debtors to seek temporary relief from debt collection activities, similar to the Debt Respite Scheme in the UK.

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To allow for greater flexibility in future, regulations under the Bill can enable a prescribed person, such as the Minister, to permit the use of a national symbol in appropriate situations. This could entail, for example, permitting the display of the national flag outside the National Day period, if warranted by circumstances.",26,491,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00491
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We also intend to make regulations to enable a prescribed person to prohibit certain uses of the symbols, subject to appeal. This is to prevent disrespectful uses of the symbols. With these new regulations, we can respond more nimbly to legitimate requests to use the national symbols under pre-specified conditions, while also protecting the national symbols from indiscriminate or inappropriate use.",27,492,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00492
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To provide greater flexibility in the use of the national symbols, we will also review the circumstances and manner in which the symbols may be used. For instance, we envisage that the new regulations could take a more permissive stance to allow greater artistic and creative use of an image of the Singapore flag; and to permit the use of images of the national flag on attire outside the National Day period without requiring approval, provided that such use is non-commercial and such use is respectful.",28,493,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00493
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Nonetheless, we must balance the introduction of greater flexibility with proper safeguards against the misuse of our national symbols. As Mr S Rajaratnam had pointed out, we need to respect the national symbols for the values, sentiments and ideals they represent. Rules are critical to ensure that the symbols are not wilfully brought into contempt, ridicule or hatred because such disrespect for our symbols will be an affront to the people of Singapore and the values they represent.",29,494,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00494
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"During the public consultation, many Singaporeans underlined the importance of ensuring that the dignity of the national symbols is upheld even as more flexible use is allowed. Hence, the third major change we will be making in the Bill is to update the penalties for offences relating to the national symbols and Presidential symbols.",30,495,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00495
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The current penalty for offences under the SAFNA Act is a fine of up to $1,000 – a maximum fine of $1,000. This sum will not be as effective to serve as a deterrent today as the amount was set in 1959 and has not been updated since. Taking into account the maximum penalties that are set for similar offences, we will update the penalties for such offences to a maximum fine of $30,000 or a maximum imprisonment term of six months or both.",31,496,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00496
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,The penalties for individual offences will be calibrated in the new regulations. More egregious offences would attract higher penalties. An example is the burning or desecration of the national flag.,32,497,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00497
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Sir, the national symbols represent the nation and the Head of State. Respect for the symbols is part of the civic and public morality of the nation. Any affront to our national sovereignty and pride as represented by our symbols must be dealt with seriously. We should not allow the symbols to be wilfully brought into contempt, ridicule or hatred. Furthermore, their unauthorised use by private individuals or entities can create false or misleading impressions of links to, or endorsement by, the President or the state. Such uses could lead to public order issues. There is, therefore, a need to regulate the use of the symbols to uphold public morality and order.",33,498,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00498
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Finally, any prosecution under the Bill may only be instituted by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor. This ensures that prosecutions under the Act are brought in the public interest.",34,499,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00499
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The Bill will also make the following amendments to related legislation – section 59(1)(f) of the Evidence Act 1893 will be amended to require the Courts to recognise the public seal and the Presidential seal. The National Emblems (Control of Display) Act 1949 will be renamed the ""Foreign National Emblems (Control of Display) Act 1949"" to make clear that its role is in regulating foreign national emblems.",35,500,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00500
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Sir, this Bill reflects what our citizens have expressed in our engagements and public consultations over the past few years.

2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"National symbols are an important part of our national identity and a common rallying point for Singaporeans. I welcome this Bill, which recognises and protects these symbols. I thank MCCY for allowing Singaporeans to be a part of the process in deciding what our national symbols mean to us by convening a citizens' workgroup and public consultation for this Bill. I have three suggestions and clarifications on the Bill.",2,505,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00505
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is on pre-approval requirements. I am glad that MCCY listened to feedback from the citizens' workgroup and is allowing a wider use of our national symbols by loosening approval requirements. This gives Singaporeans more freedom to express their identity and love for Singapore.,3,506,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00506
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, there are still some situations where the Government's pre-approval is needed. This includes the commercial use of our symbols outside of the National Day period or for using the National Anthem.",4,507,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00507
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister share how the Ministry will ensure that the pre-approval process is accessible, low-cost and simple to navigate for well-intentioned individuals who wish to use the national symbols?",5,508,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00508
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Independent creatives, in particular, may not have the administrative knowhow to navigate the process. We should ensure that the bureaucracy of it all does not deter them from innovative, respectful uses of our national symbols.",6,509,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00509
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification relates to the prohibitions under the regulations. Will the Minister consider creating enhanced punishments for those who misuse the national symbols to mislead others? Our national symbols are not only a source of identity. They also carry the Singapore brand, signifying the trust and reliability we are known for. Almost every day, we are seeing new attempts to scam Singaporeans or spread false information, with a large variety of creative tactics. Earlier this year, investment scammers tried to pass off as GIC and used its logo to try and trick Singaporeans into transferring money to them. I can easily imagine that other scammers might try to use our national symbols, to fake official Government communications, or give a sense of reliability and trick victims into letting their guard down. Enhanced penalties will deter such fraudulent behaviour and help protect Singaporeans from harm.",7,510,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00510
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My last clarification relates to the President's powers to amend the symbols. Section 13 allows the aspect or description of any symbol to be amended by notification in the gazette. Amendment by notification in the Gazette which does not require approval of Parliament appears to be incongruent with the sacrosanct nature of the symbols.,8,511,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00511
2022-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister clarify in what circumstances is it anticipated that such an amendment may be made? Will public consultation be sought before any amendments? When the President exercises her or his powers to amend the symbols, on what basis and on which entity's or individual's advice will the President be acting? Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",9,512,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00512

2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, I support the Bill in making meaningful and necessary changes. I shall focus my speech on the posture which I hope all stakeholders will take towards this law, not only in Government, but also those in political parties, civil society groups and citizens at large. And that posture should be to use this law as a reference point for the work of galvanising awareness and respect for our nationhood amongst all citizens. All of us can and should be ambassadors and role models for this work, in ways both large and small.",2,515,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00515
2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, this Bill is about national symbols. When people speak of something as symbolic, it sometimes means that it is less valuable and less important. Less important, perhaps, than material things – money, resources, healthcare, the proverbial bread-and-butter issues. The bread-and-butter issues that, in some narratives, Singaporean public life is fixated on.",3,516,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00516

Because they symbolise our hard-fought Independence and our national sovereignty. And why is our national sovereignty important?

2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, it is my hope that our schools and other institutions educate the public about the meaning of our national symbols with this in mind. That these symbols are about our freedom. For example, it is said that Pak Zubir Said, when he composed the national anthem, thought of it as a kind of prayer to be uttered when Singapore attained Independence. And here, I would like to call for more efforts to be made to educate our people on the meaning of the national anthem. It is sad that many citizens do not know the words or even what the words mean, simply referring to our anthem as ""mari-kita.""",6,519,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00519

2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, in my conversations with Singaporeans as a Member of Parliament and previously as a Workers' Party volunteer and, before that, a civil society activist, I have come across the view that displays of national symbols are associated with support for the ruling party, the ""establishment"", the ""status quo"", however you want to deﬁne it. It is a view that has some currency, though much less today than it did in the past, from what I can tell.",8,521,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00521
2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In truth, I encounter this view less and less. And I can quite conﬁdently say, from many conversations with Singaporeans, that displaying the ﬂag is not associated with any particular political leaning.

2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In fact, many of the people who are disinterested in the symbols of the nation for such reasons do so precisely because they care passionately about certain principles, ideals and values.

2022-09-13-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"While we may disagree and debate robustly over what the ideals of our pledge concretely mean in day-to-day policies, we should strive to nurture this hope in our hearts and the hearts of fellow Singaporeans.",43,556,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00556

2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, this Bill is a welcome move. Many Singaporeans when travelling abroad would have seen how national flags are quite freely used on apparel and luggage bags. Hence, some of them would question why other countries can be liberal with the use of national symbols whilst what is permitted in other countries may not be allowed in Singapore.",1,558,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00558
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As such, I welcome the overarching objectives of clause 14 of the Bill, which allows the President to create such regulations relating to our national symbols as the President deems fit. However, I have some clarifications on the Bill and the proposed regulations.",2,559,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00559
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Firstly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, there should be more clarity on the use and design guidelines for national symbols. I believe this will be met with the flexibility of making the regulations pursuant to the Bill.",3,560,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00560
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"One problematic area is that of commercial advertisements. There were instances in the past where the lion head symbol was used to promote products and services which had no relation with the Government. Often, the symbol was used for innocuous purposes, such as to highlight that the product was made in Singapore. However, such usage may have created the misimpression that the products and services had some form of official endorsement.",4,561,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00561
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Under the current circumstances, what if the users were to use part of the symbol or, for example, to use the symbol in different colours as they try to circumvent the rules?",5,562,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00562
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"We also need more comprehensive guidelines for the use of the flag's image without requiring official approval on attire, decoration and products. Without clear guidelines, businesses may misuse our national symbols to give the impression that the product or service is authorised by the Government. For example, if security guards who do not work for Government services or public agencies have been spotted with the flag emblem on their uniforms, would that or should that be an offence?",6,563,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00563
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),It is pertinent to reduce ambiguity. This is to ensure that the rules can be properly endorsed but without the need to constantly consult the relevant bodies or burden them with onerous approval processes.,7,564,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00564
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Secondly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, how specific will the proposed regulations be with regard to the use of national symbols? Also, as equally important, how will penalties be enforced? The interpretation of designs can be highly contentious. Something that is considered disrespectful to someone may be interpreted in an entirely different manner by another. Will there be a framework to provide guidance to our designers? Does the Government intend to get experts to provide views on its assessment? If a notice is served on an offender, what is the timeline given to remove the offending act before enforcement action is taken?",8,565,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00565
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"How many cases were prosecuted under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (SAFNA) Act and Rules for such offences in the past? Related to this, should there be a need to define ""use"" and what offences can carry a prosecution? Is the Bill also intended to cover the use of the national symbols in documents, for example?",9,566,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00566
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thirdly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I wish to share some concerns specifically with regard to our national flag. A question I would like to raise is whether social groups are allowed to use the national flag and other national emblems in their activities. While this could ostensibly be perceived as a patriotic gesture, it could, in fact, be an attempt to gain wider public support for their activity and their causes. These groups may be locally registered as a society or as a Singapore chapter of a global organisation. They could also be simply a group with a common cause.",10,567,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00567
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Next, there are buildings where you have several flag poles lined up in a row. May I ask the Minister when our national flag is flown on the flag pole, can a social group fly its flag at the next flag pole alongside our national flag? I raise this because it could mislead the public by giving the impression that the Government stands alongside a social group and its beliefs.",11,568,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00568
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Flag desecration is a serious offence. We have read of instances where people have burnt decorations put up for National Day and arrests have been made by the Police. Last year, a 24-year-old man was charged with cutting and damaging multiple National Day Parade banners and, most recently, a 39-year-old man set a flag on fire and he was arrested.",12,569,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00569
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"May I ask whether it is an offence for the image of our flag and national emblems to be put on paraphernalia which are used for offerings for religious activities, say, during the Hungry Ghost Festival or any other festivals? A person can also use this as an anti-Government gesture under the pretext of practising his or her religious belief.",13,570,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00570
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Lastly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, Singapore is a young nation. As we journey along, there may be new symbols being introduced. Does the new legislation cover the addition of new symbols? How will the National Emblems (Control of Display) Act 1949 be amended?",14,571,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00571
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, our national flag and emblems are more than just visual representations. Our national flag, especially, represents the values and ideals that we hold dear. When we were children, we were taught to stand and put our hands over our hearts, facing our national flag and say the national pledge in school. We stood to sing the national anthem. Our children, including my children, continue this practice today.",15,572,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00572
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Respect for our national symbols is consistent across economic, racial and religious grounds. Our national symbols are emblems of our unity, thoughts and purpose as a nation. These symbols are not mere pieces of decoration nor objects to be honoured for themselves. They are honoured for what they represent. The use of our national flag and symbols thus offer opportunities for Singaporeans to express our patriotism and such patriotism is more important now than ever before.",16,573,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00573
2022-09-13-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"After 57 years, we are at a crossroads in our nation's journey.

2022-09-13-T-014,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"I would like to share a personal story 22 years ago when I was an athlete. In 2000, I represented Singapore at the FINA World Cup in Australia. I swam well enough to make the finals, just two lanes away from the world record holder. When I watched the replay on TV that night, I was disappointed to see that next to my name where the Singapore flag should have been was a grey box. For reasons I do not know, the TV production crew did not have the graphic of the Singapore flag. I felt very sad at that instance. Sad because I felt, in a way, deprived of the ability to share my glory with Singapore. So, to me, this underscores the significance of our national flag and our national symbols.",5,581,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00581

2022-09-13-T-014,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"On the matter of wearing the national flag on the team kits, I would like to ask two questions. One, what is the process for National Sports Associations (NSAs) and other organisations to seek approval for the national flag or symbols to be on the team uniform? Two, are there guidelines for the type of national teams that can have the national flag or symbols on the uniform? For example, can a youth team wear the national flag on the kit?",7,583,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00583

2022-09-13-T-014,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Again, I understand that one cannot have detailed prescriptions for everything, but it would be good if the Government could provide some clear guidance in this area.",17,613,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00613
2022-09-13-T-014,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, our national symbols are quintessential to the Singapore identity. Many Singaporeans, and even foreigners, have come to associate the national symbols as synonymous with Singapore and the Singapore brand and what Singapore stands for. The national symbols are also cultural symbols, each capturing a unique portion of Singapore's history and the aspirations of our country and people.",18,614,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00614
2022-09-13-T-014,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Singaporeans should thus be more acquainted with the history of the symbols and what those symbols stand for. One of the approaches to increasing Singaporeans' awareness of the symbols is to allow them to come into contact with these symbols more freely and more spontaneously in their everyday lives and to conduct more public education on what the symbols mean. Safeguards, of course, notwithstanding, I end my speech in firm support of the Bill.",19,615,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00615

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The national symbols belong to Singapore and all Singaporeans. They represent our state and people. They embody our most cherished ideals, values and aspirations. They are a manifestation of our shared identity. As our founding Prime Minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew believed, the symbols have and I quote, ""every reason to endure as the emblems of the state"" and ""will evoke loyalty and unity in our people"".",2,618,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00618

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Let me first address the points raised by Mr Louis Ng regarding clause 13 of the Bill, which seeks to empower the President to amend any aspect or description of a symbol, by Proclamation in the gazette. Mr Louis Ng observed that the Bill allows the aspect or description of any symbol to be, and I quote, ""amended by notification in the gazette without requiring the approval of Parliament"" and ""appears to be incongruent with the sacrosanct nature of the symbols."" He wishes to know the circumstances in which such amendments may be made and if the public would be consulted before any such amendments.",7,623,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00623
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I would like to state that we do not envisage amending or altering the symbols in any significant way. As Mr Louis Ng pointed out, the national symbols and their official meanings are well-established and widely recognised by Singaporeans. Clause 13 of the Bill will likely only be used to make minor and technical updates when needed, for example, the enhancement of the digital file quality of the official images of the symbols. We do not envisage this clause to be used frequently or in any significant way.",8,624,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00624
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Under the SAFNA Act, the description of the national anthem, state crest and national flag are all already set out in the subsidiary legislation. In exercising the power of amendment under clause 13, the President will be acting on the advice of the Cabinet. In the event that any significant amendment to a symbol is being considered in accordance with the wishes of the people of Singapore, we will take the public's views into consideration and, if significant changes are needed, Parliament will be consulted.",9,625,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00625
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Yip Hon Weng raised a related point, namely, whether the legislation would cover the addition and inclusion of newer symbols. I wish to clarify that Parliament will need to amend the Bill to add a new national symbol.",10,626,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00626
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For now, we do not foresee the need or wish to add any new national symbols.

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,Let me now address the questions related to giving Singaporeans greater flexibility to use the national symbols to express their national pride.,14,630,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00630
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Darryl David asked if we could consider extending or even abolishing the fixed period when the flag could be flown. I would like to share with him that in our public consultations held over 24 months, greater flexibility was very much welcomed. However, those we engaged also consistently raised the concern that over-liberalisation would diminish the stature of the symbols and lead to more incidences of misuse. Some of the respondents and participants also highlighted that hanging the flag, when the National Day period – July, August, September – comes around every year, is a form of national ritual that affirms our patriotism and love for Singapore, not unlike the daily pledge-taking or singing of the national anthem in schools.",15,631,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00631
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We have, therefore, taken a calibrated approach towards liberalising the use of the national symbols by trying to lower the barriers to the most common uses, whilst putting in checks and balances, safeguards to protect the dignity and stature of our national symbols.",16,632,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00632
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Louis Ng, Mr Mark Chay, Mr Darryl David and Mr Yip Hong Weng asked about the guidelines on the use of the national symbols and the process by which permission for their use can be sought.",17,633,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00633
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Louis Ng highlighted the need for the approval process to be ""accessible, low-cost, and simple"" enough for well-intentioned individuals, such as independent creatives.",18,634,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00634
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"On a related note, Mr Mark Chay asked about the approval process for NSAs to use the national flag or other symbols on their sporting attire and whether there are guidelines under which national teams can use the flag or other symbols on their uniforms.",19,635,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00635
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Darryl David, in his speech, also asked about the approval process for using the lion head symbol on product packaging and suggested that the guidelines be explicitly communicated to prevent the public and merchants from contravening the use of those symbols.",20,636,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00636
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Similarly, during his speech, Mr Yip Hon Weng asked for more clarity on the usage and design guidelines for the national symbols, including (a) their uses in commercial advertisements; (b) how detailed the proposed regulations will be; (c) clearer examples on how the image of the national flag could be used on attire, decoration and products in cases where no official approval is required; and (d) if a guiding framework will be developed to help designers navigate this process.",21,637,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00637
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Madam, I thank the Members for highlighting all these important considerations because the symbols belong to our people. We wish for fellow Singaporeans to have more opportunities to display and celebrate their national pride. As we allow for more flexibility in the use of the symbols, we will also ensure that the guidelines on their usage are easily accessible and easily understood, especially for cases where no prior approvals will be needed.",22,638,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00638
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Presently, we have in place a simple process for anyone wishing to seek approval for the use of a national symbol. Depending on the context of the nature of use, this process will continue after the Bill comes into effect. This process will also remain free for users.",23,639,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00639
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"As pointed out by Mr Mark Chay, there are specific administrative processes required to use the national symbols in some cases, like in the instance of the attire for Team Singapore athletes. This is to ensure the accurate and dignified representation of our country outside Singapore by our sporting ambassadors.",24,640,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00640
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For example, currently, approvals for use of the image of the flag on the team attire for national athletes are channelled through Sport Singapore, the public body providing recognition and support for NSAs. Approvals for other organisations that wish to use the national flag on their attire, including youth teams that may not belong to any NSA, is granted through MCCY on a case-by-case basis.",25,641,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00641
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Under the Bill, we plan to further streamline this process by having a simplified set of guidelines in place to facilitate the respectful and non-commercial use of the image of the flag on attire, including sporting attire, where users are not required to obtain any prior approval. However, Sport Singapore will continue to work closely with NSAs to advise them on the respectful use of the image of the flag on their team attire.",26,642,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00642

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,We agree with both Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Darryl David that clear and accessible guidelines on the use of the national symbols are important to give the public and users the assurance that the national symbols are treated with due respect.,29,645,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00645
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Currently, those who wish to use the national symbols can find on the NHB website the background, guidelines, FAQs and requirements for use of each symbol.

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The question of how we ought to define disrespectful use is an important one which had come up in our public engagements, including those with the creative industry. Some clear examples of disrespectful use which we have encountered and dealt with in the past include works with the image of the flag alongside images featuring nudity and violence. These are considered disrespectful use. Using the design of the flag on undergarments is considered disrespectful use. Displaying images of a damaged or a torn flag in the context of denigrating the nation is considered disrespectful use. Mr Yip Hon Weng's example of applying an image of the flag on paraphernalia to be burned as religious offerings would fall into this category.",31,647,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00647
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Very often, and in many cases, the context, nature of use and intent behind the use of the symbols have to be carefully considered to determine if the usage of the image was disrespectful or inappropriate – the context, nature of use, intent of the use.",32,648,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00648
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Darryl David brought up several examples, such as remixing the national anthem, using the pledge in a performance, or getting a tattoo, a permanent tattoo, not a temporary one as I had mentioned in my opening speech – getting a tattoo image of the lion head.",33,649,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00649
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To reduce ambiguity, I want to assure Members we intend to develop more specific guidelines based on clearly articulated principles to establish common standards of what might constitute respectful and what might constitute disrespectful treatment of the national symbols. For instance, whether on attire or decoration, any use of the image of the flag should avoid it being easily soiled or stepped upon.",34,650,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00650
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For other symbols like the national anthem, guidelines would include using the complete official lyrics and music when rearranging the anthem and ensuring that the anthem is not incorporated into any other medley or composition. For both the anthem and the pledge, the guidelines would also address questions on potential commercial uses of these symbols.",35,651,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00651
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,We also intend to make provisions under the Bill for a stop order to be issued against disrespectful use of the national symbols. Failure to comply with a stop order would constitute an offence.,36,652,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00652
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"So, if you think about it, the use of the stop order would reduce uncertainty about what constitutes an offence. This will also help to clearly address cases of misuse.",37,653,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00653
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Like what Mr Darryl David mentioned in his speech, it is really not possible for the guidelines to cover all possible scenarios. Earlier on, I cited some examples. I think it is clearer to everyone.",38,654,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00654
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We are also very mindful that the guidelines should not be too rigid or too prescriptive, as this might inhibit creativity and greater use of the national symbols. I want to assure all Members in the House that MCCY will carefully consider the points which have been raised by Members in our next steps of development. I want to assure everyone that we aim to provide as much clarity on the usage and design guidelines for the national symbols as we can. The updated guidelines will be published once the regulations under the Bill are enacted in 2023.",39,655,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00655

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,I also want to assure the Members that we aim to strike a good balance between giving Singaporeans the latitude to use the national symbols creatively and ensuring due respect for them.,41,657,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00657
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Madam, the third group of questions I would like to address pertains to safeguarding the symbols.

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"These questions are, indeed, important.

The objective here is to provide greater flexibility for members of the public to use the national symbols to identify with our nation.",43,659,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00659
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,I think Members would agree with me that with greater flexibility comes greater responsibility. Sounds familiar? This really means that stronger safeguards are necessary to ensure that individuals and organisations use the national symbols in a respectful manner. Penalties should be reasonable and commensurate with the severity of the misuse.,44,660,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00660
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We envision that the broad categories of offences under the new regulations will include, for example, using a national or Presidential symbol that conveys state sanction or authority without permission; using a national or Presidential symbol outside the prescribed manner; and failure to cease disrespectful use when ordered to do so.",45,661,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00661

2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In response to Mr Louis Ng's question whether the Government would consider creating an enhanced punishment for those who misuse the national symbols to mislead others, I would like to state that egregious offences like the desecration or deliberate burning of the flag, as well as the intentional use of the state crest, flag or Presidential symbols to misrepresent the Government or deceive the public, would attract higher penalties.",47,663,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00663
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"On the other hand, as Mr Leon Perera mentioned, minor infractions, such as the inadvertent failure to remove the flag after a designated display period, will not incur such penalties.",48,664,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00664
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked if an image of the flag on the uniforms of security guards would be viewed as an offence. I want to assure him and all the Members who spoke that, in practice, MCCY and NHB do not impose penalties as a first course of action. Our approach for these cases would be to educate and inform the public on the guidelines and request that the flag be removed.",49,665,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00665
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For other similar cases of misuse, such as inadvertently hanging the flag the wrong way, we also find that this approach of public education and raising public awareness works very well.",50,666,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00666
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,We agree with Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Leon Perera about the importance of public education and public awareness to prevent any unintentional misuse of the national symbols. Individuals who have inadvertently misused a symbol should be given a chance to explain and not be penalised for an honest mistake.,51,667,2022-09-13-T-014-S-00667
2022-09-13-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In addition, we note Ms Joan Pereira's observation about the lack of a suitable area to display the flag for certain residents, such as those in public rental housing flats.

Over the years, public housing options for singles have gradually expanded ever since the introduction of the Single Singapore Citizen scheme in 1991. However, since the scheme’s inception almost 30 years ago, one key policy requirement has remained unchanged – that singles must be at least 35 years old to be eligible to purchase public housing.",2,692,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00692

2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"This proposal would be a critical change, yet a continuation of the Government’s efforts over the years to expand HDB options for singles, while still allowing HDB to give priority to providing for families.

Moreover, while the average of 20,000 BTO flats between 2021 and 2025 is an increase, compared to an average of 17,000 flats between 2016 and 2020, this is still 13% below the average of 23,000 flats in 2011 to 2015, during the time when Mr Khaw Boon Wan was the Minister for National Development and sought to address the backlog in the supply of HDB flats.",11,701,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00701

This is worrying, especially when we look at the recent August BTO exercise, where the overall application rates are seeing no signs of letting up, with that for 2-room Flexi flats at 5.5 times and that for 3-room and larger flats at 8.3 times.",14,704,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00704
2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While I acknowledge that our proposal on singles’ BTO eligibility could increase marginal demand for 2-room Flexi flats, it does not detract from the fact that there appears to be serious imbalances in the housing market, the spillover effects of which is evident for all to see in the secondary market, where HDB resale prices have increased by 25% in the last three years, with prices today 12% higher, compared to just one year ago, and prices showing no signs of slowing down, increasing by 2.8% in just the last three months alone.",15,705,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00705

2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The purchase of a BTO 2-room flexi flat, on the other hand, is a lot more affordable. Based on indicative prices of close to S$100,000 for a 2-room Flexi flat in non-mature towns in the latest August BTO launch, the monthly repayment amount over a 25-year period is only around $400 a month, a fraction of what it costs to rent in the open market.",26,716,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00716

2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, when we look back at the time before the introduction of the Single Singapore Citizen scheme, the original rationale for excluding singles from owning HDB flats was  first, to prioritise BTOs for families as the use of space in land-scarce Singapore was not optimised; and secondly, that home ownership by singles was supposedly inconsistent with the Government's social policy of encouraging marriage and preserving the traditional family unit.",28,718,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00718

2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In fact, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee recently reassured Singaporeans that the Government cares about housing for singles, when he said at the Singapore Economic Policy Forum on 29 October 2021  “Some Singaporeans remain single for a variety of reasons, including obligation to family and parents, or a matter of choice, or a matter of life course. But many still want or need their own living space. They may wonder if we care about their housing needs. To these Singaporeans, let me assure you  we do. We recognise your needs, your aspirations and your sacrifices. That’s why we’ve in fact been expanding housing options and grants for singles over the years.”",31,721,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00721

While there have recently been welcome exceptions carved out for certain special situations, such as for single parents, the general threshold of excluding singles below 35 years of age seems to have been retained by default since 1991, despite changing demographics and societal mindsets.",32,722,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00722
2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"This rule has serious implications on the growing number of singles under 35, depriving them of the security of home ownership if they are priced out of the private market, the private and HDB rental market and not having a place to call their own and build their own lives. More importantly, current policy signals to single Singaporeans that their marital status, whether by choice or due to factors beyond their control, is somehow viewed as undesirable and undeserving of Government support for home ownership.",33,723,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00723
2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, implicit in HDB's exclusion of singles under 35 is the expectation that Singaporeans should get married before turning 35 years old and that, up until that point, single Singaporeans will live with their parents. While this traditional life progression might have been more relevant back in 1991, we know now that Singaporeans are staying single for longer for myriad reasons and not necessarily moving straight from their parents’ home into a matrimonial home.",34,724,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00724
2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Contrary to popular belief that the younger generation are eschewing marriage, surveys have shown that many single Singaporeans still want to get married. In fact, over the last 20 years, the general marriage rates for resident males and females have been consistent at 43.3 for males and 40.2 for females. The latest data point on general marriage rates in 2021 is even higher on a year-on-year basis for both males and females, at 45.3 and 44.2, respectively.",35,725,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00725

2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, one of the key arguments for limiting singles’ ability to buy HDB flats relates to the allocation of resources  that in land-scarce Singapore, flats should be prioritised for families over singles. To this point, I am comforted by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s comments during the National Day Rally earlier this year, where he shared that, and I quote, “We have done our studies and planning. We will have enough space for future generations. Our problem is not finding the space to build enough flats, nor keeping homes affordable for Singaporeans. We know how to do that.”",41,731,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00731

2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"First, data from past BTO exercises shows clearly singles do not compete with young couples and families for the same type of flats in non-mature estates. The data shows that young married couples overwhelmingly apply for 3-room or larger BTO flats and very few apply for 2-room flats, whereas singles are limited to buying only 2-room flexi BTO flats. For example, in the BTO exercises since 2015, the application rate for 2-room flexi flats among first-timers have consistently been less than one time, while that for 3-room or larger BTO flats has consistently been multiple times oversubscribed. Moreover, first-timer singles can only apply for 2-room Flexi flats in non-mature locations, with a cap of 65% of the balance 60% of such flats meant for non-elderly applicants; in other words, at most, 39% of such flats.",43,733,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00733
2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"This shows that even without making any adjustments to the unit mix of various types of flats, lowering the minimum age threshold for singles to buy a BTO flat from 35 to 28 is expected to have a minimal impact on young couples’ likelihood of securing a flat.",44,734,2022-09-13-T-016-S-00734
2022-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Secondly, we are in full agreement that public housing policy should provide extra support and incentives to young couples and budding families. Having said that, providing support for young couples and families should not be viewed as mutually exclusive from expanding HDB options for singles.

More recently, we have also made changes to the BTO allocation quota. In 2013, we opened access for singles to purchase new 2-room flats from HDB under the Single Singapore Citizen (SSC) scheme.

Some mentor students in their Co-Curricular Activities and support various school programmes. Others share experiences or offer opportunities through the school’s education and career guidance programmes.",1,861,2022-09-13-T-032-S-00861
2022-09-13-T-032,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Schools work with many community partners, including alumni groups, Parent Support Groups, and other community partners. Some of our Primary schools have Parent Support Groups which support the daily running of the school and school programmes. MOE has also been strengthening partnerships with the community. For instance, one of the key initiatives of UPLIFT (Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce) is to strengthen school-community partnerships to enhance support for vulnerable students. The support is provided through befriending, mentoring or interest-based programmes. MOE actively matches relevant community resources with schools whose students would benefit most from these programmes.",2,862,2022-09-13-T-032-S-00862

Some applicants may also be given a queue number and invited to select a flat, but they may decline to do so. From past sale launches, about 40% of the invited flat applicants did not proceed to book a flat. As such, it is not meaningful to track the median wait time between the first flat application and when the applicant books a flat in an NME.",1,873,2022-09-13-T-035-S-00873
2022-09-13-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On average, over the past few years, almost 90% of first-timer families applying to NMEs managed to secure their BTO flats within two attempts. First-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two or more NME BTO attempts are given an additional ballot chance in their subsequent application for a BTO flat in NMEs. As a result of this policy, virtually all first-timer families have been successful within their first three tries for an NME BTO flat over the past few years.",2,874,2022-09-13-T-035-S-00874
2022-09-13-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In view of the strong housing demand from first-timer applicants, HDB has recently adjusted the first-timer NME BTO allocation quotas with effect from the August 2022 BTO exercise to give first-timer applicants greater certainty in securing an NME BTO flat. At least 85% of the 3-room BTO flat supply and 95% of the 4-room and bigger BTO flat supply in the NMEs are now set aside for first-timer families. This is up from the previous levels of at least 70% and 85% respectively. As the adjustments to the first-timer NME BTO quotas are recent, it would be premature to comment on the extent to which the adjustments will improve the success rate of first-timers.",3,875,2022-09-13-T-035-S-00875
2022-09-13-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To meet the strong housing demand, HDB has also been ramping up the supply of BTO flats and will launch up to 23,000 flats per year in 2022 and 2023. This is a significant increase of 35% from the 17,000 flats launched in 2021. We are also prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, if needed.",4,876,2022-09-13-T-035-S-00876

In this case, the incorrect recognition of future fees from the marketing agreements presented an artificial picture of NGL’s financial position but did not translate into actual monetary gains by the company.

2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"SAF recognises that conditions during NDPs pose tighter constraints due to challenging wind conditions and limited landing area, among other factors. This is why only experienced parachutists are selected as Red Lions for NDP displays.",3,931,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00931
2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Parachutists must have made a minimum of 180 jumps to qualify for the selection tests. After they are selected for the team, they will undergo continuous and rigorous training to maintain their skills and proficiency.

2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For jumps at the Floating Platform or HDB heartlands, landing sites are carefully selected. The sites must be flat, provide sufficient space and are free from obstructions and the wind conditions within safe thresholds. A safety management plan is developed to identity potential risks and design mitigating measures. Prior to the live jump tasks, safety briefings are conducted for all involved personnel, covering pre-operations drills and emergency procedures.",5,933,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00933
2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There are clearly prescribed ""No-Go Criteria"" for jumps. These criteria include, but are not limited to, prevailing visibility of the landing site by the parachutists, communications with the pilot and ground personnel, as well as acceptable weather and wind speed. Each factor is closely monitored leading up to the actual jump. If any factor exceeds the stipulated thresholds, the jump will be cancelled without hesitation. This was what happened during the 2015 NDP, where the Red Lions segment was cancelled due to low clouds obstructing the visibility of the landing sites. More recently, a planned morning jump on 7 August 2022 for the heartland NDP celebrations at Ghim Moh was postponed to the evening due to weather conditions.",6,934,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00934

The Committee includes independent experts outside the SAF in sky diving and military freefall. They have also been tasked to determine if there have been systemic changes, such as stronger wind, other weather conditions or local environment, which have increased the risks. Their findings will also have a bearing on routine training. The Committee has met and let me share some of their preliminary findings.",7,935,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00935
2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The measured surface wind speeds during the Red Lion rehearsals and NDP 2022 were within the acceptable range stipulated in the SAF’s safety regulations. As to the specific cause of the incident during NDP, the current assessment is that a sudden change in wind conditions during 3WO Heng’s final approach contributed to his hard landing. Red Lion 3WO Heng had assessed that his parachute canopy was unstable and executed the ""parachute landing fall"" technique in accordance with existing protocol. His actions mitigated the impact of the hard landing and, consequently, he did not suffer severe injuries.",8,936,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00936
2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I have asked the Committee why specific incidents like this had not occurred before, since changes in wind conditions cannot only have occurred for NDP 2022. They are consulting the external experts on this specific question, as well as reviewing in detail the approach route taken by 3WO Heng. Other issues to be examined include the impact of eddy currents caused by the design of the Floating Platform, the stage and the spectator stands. These findings will be relevant to the design and construction of the NS Square, which will be a permanent site for subsequent NDPs.",9,937,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00937
2022-09-13-T-043,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,The Committee is also examining possible measures to enhance safety. One change being considered is increasing the distance between parachutists. This will provide the parachutists more reaction time as they approach the landing zone and enable the landing to be more spaced out.,10,938,2022-09-13-T-043-S-00938

While the PM2.5 levels measured during peak hours at some underground train stations along the North-South and East-West lines exceeded the 24-hour mean exposure limit, the health risk to rail workers is low as they, generally, spend only four to five hours a day, on average, at the station platforms.",1,947,2022-09-13-T-046-S-00947

2022-09-13-T-074,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"About 65% of the annual fee of $193.7 million goes towards SHPL's debt service repayments for the loan they took out to finance the Sports Hub construction.

This would encourage responsible implementation of such measures and allow MOM to monitor the scope and scale of the measures. This would also enable the tripartite partners to step in to provide the appropriate support to both employers and employees when needed.",1,1060,2022-09-13-T-077-S-01060

The stronger exchange rate has helped to dampen imported inflationary pressures. To help Singaporeans cope with rising inflation, MOF has also announced a $1.5 billion support package in June 2022. Instead of a one-off adjustment to CPF OA interest rate, the package provides more targeted and immediate relief, especially for the lower-income and vulnerable groups who are disproportionately impacted by the effects of higher prices.",2,1066,2022-09-13-T-078-S-01066
2022-09-13-T-078,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Even though the OA pegged rate remains at around 0.09%, the Government is paying up to 3.5% on the OA balances due to the 1% extra interest and the statutory minimum of 2.5%.
