2022-10-04-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what measures are being taken to address the growing sentiment that Singapore property market is unaffordable for the masses; (b) how will the recent adjustments to manpower policies impact property prices; and (c) beyond existing cooling measures, what else will the Government do to ensure housing remains affordable for Singaporeans if housing market conditions do not improve.",1,1,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00001
2022-10-04-T-001,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry has conducted or will conduct studies on the impact of rising public housing prices on marriage and fertility rates.,1,2,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00002
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, Sir, Question No 2 on today's Order Paper on the issue of marriage and parenthood is also relevant to this question on public housing affordability. As such, may I request, Sir, that the answers to Question Nos 1 and 2 be provided first, and the supplementary questions from Members on both questions be taken together thereafter.",1,3,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00003
2022-10-04-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please proceed.,1,4,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00004
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thank you, Sir. This reply will also respond to the Member's question for 3 October on affordability benchmarks for public housing.",1,5,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00005
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, over the past two years, there has been strong, broad-based demand for housing, including in the Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale market. There are a number of reasons for this. First, we have seen more households forming as the echo-boomer generation – those who are in their 30s today – are getting married, especially with the easing of COVID-19 measures. Next, we also see societal trends shifting to smaller households, as young couples, singles, as well as adult children choose to buy their own homes instead of living together with their parents. These aspirations for more personal space may have been accentuated during the pandemic. Third, more homebuyers have also turned to the resale market because of longer waiting times for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats due to construction delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fourth, in the last two years, we have also seen more private property owners and existing HDB owners cashing out on their property and going into the HDB resale market.",2,6,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00006
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To be clear, foreigners are not allowed to buy HDB flats and would not have contributed to the increase in demand for public housing. They also account for a small proportion of overall private residential property demand.",3,7,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00007
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"These demand factors, alongside the previous low interest rate environment that made it cheaper to service a home loan, have put upward pressure on HDB resale flat prices. Since the Government implemented a broad package of measures in December 2021, the HDB Resale Price Index has increased by 5.3% in the first half of this year. We understand the concerns about housing affordability and have, therefore, been carefully monitoring the housing market.",4,8,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00008
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are committed to keeping public housing affordable and accessible, to meet the housing aspirations of Singaporeans and to help Singaporeans own their own homes. This is a key longstanding national priority and provides the basic foundation for us to raise our families, bring up our children and build strong communities.",5,9,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00009
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"That is why we continue to build and sell new HDB flats at prices below the market as they come with significant subsidies. The average price for a new 4-room flat in a non-mature estate has remained relatively stable at $341,000 in 2019 and $348,000 in the first three quarters of this year. We have managed to keep prices relatively stable as market subsidies have been increased, to keep new flats affordable. Eligible first-timer buyers can also receive Enhanced CPF Housing Grants (EHG) of up to $80,000, with more help for lower-income buyers.",6,10,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00010
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For new flats in prime, central locations, we have introduced the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) Model which provides additional subsidies on top of the substantial subsidies already provided for BTO flats. This is to keep flats in such locations affordable for a wider range of Singaporeans.",7,11,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00011
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member has asked if we should have affordability benchmarks and if these should consider families at the 30th percentile of income, instead of just median income. Sir, our affordability benchmarks do not only consider median incomes, as we provide a wide range of BTO flats for first-timer buyers with different housing needs and budgets.",8,12,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00012
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Take, for example, a first-timer household earning about $5,000, which is slightly less than the 30th percentile of resident household incomes. They may buy a 4-room flat in any of the three non-mature estate projects in the recent August 2022 BTO exercise, namely in Jurong East, Woodlands and Choa Chu Kang. These projects come with typical prices comparable to, or lower than, the average price of BTO flats in non-mature estates at about $348,000. After factoring in the $45,000 in grants they would receive, they will need to use about 23% of their monthly income for their housing loan, which means that they will be able to service their mortgages from their monthly Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions with no cash outlay. This also works out to a home price-to-income ratio of around five for this family, which means that the price of their home is about five times their annual household income.",9,13,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00013
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For a first-timer couple who are both fresh tertiary graduates buying their first home, a typical combined starting salary would be about $6,500. They would receive $30,000 in grants and would only need to use 18% of their monthly income for their housing loan to afford the same new 4-room flats in any of the non-mature estate projects in the recent August 2022 BTO exercise, with typical prices comparable to or lower than $348,000. This works out to a home price-to-income ratio of around four for this family, and they would also be able to service their mortgage fully from their CPF contributions.",10,14,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00014
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As a broad comparison, the ratio of the median home price to the median household income in other comparable cities, such as London, Los Angeles and Sydney are much higher, at between eight and 15 times. In Hong Kong, it is more than 20 times.",11,15,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00015
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For resale flats, the Government provides significant housing grants of up to $160,000 to ensure that resale flats remain affordable for eligible first-timer families. We review our grants regularly to ensure that resale flats remain affordable.",12,16,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00016
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Generally, the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR), which is the proportion of monthly income used to service mortgage instalment payments, has remained below 25% for most new and resale first-timer flat buyers taking on an HDB loan. This is well below the international benchmark of between 30% and 35%. This means that most first-timer buyers can service their housing loans using their monthly CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay.",13,17,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00017
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member also asked what the Government will do to ensure housing is affordable for Singaporeans in the wider Singapore property market. We have announced, on 30 September this year – measures to moderate demand in the HDB resale market to ensure that HDB flats continue to remain affordable, as well as measures to encourage prudent borrowing amidst the rising interest rate environment.",14,18,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00018
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, we introduced a wait-out period of 15 months before private property owners are allowed to purchase a non-subsidised HDB resale flat. This measure aims to moderate demand and slow the momentum of price increases in the HDB resale market, by deferring demand from private property owners, so that HDB resale flats will continue to be an affordable option for first-time HDB flat buyers. We intend for this measure to be temporary and will review this, depending on overall demand and market changes.",15,19,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00019
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Previously, private residential property owners looking to buy a non-subsidised HDB resale flat do not have to serve a wait-out period, but they will need to sell their private properties within six months of the HDB flat purchase. In particular, the number of private property owners buying HDB resale flats has doubled in 2021 and the first three quarters of this year, as compared to 2019 and 2020. Overall, private property owners and former private property owners make up about one in 10 HDB resale flat buyers.",16,20,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00020
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Private residential property owners, generally, have more financial means to buy resale flats, as compared to first-time home buyers or existing HDB-owners. Some might not even need to take loans to complete their purchase. They, therefore, tend to pay higher amounts of cash-over-valuation (COV) when buying HDB resale flats.",17,21,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00021
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Having said that, we recognise that not all private residential property owners are in the same situation. Some seniors need to sell their private property and move to an HDB flat to strengthen their retirement adequacy. So, we are exempting seniors above the age of 55 who are moving from a private property to a 4-room or a smaller resale flat from the wait-out period.",18,22,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00022
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We also know that there are private residential property owners, whatever their age, who face genuine housing needs or who have to sell their homes because of extenuating circumstances, such as financial difficulties. They should approach HDB for assistance, and my colleagues will see how best to support them on a case-by-case basis.",19,23,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00023
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Next, we are also mindful of the challenges posed by the rising interest rate environment. From 2013 to 2021, we have had exceptionally low interest rates, especially from financial institutions. But market interest rates have risen over the last year, with further increases expected over the medium term. This will increase borrowing costs for those who are buying a home and also for those who are servicing existing home loans pegged to floating rates. Therefore, we have decided to move now to safeguard home buyers and ensure that they are able to service their long-term home loans.",20,24,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00024
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,We have thus implemented the following measures to tighten the maximum amount that can be taken for home loans and ensure prudent borrowing.,21,25,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00025
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have raised the medium-term rate floor used under the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) and MSR frameworks to compute a borrower's maximum loan quantum for residential property loans granted by private financial institutions from 3.5% to 4% per annum. The actual rates that private financial institutions charge for home loans will, however, continue to be determined by them.",22,26,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00026
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Next, HDB will introduce an interest rate floor of 3% per annum to compute a borrower's maximum eligible housing loan amount. This is 1% below the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) rate floor for private financial institutions. This will reduce the maximum loan quantum for home buyers taking HDB loans but will not increase the monthly instalment borrowers have to pay, as there is no change to the HDB concessionary interest rate of 2.6%.",23,27,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00027
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have also lowered the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit for HDB housing loans from 85% to 80%, so that home buyers borrow prudently in view of the uncertain economic outlook and rising interest rate environment. This is not expected to affect first-timer and lower-income flat buyers significantly, as they receive housing grants of up to $80,000 when buying a subsidised flat directly from HDB, or up to $160,000 when buying a resale flat, and can tap on their CPF savings to pay for the flat purchase.",24,28,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00028
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"These measures are necessary as property loans are long-term commitments and often a household's largest liability. The higher floor rates ensure that today's borrowers take loans that reflect the likelihood of rising interest rates and avoid overstretching themselves. If we do not move now, households may run into housing difficulties when they find it harder to service their housing obligations. This is already happening in other countries where we see home owners defaulting on their mortgage payments and losing their homes.",25,29,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00029
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Beyond the cooling measures, we recognise that there is genuine demand from home buyers. We have, therefore, also increased supply in both public and private housing markets. For HDB, we have ramped up our BTO supply and are on track to launch 23,000 flats per year in 2022 and 2023, or a 35% increase from 2021. In November this year, we will launch more than 9,500 BTO flats. We are prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, if needed. We also endeavour to launch more projects with a shorter waiting time of less than three years where possible.",26,30,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00030
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The supply of private housing on the Confirmed List of the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme has also been increased by 75% from 2021 to 2022. We are prepared to increase supply further to meet the demand for private housing, if needed.",27,31,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00031
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government will intervene and do what is necessary, to ensure a stable property market and affordable public housing for Singaporeans. This has been our approach all along. We will do so decisively but also carefully, being cognisant of the uncertain global economic outlook and rising interest rates environment, which will affect home prices and contribute to uncertainty in our property market.",28,32,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00032
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will continue to monitor the market closely and adjust our policies as necessary on both housing demand and supply, to ensure that prices move broadly in line with economic fundamentals.",29,33,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00033
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"This Government is committed to the stability of the wider Singapore property market and to keeping public housing inclusive, affordable and accessible to Singaporeans.",30,34,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00034
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Speaker, many different factors affect marriage and fertility rates. These include shifts in societal norms and attitudes towards marriage and parenthood over time, and temporal factors such as the restrictions and disruptions caused by COVID-19.",1,35,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00035
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"While we have not conducted studies on the impact of housing prices on marriage and fertility rates, our regular surveys and engagements indicate that many couples continue to aspire to have their own home before they start a family.",2,36,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00036
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We recognise these aspirations and preferences, that is why public housing policies are designed to prioritise and support first-timer families to enable them to have their own home and start a family.",3,37,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00037
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"For example, the vast majority of our BTO flat supply is set aside for first-timer families. The quota of 3-room and 4-room BTO flats in non-mature estates set aside for first-timer families, was increased to 85% and 95% respectively.",4,38,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00038
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"For mature estates, we continue to set aside 95% of BTO flat supply for first-timer families. First-timer families also have more ballot chances than second-timer families, to improve their likelihood of securing a flat.",5,39,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00039
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In addition, the Government has put in place various grants and measures to help Singaporean couples own their first home. Eligible first-timer buyers who buy new flats can enjoy an enhanced CPF housing grant of up to $80,000, on top of the generous subsidies in new flat prices. Those who choose to buy a resale flat can enjoy housing grants of up to $160,000 dollars.",6,40,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00040
2022-10-04-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In 2021, about 7,000 families received grants for their resale flat purchase.

2022-10-04-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for National Development for his reply.

I have two supplementary questions in line with this train of thought.",1,45,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00045
2022-10-04-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, would the Government consider increasing property tax rates for non-owner-occupied properties?

2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, generally, all these ideas have been raised before, different ways in which we tax property, tax rental income, increase ABSD.

2022-10-04-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"And my second follow-up is, whether the Ministry has an estimate based on their models of when they expect house price increases to moderate after the application of the recently announced cooling measures.",2,51,2022-10-04-T-001-S-00051
2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to answer the first question in two parts.

2022-10-04-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The construction delays impacted BTO launches that were set off prior to COVID-19.

Many are reluctant to even try looking for work because of their bad experiences with age discrimination. Age discrimination is in the workplace is rooted in ageism, which is an attitude of the heart.

That effort will be an ongoing one. It is not going to be something that we can do in a short period of time, because sometimes this messaging does take a while to percolate. And unfortunately, I think that sometimes until a person reaches a point where he or she faces that dilemma or the issue, some people may not be open to seek information or receive educational materials, when the thing comes. We are working actively through the unions who are representatives within the companies to also be a bit of a gatekeeper on how employers take care of the older workers within the company.",1,97,2022-10-04-T-003-S-00097

In fact, for this Employment Assistant Payment (EAP), the amount has been something that has been determined and a tripartite consensus is in the guidelines. There is a fixed formula which is used; so, it is not something that we just pluck a number out of thin air. Let me just briefly say that for those who are aged 63 to less than 65.5 years old, the number of months of salary payable is 3.5 months and for those who are 65.5 years old to less than 68 years old, in the formula, it provides for two months of salary payable.

I think in adjudicating some of the compensation quantums, the Minister for Manpower will objectively look at the facts of the case because each case is different. There are cases in which the employer may have to bear some responsibility, and there are cases in which also the employee himself or herself has got to bear part of the responsibility for, perhaps, not communicating, or not performing, or not indicating his or her interest to further the re-employment contract.",1,110,2022-10-04-T-003-S-00110

The health status of the employee also has to be looked into, because certain jobs will require a certain degree of medical fitness to continue. Therefore, it is not a one-size-fits-all type of calculation on the compensation amount. I hope that kind of gives the Member a sense of how we look at it in terms of the matrix.

2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, we hope to avoid the tiers because it is very painful. But to your question, is there a target number? I would say the more the better. I think we are also very cognisant of the fact that seniors tend to take a longer time to become familiar with the digital domain and they would want to gain confidence a step at a time. So, we would not want to rush the seniors.",1,123,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00123
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We also do not want the seniors to feel that the only way they can have a meaningful life is to engage digitally. There are other things that are meaningful, but adding the digital dimension can help them to keep in touch with their friends through new means; to plug into opportunities for recreation, for understanding the world and to engage with society in a way that they could not have done so before. But it is important to note that we should let them take it at their own pace.",2,124,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00124
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Right now, we have organised some of the programmes according to tiers. Individuals can decide. I should also add that, in fact, once they gain confidence in going digital, some of the seniors are very savvy. They are so good that they can teach their friends how to become more effective. And then the question becomes  how are they able to learn new knowledge to teach their friends? In fact, through online resources, they are already able to become even more competent. So, that would be the approach that we take.",3,125,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00125
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is also not just the programmes that matter. I think there are many touch points that seniors can come into contact with, and we do not want to assume that it is only the Government who can provide programmes that will work and be effective. Crowding in the partners is equally important, because it is also a question of building trust with the seniors, so that they are receptive to what is being shared with them.",4,126,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00126

Sir, I appreciate the extensive community outreach effort by the SG digital office, helping the seniors to be familiarised with the digital tools, and also the scam preventions. I would like to ask the Minister, in going forward, should the focus be more on practical applications, for example, the apps and functions that can help the seniors in their daily life. For example, how to use Singpass, calling a cab, ordering food, TeleConsult and so on.",1,128,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00128
2022-10-04-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"And if I may come back to my Parliamentary Question, on the polyclinic appointment bookings. With COVID-19 cases still high, the polyclinics are obviously very busy with high numbers of visits. Many of the seniors were told to book online and there are only limited walk-ins that you can book, but they are feeling helpless about how they can make a booking through the online platforms and how to go through the whole process – including using a Singpass, Singnet profiles and so on. Can I ask the Minister, if the digital office could also look at how to assist seniors to help them in some of these functions for their daily lives?",2,129,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00129
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Liang for his questions. If I could, perhaps, take a bit of time to just share with the Member and other colleagues an overview of the Seniors Go Digital programme curriculum. It is broken up into several modules. The first module is on connectivity and communication. And the applications are, for example, on smartphone features like how to use Wireless@SG, how to use WhatsApp, how to use Zoom. Then, there is another module specifically on access to Government Digital Services, TraceTogether, Singpass mobile. And yet another module on entertainment, MeLISTEN, MeWATCH and using NLB's Libby app.",1,130,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00130
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, there is quite a range of things. In particular, there are several other features that would be of particular use to our seniors. For example, in the health module, the seniors are guided on how to use HealthHub and how to use Healthy 365. So, it is quite structured. But again, it all depends on the seniors' comfort level and what they find to be useful.",2,131,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00131
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I should just add that, inherent in Mr Liang's question is also a tension. There is a tension in wanting to help the seniors become more familiar with a range of digital applications and so nudging them in that direction to use digital services, as a motivation for them to learn about the tools and how to go digital. And on the other hand, recognising that some of these seniors will find this a very difficult task and they might actually feel very anxious. So, between the two, we have to find the right balance and try to move things forward.",3,132,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00132
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Our overall approach is to make the options available and to still make the non-digital avenues open. They may not be as convenient as the digital avenues, but it does not mean that seniors do not have the non-digital options available to them. The CDC vouchers is a very good example. Many seniors over time have learnt and gained confidence on how to use the digital vouchers, but there remains a group that far prefers to use the physical vouchers and those options still remain visible.",4,133,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00133
2022-10-04-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In summary, we will continue to nudge forward, and we will continue to offer options for seniors who feel more confident and want to move to the next level of their digital engagement. But we will also want to be very mindful that some seniors are still not yet comfortable, and we want to offer them that sense of confidence that they are not being pushed in a direction that they do not wish to go.",5,134,2022-10-04-T-004-S-00134

2022-10-04-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you. The proposed beverage container return scheme aims to encourage good recycling practices, conserve resources and reduce waste and carbon emissions. This is in line with our Zero Waste Masterplan and contributes towards our climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century. The scheme, which was first proposed by the Citizens' Workgroup on #RecycleRight in 2019, will be the first phase of an Extended Producer Responsibility, or EPR, approach to manage packaging waste.",1,140,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00140
2022-10-04-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"This Extended Producer Responsibility approach means that the scheme will be funded by producers of pre-packaged beverages. Under the EPR approach, beverage producers, such as manufacturers and importers, will be responsible for the collection and recycling of the products they put out on the market as well as funding the scheme. This is similar to the EPR scheme that was implemented for e-waste in 2021.",2,141,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00141
2022-10-04-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Under the beverage container return scheme, a small refundable deposit will be applied when a consumer buys a pre-packaged beverage. I must emphasise that this is a refundable deposit. Consumers will get a full refund of their deposits when they return their empty beverage containers at designated return points. Compared to non-deposit-based recycling schemes, the refundable deposit will encourage a higher recycling rate and aggregate a stream of cleaner and higher quality recyclables that can be used to produce new products, thus enhancing the resource loop. Similar schemes in countries such as Norway, Sweden and Lithuania, have achieved return rates of 80% or higher.",3,142,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00142
2022-10-04-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Producers typically appoint an operator to carry out their responsibilities under the scheme. Based on the experience of other countries, a not-for-profit, industry-led scheme operator is preferred. It will be able to tap on the industry's capabilities and resources, such as existing logistics channels to make use of backhaul trips to improve operational synergies. As the scheme is owned and run by the industry, it will have a strong incentive to operate the scheme efficiently and cost-effectively, to keep scheme costs low for all parties. In addition, the revenue from the sale of clean, high quality and high value recyclables, and any unclaimed deposits, will be utilised by the scheme operator to reduce the scheme costs. In Singapore, the eventual cost pass-through to consumers in beverage prices, if any, will likely be moderated by price competition among industry players. This is also the experience in other countries that have implemented similar schemes.",4,143,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00143
2022-10-04-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"To ensure that the scheme operator operates efficiently, cost effectively and fairly across multiple producers, the Government will exercise regulatory oversight over the scheme operator.

2022-10-04-T-005,,,"To develop the scheme framework for Singapore, my Ministry and NEA have conducted over two years of extensive engagements and consultations with stakeholders, including members of the public and over 250 beverage producers, retailers and waste management companies. We have taken into account their feedback and views in developing a proposed scheme framework, and we are currently conducting further public consultation via REACH.

2022-10-04-T-005,,,"We are proposing for the scheme to cover plastic bottles and metal cans as a start, as these have high material value, high consumption rates and are easy to collect and compact. We also propose to include all beverage types to reduce consumer confusion and maximise the number of containers that can be collected for recycling. The scheme would include containers from 150 millilitres to three litres, which can be accepted by typical reverse vending machines. With these proposed parameters, the scheme is estimated to cover more than one billion beverage containers in Singapore each year.",2,146,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00146
2022-10-04-T-005,,,"In designing the scheme, we will make it easy for consumers to understand, to enable each of us to play our part in building a circular economy. We will need to have an extensive network of conveniently located return points to enable consumers to easily claim their deposit refunds. Based on a survey conducted with 1,000 households, supermarkets were among the most preferred return locations across all the age segments and are a major sales channel for prepackaged beverages. We have thus proposed that large supermarkets with a total floor area of more than 200 square metres be mandated to set up return points. This will cover about 400 large supermarkets. We also welcome operators of other premises, such as mall operators and smaller retailers, to voluntarily set up return points. Based on experiences overseas, this can increase footfall to stores.",3,147,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00147
2022-10-04-T-005,,,"The scheme operator pays handling fees to return point operators, to reimburse the costs incurred. To build the return point network, NEA will work closely with the future scheme operator to identify and set up return points in suitable community and public spaces, such as Community Clubs, sports facilities and large, well-patronised hawker centres, to increase accessibility. Return point operators can choose manual over-the-counter return points or opt for automated reverse vending machines.",4,148,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00148

There is a wide range of such premises, from casual settings to more formal settings, and each would have its own preference. For example, stallholders could serve the customer the beverage with its container and charge the deposit, in which case, the customers can take away the empty beverage containers and return them at designated return points to claim the refund on their deposit. Alternatively, stallholders could pour the beverage into a cup before serving, in which case, they do not need to charge the deposit as the customer does not receive the beverage container. In this case, the stallholder can collect the empty beverage containers and claim the refund of the deposits on the containers. We expect the former to apply in more casual settings, such as coffee shops and hawker centres, as the shop owners would typically have their customers pay the deposit and then take the beverage container.",5,149,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00149

My supplementary question is in relation to continuing cost-benefit analysis for this scheme. In 2001, Israel introduced a deposit refund law for glass and plastic containers smaller than 1.5 litres. A cost-benefit analysis in 2010 was done and it concluded that the law had a positive impact, with total benefits exceeding total cost by around 35%. In the same vein, can the Senior Minister of State and the Ministry also consider a similar cost-benefit analysis and a regular reporting can be done on the effectiveness of the scheme, including possible recommendations of expansion of the scheme, if that is beneficial?",1,153,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00153

So, as I have noted, NEA has regulatory oversight over the scheme operator. So, it will require the scheme operator to regularly track as well as report on the scheme outcomes and related fees, for instance, the producer fees and the return targets. In fact, we will set a return target for the scheme operator, and we will work with the future scheme operator to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme outcomes as well as further refinements to the scheme.",1,154,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00154

With regard to challenges, as I have alluded to, in order to facilitate return of the beverage containers, which is really the key objective of this scheme, that is, to nudge consumers' behaviour, nudge them to recycle the beverage containers, we will need to have an extensive network of return points to make it easily and conveniently accessible to the consumers, so that they can return and get back their deposit.",1,159,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00159
2022-10-04-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For a start, we are mandating the large supermarkets above 200 square metres to have these return points because our survey and engagements with the public have shown that that is one of the most popular return point locations. Of course, it is also the single largest sales channel for prepackaged beverages. About a third of the total sales volume of prepackaged beverages is through the supermarkets and there will be about 400 of them, which is about two-thirds of the number of supermarkets that we have in Singapore.",2,160,2022-10-04-T-005-S-00160

And, of course, some retailers, as is the experience in other countries do come forward to volunteer to have designated return points because that has been shown to increase footfall and, therefore, spending at the stores. So, we will implement this and then, monitor to see whether that is adequate and we can always refine this.

So, for instance, when they send new stocks, they can take back the used beverage containers. In addition to that, it is really a strong incentive since they are paying producers' fees to keep scheme costs low.

2022-10-04-T-007,,,The Police do not track the number of officers who have sought counselling or para-counselling assistance. Officers are not required to report their engagement of such assistance as the confidentiality of help-seeking is important to encourage officers with problems to come forward. Officers who seek help are not specifically disadvantaged in their career because they had sought help.

It can cover various topics and the culture that the Minister of State mentioned as well. It will also be useful for APOs or other frontline or first responders who may not be familiar with current available help right now.",3,189,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00189

In my earlier reply, I had talked about the resilience training, which is conducted for ground officers across the Home Team departments. There are also simplified and easy to use toolkits which will help supervisors identify officers who are in distress. In addition, resources of support are shared regularly with officers through various channels.",4,193,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00193

2022-10-04-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"First, I join the hon Member Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim in asking whether there has been any study to correlate the suicide cases with any stressors, for example, because of exposure to traumatic incidents, whether the reaction arises from post-traumatic kinds of stresses. Sorry, I am getting ahead of myself. Really, at the end of the day, if we were to identify the psychosocial factors that contribute to such suicides, I think we will be in a better position to prevent suicides in the first place. That is the thrust of my question.",2,197,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00197
2022-10-04-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"The second question is in relation to harnessing geo-positioning or geo-fencing technology with respect to APOs. I understand that they are being recruited from a wider background and many of them have static duties. So, I wonder whether technology can be harnessed such that if they leave their post and they are bearing arms, there could be some proactivity in managing such situations and, hopefully, prevent any untoward incidents as well.",3,198,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00198

2022-10-04-T-007,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the first point, I had mentioned in my earlier reply that we do conduct surveys to collect staff feedback at regular junctures. We also have regular engagement exercises with our staff officers at various levels, sometimes on very large platforms and sometimes on much smaller platforms.",2,200,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00200
2022-10-04-T-007,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"For instance, for myself, I engage officers over breakfast – sometimes, 10 to 20 people – to hear the tensions they may be facing, the stresses they may be facing, to really get ground-up feedback to get a sense of what they are facing, whether or not it is in their personal lives or whether or not it is what they are facing in terms of their everyday work environment. It is through these engagements that we get a sense of what are some of the stressors that they may be facing.",3,201,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00201
2022-10-04-T-007,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"As I mentioned in my earlier reply, this is continuous, ongoing work. We will need the help of family and friends, because family and friends are often the most connected to these officers and they would know if there were any life-changing events that will throw them off course and lead them to choose a very unfortunate way out. So, this is continuous work in progress.",4,202,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00202
2022-10-04-T-007,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the second point the Member mentioned about geo-fencing, we can have a think about it, but I think we do have to balance the need for privacy as well as the needs of the job, but we thank the Member very much for that suggestion.",5,203,2022-10-04-T-007-S-00203

2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"At the national level, Singapore has a clear, well-established policy on drugs. In the context of sport, Singapore has a framework of rules and standards to keep sports in Singapore free of doping, including the use of both recreational drugs and performance-enhancing drugs.

2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Second, ADS works with NSAs to plan, implement and monitor education programmes for athletes. These comprise regular updates on issues, such as the currency of prohibited substances and methods, the health consequences of doping, and the rights and responsibilities of athletes. ADS also reminds NSAs and their athletes on their anti-doping obligations at all pre-Major Games briefings.",6,213,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00213
2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Third, it is mandatory for all national athletes to complete modules on the World Anti-Doping Agency's e-learning platform called the Anti-Doping Education and Learning (ADEL) Platform, to deepen their understanding of clean sports.",7,214,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00214
2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"To prevent inadvertent doping, ADS provides the ""Check Drugs"" function on its website to enable athletes and support personnel to check on the prohibited status of a particular drug or substance. The database contains more than 9,000 medications registered in Singapore and is updated monthly. For medications not on the database, athletes can and should check with a sports physician or with ADS directly.",8,215,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00215

2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"First, ADS develops and regularly reviews a test distribution plan for athletes, with higher testing frequencies for athletes assessed to be at higher risk of doping. Several factors are considered in determining the risk level of doping, such as the athlete's performance and the type of sports. ADS' testing regime covers both in-competition and out-of-competition tests.",10,217,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00217

2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Under the ADS, sanctions are imposed on athletes found to have violated anti-doping rules. These range from a few months to a lifetime ban, depending on the degree of fault, intention, type of substance used and aggravating circumstances. These sanctions are made public to send a deterrent signal to others.",12,219,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00219
2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Other sanctions may also be imposed. For instance, SportSG could suspend the spexScholarship or other support offered to a carded athlete. The NSA may also suspend training support for the athlete or their selection for competitions. The Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) or the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC) may also, separately, suspend the selection of the athlete for any Major Games for the appropriate period.",13,220,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00220

2022-10-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I agree with the Senior Parliamentary Secretary that this is key as a preventive measure. Given that many of our national athletes or perhaps, many of our athletes, get competitive much earlier on – in school, perhaps – would ADS and SportSG consider working with the relevant authorities or the relevant Government agencies to go further upstream in terms of providing education to our younger competitive athletes who would, obviously, hopefully, become national athletes, seeing as to how the youths could be a bit more impressionable, to have these education programmes further upstream such that they are aware of the pitfalls of using recreational and performance-enhancing drugs in their athletic endeavours?",2,225,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00225

2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"The pursuit of excellence in sport is not just limited to the technical aspects of it. I think this is consistent across sports, cultures and jurisdictions, if I may put it that way. In my recent visit to Europe, where I visited a few sporting centres of excellence – if I may call them that – in terms of football, I think the consistent message that has been sent is that they – these academies, these football clubs – they want to produce and create excellent footballers but, more than that, they also want to produce good individuals, individuals with good values.",2,227,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00227
2022-10-04-T-008,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"As much as the pursuit of sporting excellence is about fitness, technical competencies of each sport, it is very much also about values inculcation, the promulgation of values from one generation to the next.",3,228,2022-10-04-T-008-S-00228

New Zealand is strengthening central national healthcare planning, to reduce the pressure on specialist and hospital care on the ground. The UK is making a renewed push in integrated care between social and healthcare organisations. And just yesterday, we just heard Hong Kong is also doing a deep healthcare reform effort.",4,236,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00236

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The things we do during the pandemic – vaccinations, tests, self-isolation – and these are all preventive care in action.

It is a fundamental re-orientation and reform of our healthcare system, focus on preventive care instead of curative care, emphasise on health instead of sickness, to shift the centre of gravity of care away from hospitals, into the community, to rely less on doctors for health, but to depend on communities, our families and ourselves – and live up to the name of Ministry of Health (MOH), not Ministry of Sickness.",9,241,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00241

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I would also like to extend my appreciation to the many healthcare practitioners and partners. They range from nurses, allied health professionals, pharmacists, people who work for community organisations, unions, grassroots leaders, employers. They shared their views and contributed their ideas.",15,247,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00247
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Last but not least, I also want to thank the officers of MOH, who did a lot of the coordination, the staffing, the drafting and the preparatory work. I know they are very proud of being part of this co-creation effort with all our partners.",16,248,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00248
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Today, I will do three things. One, I will go through, very briefly, the salient features of Healthier SG as a recap. Two, explain what this means to the two most important sets of stakeholders – residents and General Practitioners (GPs). Three, I will speak more about its budget and financial implications, as this is only briefly covered in the White Paper.",17,249,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00249
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"One, to recap, there are five key components to Healthier SG.",18,250,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00250
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, family doctors. They are the lynchpin of Healthier SG. We want to mobilise them to build strong relationships with their patients and play a bigger role in preventive care.",19,251,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00251
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Two, health plans. These will be developed between doctors and patients. The health plan comprises an overview of the health status of the resident, the health goals to achieve and an action plan, which can include going for essential health screenings and vaccinations, and changes to your lifestyles. This whole area is what we call ""social prescriptions"". And doctors are saying that ""social prescriptions"" are often more important than drug prescriptions.",20,252,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00252
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"This brings us to the third component, which is community partners. It may not be easy to follow diet or exercise advice and improve lifestyles by ourselves. Many of us have tried, but to no avail. So, we will draw on the effort of agencies such as Health Promotion Board (HPB), People's Association (PA) and SportSG. They are organising many health-related activities on the ground, to create that supportive environment to help us change.",21,253,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00253
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"And once the first three components are ready, we embark on the fourth, which is the national enrolment exercise. And this will commence in the second half of 2023 next year, starting with residents aged 60 and above. Then, each resident chooses the family doctor or clinic you wish to build a long-term preventive care relationship with. And from there, we begin our journey towards better health.",22,254,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00254
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Finally, enablers. We need the right IT systems, manpower and financing structure to make Healthier SG work. These are invisible. They are in the background, but a lot of work has gone into these and they are extremely important.",23,255,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00255
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"What will all these mean to people? Let me start with the most important stakeholder group – residents, whom we represent here.",24,256,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00256
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The greatest impact is that residents will receive much stronger support to stay healthy and prevent any existing illnesses from worsening further. And we are making a big effort to support you, because it is almost human instinct to not do the right thing because of instant gratification.",25,257,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00257
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"""Have a puff to destress now, worry about health later""; ""eat the cheesecake now, worry about sugar later""; ""eat the fried chicken now, it is very nice""; ""laze around instead of exercising""; ""binge watch Korean drama instead of having a good night's sleep"". All these instant gratifications. Everyone is smiling. We are all guilty.",26,258,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00258
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Nothing bad will happen immediately or next day, but they accumulate to cause serious diseases, or can aggravate existing illnesses later. Every grain of sand you keep dropping will become a bucket. And, by then, it will be a big burden. It can cost us, our organs, our limbs, our minds, our lives.",27,259,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00259
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I visited the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recently. They told me that every day, six more patients in Singapore require dialysis  – every day, six more. To be on dialysis means you need to visit the NKF centre three times a week, each time five to six hours. Your life is totally changed.",28,260,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00260
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"And the staff told me, that most patients there at NKF regret not correcting their diets and lifestyles while they could. But now, it is too late to reverse. They have to live with dialysis the rest of their lives.",29,261,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00261
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, let us try to live without regrets. We can still enjoy many things in life, especially the good food – the char kway teow, the prata, the mee rebus, the occasional bubble tea with less sugar – just everything in moderation and without overindulging. And we will find joy in exercising, especially with friends. We will be able to snub out smoking or Juuling and not miss them.",30,262,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00262
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),The support to residents – we must support residents to do all these. And it comes in several ways. Let me just describe how we are supporting residents.,31,263,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00263
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The first and most significant form of support is your long-term relationship with the family doctor. And research has shown people with a dedicated family doctor are much less likely to develop serious illnesses. Your enrolment with a dedicated family doctor is, therefore, a critical first step.",32,264,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00264
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"However, since the release of the White Paper, there have been a few concerns on enrolment, and I might as well clarify them in this opening speech.",33,265,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00265
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Some residents are worried that once you choose a doctor, it is a final decision that cannot be reversed. Not to worry, we recognise that there are times when a resident needs to change their doctor, either because they have moved houses, or have found a more suitable doctor. And so, we have provided the flexibility for residents to change your enrolled doctor. Nevertheless, when the time comes, please make your choice carefully and consciously.",34,266,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00266
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Other residents are worried that once they enrol with a doctor, they cannot see other doctors – banned – including specialists that they are now seeing because of their chronic illnesses. So, please be assured that this would not happen. You are free to continue to visit all other doctors, including your specialists. But please choose one to be your dedicated family doctor whom you trust, who knows your conditions well and can work with you to practise preventive care.",35,267,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00267
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In the same vein, some residents are worried that their regular GP may become so popular that they get squeezed out by the demand.",36,268,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00268
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We will try our best to manage this. In the enrolment process, there will be a dropdown list. The doctor you regularly visit will be at the top for you. So, that will give you an edge over your ""competitors"". And we are working with GP networks and polyclinics to let us know who their regular patients are in order to facilitate this. We are also doing this in stages, so that enrolment demand will not be so overwhelming, overnight. You may also want to enrol early when the time comes to ""chope"" your regular GP.",37,269,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00269
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second area of support is that once you are enrolled with a family doctor, the Government will fully fund the most important aspects of preventive care.",38,270,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00270
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Hence, annual preventive care check-ins with your family doctor, nationally recommended vaccinations, such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and health screenings will be free. Health screenings will include three very common chronic conditions – type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and three cancers  breast, cervical and colorectal. These are recommended for the general population and will be free.",39,271,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00271
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Those with specific risk factors may be referred for further tests. And there are more complex screenings, like colonoscopy, which is an invasive procedure and not appropriate to be made a standard screening for everyone. Although it is not free, it will continue to be heavily subsidised at our hospitals.",40,272,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00272
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The third way to support residents – if you are using MediSave to pay for the treatment of your chronic illness, you are no longer required to co-pay 15% of the bill using cash. You can just use your MediSave.",41,273,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00273
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"These changes are somewhat of a departure from most Government subsidy schemes, where some co-payment from residents is often required to reflect the sharing of responsibility and uphold the concept of individual effort.",42,274,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00274
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Here, we have decided that since preventive care is very fundamental to healthcare, further subsidy is justified. It does not contradict the principle of personal responsibility, because in the context of preventive care, personal responsibility and action are needed to make changes and lead a healthier life.",43,275,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00275
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Fourth, we will enhance the subsidy for common chronic disease drugs at private GP clinics. Many residents gave feedback that there is a significant drug price differential between the GP clinic and the polyclinic. So, even if they wanted to stick to one family doctor at a GP clinic, when it comes to taking medications, they will go back to the polyclinic where medication is cheaper.",44,276,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00276
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"To help residents anchor with a family doctor of their choice, we intend to level this price difference, by introducing an additional subsidy tier to Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for common chronic drugs and also set drug price limits.",45,277,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00277

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I should add a small caveat, which is that the basis of calculating subsidies at polyclinics and for CHAS are different. There is a technical reason, but we will not be able to equalise the price down to the last cent. But we will substantively remove the current difference in drug prices between the two for individuals enrolled in Heathier SG.",47,279,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00279
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Fifth, we have roped in important community partners, such as PA, SportSG, HPB and others, to organise more health-related activities for residents, from ball games and brisk walking; to Zumba classes and community gardening.",48,280,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00280
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, while you may see your enrolled doctor only once or twice a year, outside of the clinic, you are not alone.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Sixth, we will award Healthpoints to help encourage residents to adopt and sustain a healthy lifestyle.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Healthpoints can be exchanged for a range of rewards, such as public transport and many participating merchants. The reward is not large, but it has a way to give us psychological satisfaction that, ""I have accomplished this exercise"". And it is a very effective nudge, especially when gamified.",52,284,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00284
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We will be enhancing Healthy 365. For example, it will be able to track your calorie intake.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"GPs need to earn a living by running their clinics. We must make sure that Healthier SG works for them. Hence, from the time we conceived Healthier SG, we were very mindful that it should not take business away from GPs. So, GPs will continue to attend to their existing patients and prescribe medication to them. What Healthier SG does is to enlarge their client pool, through enrolment for preventive and chronic care consultations.",58,290,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00290
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In line with this, GPs should be fairly compensated by MOH for their effort and advice in delivering preventive care.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"This service fee is what we will describe loosely as a ""capitated payment"". That means we do not pay the GP for every consultation, every test, every prescription and every service they provide. Instead, we pay them a standard fee, which is a base, per enrolled patient for maintaining a long-term relationship with the patient. It will cover the regular check-ins, ensuring the residents adhere with their health plans, the associated administrative work and also, reviewing the health plan annually.",60,292,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00292

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For the Government, this method of payment and subsidy is not new.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Hand on heart, MOH has always been a very fair and prompt as a service buyer and I assure GPs that we will continue to be so. What MOH may not be very good at, is to minimise your administrative workload. It is unfortunately inevitable, as we need medical data of patients to be captured in our national health record system and paperwork is needed for payment claims. We will try our best to ease this administrative workload.",66,298,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00298
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),Some GPs also do not have IT systems to support Healthier SG. Some are still largely using pen and paper. MOH will also provide a grant to each GP clinic to help them be IT-ready for Healthier SG.,67,299,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00299
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now move on to elaborate more about the finance and budget implications of Healthier SG. Healthier SG requires a lot of effort and resources to set up. We need new IT systems, ground support capabilities, give GPs one-time support for the necessary IT enhancements and capability-building to bring them on board. So, we estimate a set up cost of over $1 billion over the next three to four years.",68,300,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00300
2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Beyond that, there will be recurrent costs.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We can illustrate this logic from a personal perspective. Earlier on, I talked about the kidney dialysis patients at NKF and how they regretted not taking preventive action earlier. If they had practised preventive care, it would have cost them very little, in terms of effort and money.

2022-10-04-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, and most importantly, we need to ensure that every Singaporean visits a dedicated family doctor or clinic.

Besides walking, if individuals engage in other activities, such as ball games, dancing, gardening or other workouts, they will also be rewarded.

But we all know that out of those who bet on the lottery every week, the vast majority would lose money and only the rare few wins something. In general, those who live unhealthily tend to end up as ""losers"", and the risk of falling ill is high. So, we should not gamble with our health and our lives.",91,323,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00323

To him, a lower-skilled doctor can only treat a person's illness, a mediocre doctor can take care of a person's health and a superior doctor would be able to improve the health of the entire nation. Sun Simiao also said that an extremely capable doctor treats illnesses before they surface, a mediocre one treats an illness that is just starting, while a lower-skilled one treats an individual's known illnesses.

Ah Ma had been ill for some years – ill with a major stroke, bedbound, could not get out of the home. She was a PG Singaporean with a PG card but because she was not mobile, bedbound, she physically could not get to the polyclinic near her home. That meant she could not access the polyclinic care without a means test.

2022-10-04-T-009,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"So, we need to look at cases like this, see if there are ways to deliver care closer to patients' homes, and even have some medically necessary consultations in patient's homes, if needed. And likewise, to see if the funding journey can be more straightforward for such home medical visits, where they are assessed to be medically necessary.",15,352,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00352
2022-10-04-T-009,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"There are also some Clementi seniors who have regular medical appointments at hospitals, needing blood tests. They are wondering if some of these medically necessary tests can be done closer to home, or on occasion, at their homes, while still receiving some level of subsidy. It saves time waiting for some blood tests that may take several hours and it saves a trip back and forth, for blood tests that need to be done a few days before the medical appointment. Because when a caregiver has to accompany a patient back and forth, the burden, the stress, the worry, does not just fall on the patient. It falls on the caregiver who may have to take time-off from work and often it is the less well-off caregivers who have less bargaining power with the employer, less able to take time-off without worrying for the safety of their jobs.",16,353,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00353
2022-10-04-T-009,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"So, for medically necessary treatments, Mr Speaker, we should look at how to bring the subsidy to the patient, if it helps prevent hospitalisations, reduce the burden of suffering, if it reduces the number of visits and the load on caregivers.",17,354,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00354
2022-10-04-T-009,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Because when subsidy is tied to a physical venue, to a place of bricks and mortar, it can become accidentally regressive because the less well-off – patients and families who are less mobile, they find it harder to get to the place of care, harder to access to the subsidy. And it is these families who also find it harder to apply for private medical transport, to foot the bill, to get to the place of care.",18,355,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00355
2022-10-04-T-009,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"So, I call upon MOH to look closely at this because if the policy intent is to provide subsidy where help is needed, then we have to keep a lookout for physical or systemic barriers.",19,356,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00356

Talking with a senior who has just been discharged from hospital after an illness, helping that senior find hope and confidence again to go back to exercising and leading a healthy lifestyle.

Given the direction of Healthier SG towards waiving cash co-payment requirements for chronic care management, I would like to call for the annual MediSave withdrawal limits for chronic disease management to be completely lifted, especially for those over 60.

Can the Minister confirm that the ""narrowing"" of the difference will be brought about only by lowering the price of drugs for patients of family doctors, and not by increasing polyclinic prices to achieve parity? Furthermore, how much can drug costs be brought down, without subsidising private GPs' profits, given that GPs also make a margin from the sale of prescription medication?",13,396,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00396

Sir, the first of the five key features of the Healthier SG plan is to mobilise a network of family doctors. ""Lynchpin"", as the Minister has just called it. The family doctor will consult, will develop a health plan, will conduct annual check-ins and help residents achieve their health goals. This, in theory, sounds good. But, in practice, most residents only see a GP when they are ill. If GPs are the first to be tapped upon, then their transition from the role of a GP, just addressing someone's immediate needs, chop-chop and go, to that of a family doctor or physician – this transition, this journey cannot be underestimated.",5,416,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00416

Would there be prerequisite skillsets and dispositions that need to be considered? Other than their intrinsic motivation to want to do good for their residents, would the financial incentive that Minister spoke about be sufficient to cover their time and their costs?",6,417,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00417

2022-10-04-T-009,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Next, on developing individual health plans. Developing health plans for enrolled residents is one thing, but following up to ensure outcomes is another. The White Paper correctly states, I quote, ""while doctors can prescribe activities, it will only work if residents take personal ownership of their health and their lifestyles, and follow through with their health plans.""

How does the Ministry intend to address the first target group who are the senior residents above 60, who may be even more rigid in their mindsets and their behaviours? Why is there little mention of upstream interventions when one is younger, such as those in schools, because that is when behaviours and mindsets are shaped?

2022-10-04-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Thus, we must look at other indicators, such as healthy life expectancy, or the proportion of life spent in poor health, that are more telling of the situation. The Government has alluded to this, attributing the rising costs of our healthcare budgets over the years partly to the increased impact of chronic disease on our population. Our population is living longer, but not necessarily more healthily. I hope that these other metrics start to form the backbone of how we measure good care outcomes.",5,439,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00439

It is because of his gentle humour, patience and smiling countenance that doctors' visits never felt stressful – whether it was for a flu infection or a routine follow-up. And his practice nurses too eventually got to know our entire family – including my two ageing grandmothers – well enough to automatically pull out our patient cards without us having to provide our registration details and to chat with us about the latest family updates.",6,440,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00440

2022-10-04-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),The current system does not allow much space or resources for the care team to be able to support a patient's health more holistically and to develop and work out a long-term approach to each patient's care. It is therefore good that we are moving towards institutionalising and formalising that important relationship between family doctors and Singaporeans.,9,443,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00443

It also must be noted that in order to deliver the objectives outlined in the White Paper, the paradigm shift in care would mean that family doctors will inevitably end up spending more time with each patient and this would mean longer hours, the number of patients being equal.",10,444,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00444

This is particularly important during the transition period while both patients and care workers are still getting to know the new approach and as we wait for the efforts of our preventive care programmes to bear fruit.

Given that we are now in the final quarter of 2022, this is an ambitious target.

Perhaps of more concern was the finding that students reported having encountered derogatory comments about the area, including doctors in GPFM having ""poor clinical competence"".",20,454,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00454
2022-10-04-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The sentiment that family doctors may not be as well remunerated compared with consultants – particularly in private practice – is also exacerbated by the high costs of setting up a private practice in the first place, when compared with the career option of a senior consultant working in a hospital. Directly addressing and removing such concerns, would be essential in meeting the aims being debated here today and I hope that these are issues that we quickly overcome, to ensure that our very best and brightest medical students and even mid-career doctors see training to be a family physician as a career choice, or even ""the"" career of choice.",21,455,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00455

2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"In contrast, when the diagnosis is done later and in a hospital setting, and he does not engage much with primary care, this could result in poorer management of diabetes and increased re-admissions. But here is the good news. The Lumos data also suggests a GP visit within one week of discharge of an unplanned re-admission can substantially reduce the risk of an unplanned hospitalisation in the five to 12 weeks following discharge.

2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"The drawbacks of our current model of a fee for service are clear. It motivates doctors to take on more and more patients, even if they do not have time, to order that extra MRI, even if it is not necessary, to prescribe the most expensive drug instead of a generic that does the job. It feeds off a very human trait – love, the love that makes us willing to try anything, spend anything, if we believe it might keep our loved ones alive. And trust me, I know how that feels.",29,582,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00582
2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"But, Mr Speaker, more expensive care is not necessarily better care. More treatment is not better care.

There are different forms – pay for performance, bundled payments, capitation and they can be used in combination, but the fundamental logic is the same – pay for quality and value rather than volume.",30,583,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00583
2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Capitation, in particular, gives healthcare providers a powerful incentive to manage total systems costs. Most capitation systems are geared to encourage providers to focus on prevention and early detection and intervention. One successful example is CMS Medicare Advantage in the US, where Medicare pays private insurers a fixed risk-adjusted payment for the total cost of care for a patient. Then, it is up to the insurer and its provider partners to figure out the best way to invest that money to provide the care. Insurers, such as Humana, have built their own or partnered provider networks to help them create more value-based models.",31,584,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00584

2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"This holistic approach often drives new insights and innovation. So, if the patient needs a surgery to be healthy, they will make the referral. If he needs food delivered to him to make sure he eats healthy, that is what they do. Or if it takes a house visit to make sure that the home does not have hazards – a stray rug or slippery tiles that could cause him to trip and fall, that is what they do. Or if they think the most meaningful thing is to have someone put their arm around him to be comfortable with his life situation, that is what they do – and they are achieving good outcomes.",33,586,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00586

2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"These successful models point to a few prerequisites for capitation to be truly value-based. It needs to be organised around defined patient groups and population segments, adjusted for risk, and linked to quality thresholds or improvement in health outcomes. Otherwise, capitation could create incentives for ""cherry-picking"" of healthier patients or for limiting access to required care or what we call ""rationing"" behaviour.",35,588,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00588
2022-10-04-T-009,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"To that end, can the Minister clarify the capitation model envisioned under Healthier SG, including how will the payments be risk adjusted based on patient profiles in the cluster? Will there be bonus payments for achieving better health outcomes? How will health outcomes be shared across the delivery value chain to encourage people to work together? How much autonomy will be given to the clusters and clinical teams to do what they believe is right to deliver better care, informed by care protocols and outcomes? Can there be participation payments for tracking and reporting health outcomes? How will adjustments be made at the backend when someone uses healthcare services outside his or her own cluster?",36,589,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00589

I think I am just making a general point that we have seen in multiple studies, that sometimes target-setting too early when you do not actually have a good base behind it can create a lot of perverse target-setting. I am not saying that hospitals will do it, not saying that doctors will do it, but I do not think we need to take that risk and instead focus on the measurement, identifying the right ones in the first place, measuring, and then also making sure that we keep doing better and better in those KPIs.",1,609,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00609

A paradigm shift because most of us, most of the patients, only when they are ill, will they see a doctor. If you are not ill, you should not see a doctor at all. Most of the doctors will only see patients when they are ill. If the patients are well, they do not see the patients. So, it is very, very different. I am not sure if we should even call them patients in the first place because now, they are not ill at all. So, it is a complete paradigm shift.

It is a bit too late. If you want to prevent dementia, you should encourage them to start walking at 40 years old. If you walk 4,000 steps a day, it reduces your risk by 20%. If you walk 10,000 steps a day, it halves your risks straightaway.

Last December, I had a health scare and I conceded that at 43 years old, I just could not catch up with my children. I consulted a doctor friend and after analysing the results, he assured me that I was just too exhausted but highlighted that it is time I put my sports science knowledge into practice.",24,735,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00735
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"So, I started the New Year with a simple goal of being more active, having a healthier lifestyle. To shift my BMI category from overweight to something more acceptable and lowering my body fat percentage from 25% to 20%. This means shedding about 10 kilogrammes off my deceivingly ""okay-looking"" frame. I am glad to share that I have met the objectives, but there are a few lessons learnt.",25,736,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00736
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"The first lesson is looking okay or feeling okay, does not mean one is healthy. Thus, the importance of screening cannot be underestimated. It not only gives me a peace of mind knowing the results of my screening, but nudged me towards preventive health too. My initial commitment to physical exercise and increased physical activity then manifested into other aspects of health. For example, I became more conscious of nutrition, cutting down on salt and sugar and eating more vegetables. I also began to be conscious of my overall well-being, like cutting down on screen time and making sure I have enough sleep.",26,737,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00737
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"So, lesson number two is health is not just about physical health. A holistic, balanced, sustainable approach to self-care, based on the numerous dimensions of health and wellness, is important – like mental, social and spiritual health.",27,738,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00738
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Notably, the people around me became the catalyst and motivation. Family members, friends, colleagues and even my grassroots leaders, were more receptive to my healthier lifestyle. For example, simple things like a healthier food spread, more family activities at the park and shorter meetings in the evenings, makes a lot of difference to our health. These allow me to maintain my newfound healthy habits and encourage others to pick up healthier habits too.",28,739,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00739
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"So, lesson number three – it is always better together. I hope that MOH and community partners like PA plan activities for all the communities – activities that revolve around families. Studies have shown the elderly who stay connected to the family and participate in regular recreational physical activities benefit from a longer life expectancy, better immune system and better mental health.",29,740,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00740
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Madam, preventive health is a commitment that each of us must make, but it is often easier said than done. In this regard, an individual's commitment and the whole community must move towards a healthy lifestyle and make preventive health happen.",30,741,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00741
2022-10-04-T-009,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"The Government alone cannot make it happen. However, I do hope that the plans laid in place will nudge and ease Singaporeans to control and begin a healthier lifestyle. Notwithstanding my concerns shared earlier, I support the Motion.",31,742,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00742

2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"""For a nation to truly prosper, its citizens must have good health. Those who enjoy good physical and mental health, report high levels of well-being. An effective health infrastructure is critical for sustaining per capita income. Poor health keeps people from fulfilling their potential."" That was a quote by Baroness Philippa Stroud, CEO of Legatum Institute, a thinktank in London. Legatum Institute ranked Singapore number two in the world for the Health Pillar in their Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI) 2021.",2,745,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00745
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning healthcare system requires a steady financing mechanism, a properly trained and adequately paid workforce, well-maintained facilities and access to reliable information to base decisions on. The WHO's global study assesses healthcare systems around the world and Singapore was ranked sixth in the world, and the highest rank for countries outside of Europe.",3,746,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00746
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"And, as reflected in Figure 1 in the White Paper, Singapore has been able to achieve good health outcomes, improving our healthcare system, without incurring substantially higher levels of healthcare expenditure. It is not by chance that Singapore has been able to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic with relatively low deaths. How we have emerged from COVID-19 reflects the resilience of our healthcare system, of our institutions and most of all, of our Government and our people. Kudos especially to the generations of healthcare professionals and policy-makers who have strategically enabled us to more than survive COVID-19, and to emerge from COVID-19 stronger together.",4,747,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00747
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The Healthier SG White Paper, which is being debated in the House today, is timely. Singapore is faced with a rapidly ageing population, and we can expect, therefore, an increase in the proportion of people living with diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases.",5,748,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00748
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"As the saying goes, ""Prevention is always better than cure."" We need to shift our emphasis from reactively caring for those who fall seriously ill, to proactively preventing individuals from falling ill. Therefore, health screening, a healthy lifestyle and education are the key pillars to disease prevention. We got to add to that discipline.",6,749,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00749
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"At the same time, we need to sharpen our focus on the value of care, recognising that there is a cost to care. Dr Brent James, a renowned clinician and Doctor of Medicine who was the Chief Quality Officer for over 30 years at Intermountain Healthcare and a senior advisor with Health Catalyst as well as co-author of a book, ""To Err is Human"", suggests that Value of Care = [Clinical Outcome + Patient Experience] divided by cost. Prevention and going upstream has been proven to be the best way to improve clinical outcome.",7,750,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00750
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The community also plays a part in the reshaping of our healthcare model toward one that involves every resident and not just when they become a patient. Allow me to share two initiatives where I personally witnessed the community in action, and the impact on the health and well-being of the seniors as well as the volunteers.",8,751,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00751

During COVID-19, SHARE A POT® went online and did its part to help seniors to stay connected. These kinds of initiatives can become a part of the Healthier SG community partnership.",10,753,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00753
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),I applaud Healthier SG for the comprehensive holistic approach that it has taken. There is a lot to be done but we will need the whole of Singapore to be committed to act for a healthier Singapore. Continued dialogue with all stakeholders to clarify issues and collaborate on solutions as we take this forward will be imperative.,11,754,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00754
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"For the rest of my speech, I will cover three areas.",12,755,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00755
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"First, going upstream with resident and family physician relationship. For example, at Intermountain, they incentivise the Primary Care Network to keep people out of hospitals as much as possible. For their diabetic population, they invested additional 4% of their budget in this group and achieved a decrease in hospital admits by 22% and a decrease of 21% for other avoidable visits and admissions, resulting in overall improvement in value of care and reducing overall costs over time. So, prevention is certainly better than cure.",13,756,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00756
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Healthier SG is enlisting the primary care providers to play the central role in this healthcare model. This will cement the place of family medicine in delivering holistic and coordinated healthcare to all patients, reduce doctor and clinic hopping and have the potential to ultimately improve rationalisation of specialist care by public hospitals.",14,757,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00757
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Everyone I have spoken with agrees that this is certainly a step in the right direction, but cautions that as in all things, the devil is in the details. How to implement and to implement it right from the start is the big question. Here are some of the questions which we hope MOH can clarify.",15,758,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00758
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"While it is good for a patient to come under a fixed doctor or clinic, it may not always translate in practice. For example, patients seen at polyclinics often do not get to see the same doctor at every visit. Likewise, some GP groups employ locum doctors. Can MOH clarify if the intended enrolment is with a GP practice/clinic or is it with a named doctor?",16,759,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00759
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Can a resident be enrolled with more than one GP so that there is a second opinion or a back-up doctor in case the enrolled doctor is on vacation or at a conference? How does the enrolment work for the family paediatrician, the family dental surgeon, the eye doctor and others? By the way, will health screening include regular eye screening and dental screening?",17,760,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00760
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),What happens to the residents who do not enrol? How will it work for residents with company provided or insurance provided panel of doctors? Can the employees consider the GP clinics of the healthcare partners as their enrolled GP?,18,761,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00761
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Phased approach is the pragmatic way to implement. I am above 60, and so am in the category – but after listening to hon Members speak about it, I do hope that MOH can consider enrolling the students in Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and the National Service (NS) groups as well as reduce the starting age to 40, because usually it is the 40-something who will bring the 70-something to the doctor. So, I think it is good also for research – comparing the different groups, how they adopt and enrol themselves into such a programme.",19,762,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00762
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Next, the plan to use technology to help implement this programme is laudable and should be explored. I love the idea of using the HealthHub app as a digital reminder to patients. To close the loop, there can be digital reminders in-built into the electronic medical record system, which prompts the doctor to check on the progress of the healthcare plan and ensure timely implementation. To take it one step further, appointments with relevant care team members can also be considered to be implemented online.",20,763,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00763
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Therefore, the IT system, the health communications network and the National Electronic Health Records system are critical for the successful implementation of this initiative. MOH has done very well as it is in this space but will need to continue to invest as more still needs to be done to ensure system up-time, efficient sharing and update of the patient's health records while ensuring data is secure and personal data duly protected.",21,764,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00764
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"There will also be a need for trained doctors, nurses and staff to engage, educate and support the patients in the enrolment and transition journey. What help and support will MOH provide to help the GPs and clinics transition to the level of digital that will enable them to perform their role in this healthcare model?",22,765,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00765
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"According to Dr David M Eddy, the father of evidence-based medicine, it is now well studied and clear that ""complexity of modern medicine exceeds the capacity of the unaided expert mind. Solo reliance on the craft of medicine is scientifically untenable.""",23,766,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00766
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"It has been found that the best way forward is to develop evidence-based best practice protocol, blend it into clinical workflow, embed data systems to track protocol variations and strongly advocate that clinicians apply the protocol but subject the protocol to continuous improvement based on patient need, and thereby improving the protocol in a continuous loop applying Deming's Lean Six Sigma principles. Clinicians globally have found this approach to improve clinical quality and drive better clinical outcomes over time.",24,767,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00767
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),I read from the White Paper that our Singapore medical and clinical professionals are exploring such best practice methodologies and I applaud it.,25,768,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00768
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Let me speak briefly for the digital naive, the vulnerable elders and the foreigners. In spite of the best efforts of the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), GovTech and their volunteers, there is still a large group of seniors who may not be digitally savvy. How will MOH onboard this segment of citizens who are digitally naive and who are likely to be from the lower-income households? Will we consider similar initiative like they did in Japan where the neighbourhood postman becomes the point of contact for this group of vulnerable seniors?",26,769,2022-10-04-T-009-S-00769
2022-10-04-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"For vulnerable elders, will home care and support for end-of-life be part of this programme?

2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Today, we are debating a new health and healthcare strategy for Singapore, laid out in the White Paper on Healthier SG.",2,779,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00779
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),The last time MOH published a White Paper was 30 years ago. That paper was on affordable health care and it was a landmark paper that went on to define the development of our healthcare system over the last 30 years.,3,780,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00780
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Thirty years on, we have this White Paper on Healthier SG. And I believe it will be no less of a landmark paper, providing an additional strategy – a strategy reboot – for a vastly different population with very different needs and against the backdrop of a Government healthcare budget that has increased many times in the last 10 years.",4,781,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00781
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),This White Paper shows how urgent and important our challenge of bending the healthcare cost curve is. I stand in support of the Motion. I had two key considerations in mind as I prepared this speech.,5,782,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00782
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"First, because the challenge before us is so important and so urgent, we must take a thorough and critical look at every piece of the Healthier SG strategy and leave no stone unturned. In this regard, I will make quite a number of points in my speech. But second, I will focus only on the strategy – and the key strategic pieces – and set aside for now questions that are of a more operational nature, even if there are a number of these.",6,783,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00783
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"With this preamble, let me lay out my views on the White Paper on Healthier SG.",7,784,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00784
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"First, Healthier SG must be inclusive because it goes to the heart of our social compact, and our social compact must, in turn, be for all Singaporeans. On this point, I have three key questions.",8,785,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00785
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"How do we ensure Healthier SG is inclusive socio-economically? We know the lower-income segment has poorer health outcomes and a lower propensity for health-seeking behaviours for various reasons. Therefore, I wished the White Paper had included specific mention of how we plan to support our lower-income segment through additional, differentiated measures to remove the particular barriers to health-seeking behaviours that this segment faces.",9,786,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00786
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"For example, because travelling distance may be an especially salient barrier for this segment, do we need to be particularly deliberate in ensuring proximity of family doctors in both GP clinics and polyclinics to our rental communities?",10,787,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00787
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"How can we improve seemingly basic things like nutrition, sleep and smoking cessation through targeted interventions for this segment because these things may not be basic for them?",11,788,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00788
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"How can we help this segment find time and cognitive bandwidth to exercise, when time and cognitive bandwidth may be particularly scarce for this group?",12,789,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00789
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Because the social needs of this segment are especially high, how can we be particularly deliberate in enabling GPs to work with community partners to address such social needs?",13,790,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00790
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),How can we better bring Social Service Offices and social service agencies into the framework of healthcare clusters and Primary Care Networks so that we strengthen and tighten the nexus between social services and health for the low income? Who will have primary responsibility to pull all the assets together to wrap around the enrolled person?,14,791,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00791
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),I wish the White Paper had provided some insights to these questions.,15,792,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00792
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The second question that I have is how do we ensure Healthier SG is inclusive digitally? The Healthy 365 app will be the ""digital front door"" for citizens to enrol with a family doctor and Healthy 365 will also be the ""digital front door"" for capturing individual behaviour, for tracking progress and for generating healthpoints in exchange for rewards.",16,793,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00793
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),But we know that a number of seniors have dropped out of exercise groups when these groups went onto Healthy 365 for the sign-up and bidding of slots. They dropped out because they did not know how to do this on Healthy 365.,17,794,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00794
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Seniors have also given lots of feedback about polyclinics and their recent shift towards more and more of an appointment-based system in lieu of walk-ins. Seniors wonder how they go about booking polyclinic appointments online or on mobile? If they call the hotline, what number should they call? How long do they have to wait for their calls to be answered? A ""digital front door"" in Healthier SG can well become a ""digital gate"" for some and we have to avoid that.",18,795,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00795
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The White Paper further mentions HealthHub as the second ""digital front door"" for every individual's health action plan. But each of the three healthcare clusters also has its own app – its own ""digital front door"". So, put together, these could add convenience to users but they may also confuse them.",19,796,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00796
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The point is  while digital is essential and we must have digital channels, we have to also preserve traditional touchpoints. In other words, we must provide optionality in the key touchpoints of Healthier SG. Optionality by providing both traditional and digital options rather than substituting the traditional with the digital. We need optionality as a core design principle of key Healthier SG touchpoints.",20,797,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00797
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The third question I have is, how do we ensure Healthier SG is Inclusive for All Healthcare Professionals? I did a word count. The word ""doctor"" was mentioned more than 160 times in the White Paper, unsurprisingly. Compared to ""nurse"" and ""nursing"", which were mentioned 22 times, ""pharmacist"" was mentioned six times and ""allied health"", seven times. So, the doctor appears overwhelmingly to be the centre of gravity in the Healthier SG strategy, but what about the roles of a nurse, a pharmacist and an allied health professional?",21,798,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00798
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Is there room for more equal roles, more co-leadership to shape preventive care in the community? Because, let us pin the flag squarely on the mast. The focus of Healthier SG is chronic diseases. Prevent chronic disease onset in the first instance and if disease is inevitable, manage these diseases well. So, it is not complex medicine per se, but medicine that is person-centred, relationship-driven and certainly high-value. And in this respect, nurses are very good at titrating medication and at engaging, motivating and cajoling. These are key activities in preventing chronic diseases and in managing chronic diseases, that nurses can be very good at.",22,799,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00799
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And in comparison, what is more exclusive to doctors is the gestalt to diagnose diseases and to provide prognoses of disease trajectories. So, I wish we had a fuller articulation of the vision for nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals, including medical social workers, in the overall Healthier SG strategy – all practicing at the top of their respective licenses in the community, alongside doctors, to prevent and manage chronic diseases across our population.",23,800,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00800
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And I think we also need a mindset shift in our population, from a doctor-centric view to one that respects all healthcare professionals including nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals, and what they can do.",24,801,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00801
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"In summary, my first broad point  our Healthier SG strategy needs to be inclusive socio-economically, inclusive digitally and inclusive for all healthcare professionals.",25,802,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00802
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"My second broad point is that manpower planning will be key in Healthier SG. The most natural question in this regard is how many family doctors, nurses and so on, would we need to fully realise the strategy, but I prefer to leave this to MOH's COS debate next year. I think that would be the best time to discuss manpower numbers.",26,803,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00803
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Today, I would like to raise some other points about manpower planning.",27,804,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00804
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"First, for the public healthcare sector, we need stability to become a key principle in manpower planning. Family doctors and physicians in our public polyclinics will take on a significant portion of the Healthier SG workload even as we enable GPs to step up and to do more. So, within the polyclinics, I would like to ask what happens to enrolment arrangements when family doctors and physicians within these polyclinics move, get rotated or cross-deployed, as they routinely do. Do patients move with the doctors? Fundamentally, are Singaporeans going to be enrolled to a polyclinic or to a particular doctor within the polyclinic?",28,805,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00805
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),May I boldly suggest that we need less rotation and more stability in our manpower planning for all polyclinics across all three healthcare clusters in order for Healthier SG to work as it should?,29,806,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00806
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"On a related note, may I suggest even more boldly, that clinical manpower recruitment, posting and deployment in general across our three healthcare clusters, should be centralised at the Ministry level going forward? Currently, the healthcare clusters have principal responsibility for this strategic manpower function. Taking this responsibility off the clusters and moving it to the Ministry level will ensure a coherent manpower planning strategy nationwide in support of national desired outcomes, and as importantly, this would free up strategic bandwidth within the clusters for them to step up to their very important new roles and responsibilities as regional health managers under Healthier SG.",30,807,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00807
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Besides clinical manpower planning, we would need equally robust manpower planning for our cybersecurity and healthcare IT talent. As the White Paper noted and many Members have noted, IT is a critical enabler and quite often a pain point. But the competition for tech talent has never been more intense and will probably intensify further. So, how does the Ministry plan to manage the competition and secure the healthcare IT and cybersecurity talent it needs to deliver on Healthier SG?",31,808,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00808
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"We need to get this right, because this is about securing public trust in the protection of their healthcare data, and it is also about securing the trust of professional users in the usability and inter-operability of our healthcare IT systems.",32,809,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00809
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"In summary, my second broad point about manpower planning for Healthier SG  we need this to enhance clinical manpower stability in polyclinics, we need to free up strategic bandwidth for healthcare clusters and we need to secure critical IT talent.",33,810,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00810
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"My third broad point is  let us remember to integrate downstream even as we look to integrate upstream. It is timely and apt that Healthier SG emphasises upstream interventions, primary care, preventive care, collaboration between GPs and community partners to promote health. All this is good, but we also need to pay an equal amount of attention to integrating much more downstream. In other words, strengthening the integration between GPs and specialists that are based largely in our hospitals.",34,811,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00811
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"GPs have spoken of the need to become more equal partners in care, vis-à-vis their specialist counterparts. GPs want to feel that after a referral is made to a specialist in a hospital, there is tight two-way communication and the loop is closed, and GPs do not feel like they are losing their patients to the system, and in the system. Of course, details about such integration between GPs and specialists ought to be worked out by the healthcare clusters but I wished the White Paper had made a stronger mention of our larger, strategic intent in this regard.",35,812,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00812
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"For Healthier SG to really tackle chronic diseases across our population, we need to integrate much more, both upstream and downstream, across the health and healthcare value chain and address all archetypes, including those with more advanced diseases and requiring more specialised care.",36,813,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00813
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"My fourth broad point  on healthcare financing, our reforms can go further to truly drive integration. Ideally, capitation funding to GPs should flow through the healthcare clusters rather than from MOH, as is currently proposed in the White Paper. Capitation funding to GPs through the clusters will drive fuller integrations between GPs and the clusters as regional health managers. We should aspire to – as many Members have mentioned – the UK model for example, where GPs can eventually refer patients for direct admission to a hospital within a healthcare cluster, without the need to go through an Emergency Department, for clinically appropriate cases.",37,814,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00814
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"I hope as we progress in this multi-year Healthier SG journey, we will keep pushing the boundaries on healthcare financing as a key lever to drive integration and what is currently described in the White Paper will not be become our eventual end-state.",38,815,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00815
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"My last broad point on Healthier SG  in certain aspects of the strategy, let us avoid optimising at the margins, only to blunt the tip of the spear. What do I mean? The Motion before us today has only three limbs and community-based programmes are one of the limbs. In fact, the White Paper also emphasised that, ""good health is sustained through everyday choices and habits, which take place outside healthcare facilities"" – outside the clinic. So, community-based, health-promoting programmes are a centre of gravity of Healthier SG.",39,816,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00816
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"These programmes in the community are what I would call ""the tip of our Healthier SG spear"" and as Minister mentioned in his opening speech, they occupy that space and the time between the visits to the clinic, to the GP, so they are really important. They are the tip of our spear and we must keep it sharp. Keeping it sharp means amongst other things, ensuring that there is adequate funding to this part of the strategy, and as importantly, we need to rethink how we measure effectiveness and efficiency of such funding.",40,817,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00817
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"For example, exercise groups by HPB had emerged with a vengeance since we opened up and residents have really welcomed this. But recently, there has been concerns amongst residents that some of the exercise groups by HPB could be cut or consolidated away because they are not hitting and maintaining a certain attendance rate. If the purpose of these exercise groups is simply community programming, then I would agree with this approach because we need to be prudent.",41,818,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00818
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"But if such community exercise programmes are so important in Healthier SG, if these programmes are the tip of our Healthier SG spear, then we need a different approach. We need to have K-pop classes available in the mornings and evenings on weekdays and on weekends. We need to have Zumba and Stretch Band and HIIT classes equally available, mornings or evenings, weekdays or weekends.",42,819,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00819
2022-10-04-T-011,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"We need each and every local community to be abuzz and completely teeming with community exercise groups and health promoting activities catering to the entire range of needs and lifestyles within the community. This will really bring Healthier SG alive in the community and send a strong signal to residents that we want them on board, even if this may mean some redundancy or unused capacity at the margins.",43,820,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00820

Member Ms Hazel Poa suggested taxing unhealthy food to subsidise healthy food. And I would just like to ask her for clarifications about her specific ideas for taxing unhealthy food and in the larger spirit of Healthier SG, having heard the essence of the strategy, whether she feels that, an intervention like taxing unhealthy food would cohere with the overall spirit of the strategy and is still a good idea.",2,823,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00823

While many may be aware of the workplace grievances handled and social benefits provided by our NTUC social enterprises and affiliated merchants, unions do so much more than that. Of the many cases that unions handle, only about 10% are on workplace grievances. Hence, we need to provide unique, value-added services to the remaining 90% of our members, one of which is to provide support and subsidies for our members in terms of health and wellness.",4,832,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00832

2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I will now touch on the ground sentiment from residents I have interacted with. With regard to the national enrollment programme, it was stated that Singaporeans will be allowed up to four changes in the initial enrollment period but it was unclear how long the enrollment period would be. Furthermore, would there be a need for Singaporeans to indicate a reason for wanting to switch clinics?",8,864,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00864
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Given the increasing levels of tech literacy, Singaporeans are also turning to virtual doctor appointments and companies are offering such services as part of their medical benefits. Would the Government consider this group of GPs in terms of medication subsidy and capitation funding?",9,865,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00865
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Whether it is changing GPs or being able to access virtual clinician services, it will be very important for this programme to allow Singaporeans to make choices at key life stages.",10,866,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00866
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Indeed, while the GP would be the critical first touchpoint in this relationship, it would be ideal for individual Singaporeans to have a fitness coach who can journey with him or her on a regular basis. A little exercise goes a long way and the new Singapore National Physical Activity Guidelines launched by national bodies Sport Singapore and the Health Promotion Board rationalise official guidance towards healthy activity.",11,867,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00867
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Having access to fitness coaches would allow for a deeper collaboration between MOH with SportsSG, HPB and People's Association, especially with the vast range of community fitness centres that the Government has invested in for Singaporeans over the years.",12,868,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00868
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"By understanding that every Singaporean will need a fitness coach or ambassador or advisor nearer to where he or she lives to execute this preventive health plan, we keep our communities close to our Singaporeans. Much like the relationship between a resident and a GP is a personal one that takes into account individual preferences, so will the relationship be with a fitness coach.",13,869,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00869
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To provide Singaporeans with greater choices, would MOH look into collaborating with private fitness service providers? As these service providers are all across the island in different fitness centres and gyms, they are well-placed to provide community care. MOH could also consider engaging self-employed persons (SEPs) with domain expertise as Healthier SG ambassadors and health coaches.",14,870,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00870
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Such approaches will, in turn, encourage diversity of offerings to cater to different individuals and tap on expertise and knowledge in the private sector. It would be a missed opportunity if we do not harness the choice private sector and self-employed individuals provide to Singaporeans.",15,871,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00871
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),This will keep Healthier SG relevant to our citizens' preferences and also enable new innovative services like digital clinician services to participate.,16,872,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00872
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At the systems level, designing this programme to have high inter-operability with innovative delivery models will enable Healthier SG to tap on the private sector's ability to discover leaner and effective models of preventive healthcare. This will ensure longer-term success, especially with the backdrop of manpower constraints and rising costs.",17,873,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00873

2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As shared, employers are providing employees with medical care plans. Healthier SG's proactive, preventive approach needs to harmonise with employers. The strong support of the Singapore Business Federation and the Singapore National Employers Federation will be needed to help companies to remodel corporate health plans with this new approach.",19,875,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00875
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One question for clarification will be how the Ministry intends to work with employers in assisting their employees to enrol in family doctor national enrolment programmes. Many Singaporeans rely on the provision of medical benefits from their employers and are restricted to a fixed panel of doctors. Also, in some cases, such services are provided by corporatised clinics where doctors are less rooted to a specific clinic or location. Another added complication is when an employer changes healthcare providers or when an employee moves to a new company.",20,876,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00876
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While Singaporeans can choose to see the panel doctors for episodic care despite enrolling in the national programme, it derails from the core idea of keeping to one primary care doctor, limiting the true benefit of having a dedicated family doctor.",21,877,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00877
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),The area of interest of Singaporeans will be the co-payment or full payment by their employers under their existing employment contracts. Employers need to embrace Healthier SG so that every Singaporean feels assured that this is in line with their personal healthcare journey.,22,878,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00878
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This is all part of an evolving workplace environment and, as such, MOM needs to work very closely with MOH for this initiative.",23,879,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00879
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),Another key ecosystem partner in the provision of healthcare is insurers. MOH and the monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) should encourage the Life Insurance Association to find sustainable ways to integrate this to an individual's MediSave-related policies.,24,880,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00880
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Such preventive efforts need to be rewarded and if our insurance actuaries can understand the percentage of population making serious efforts to live better, their calculations of risks need to take this into consideration. For example, those with committed healthier plans should not be paying as much when premiums increase with age. Such co-related pricing will make our Integrated Plans relevant and useful. This would provide another incentive for individuals to take charge of their preventive health plan.",25,881,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00881
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the business model enabling the provision of healthcare services is still largely based on reactive care. As we take the bold step to shift the model to one of preventive care, we will need to engage various aspects of society, including employers and insurers, to recalibrate various cost calculations and incentives.",26,882,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00882
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have touched on two main sections in my speech.",27,883,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00883
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"First, on the micro level, let us place individual Singaporeans first in this journey by providing virtual doctors and fitness coaches by tapping on the private sector for more options.",28,884,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00884
2022-10-04-T-011,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Second, at the macro level, let us engage employers and insurers in recalibrating benefits, costs and incentivise them to better align with our model. The easier we make this to follow, the more we can guide Singaporeans to a society where we can all keep costs sustainable, maintain a comfortable standard of living and, most importantly, age well in the decades to come.",29,885,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00885

2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, I give apples to Jalan Kayu residents at every house visit from the start of this year.

2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"In my COS speech in March, I spoke about my concern for the increased prevalence of chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol in our population, not just amongst our seniors but also in some of our younger people.",3,889,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00889
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),I recognise that our national Budget for healthcare will inevitably have to increase in order to create better health and quality of life outcomes for our people. But I also suggested to manage the workload on our healthcare professionals by empowering Singaporeans to take more ownership of our own health and participate whenever possible with our healthcare professionals on our treatment or health plans.,4,890,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00890
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I thus read the Healthier SG White Paper with great delight, that we are, indeed, embarking as a nation towards a much healthier way of living, with stronger emphasis on preventive care, building relationships and trust with our family doctors to maintain our health, supported by each of our own community, right in our neighbourhood. This is a transformative healthcare policy, in my view.",5,891,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00891

2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, I would like to know how MOH will be tracking and reporting the usage of the enhanced subsidies provided under Healthier SG to encourage Singaporeans to adopt more preventive health behaviours. The White Paper outlined MOH's plan to fully subsidise nationally recommended vaccinations and screenings as well as an onboarding health consultation with their chosen family doctors upon enrolment.",9,895,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00895
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),I would like to clarify what types of vaccinations and screenings will be fully subsidised. Are they those that are under the existing Screen for Life programme or will there be more added under Healthier SG? What is the participation rate for Screen for Life for Singaporeans above 50 years old currently? And what improvement does MOH aim to achieve under Healthier SG?,10,896,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00896
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"From my Meet-the-People (MPS) experience, whenever I asked my residents in need about their awareness of Screen for Life programme, I will usually draw a blank look. For the handful who may be aware, they would admit to me their fears of finding out illnesses that will cost them more to treat and affect their jobs.",11,897,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00897
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I believe for preventive health behaviours to improve significantly in Singapore, MOH must invest more in creating the right awareness and assurance of benefits of preventive health screening and a follow-through care that Singaporeans can expect. This should be done in more mass media and vernacular languages, including even some dialects, to correct the misinformation that screenings will lead to more problems.",12,898,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00898
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, I would like to propose strengthening the community participatory approach so that our busy family doctors, whether they are practising in the GP clinics or polyclinics, would know and have quick ways of connecting with their community, sports and social service counterparts when they see patients that need support beyond medical treatments.",13,899,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00899
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"The White Paper proposed to rally a group of community care partners to support residents in leading healthier lives. The White Paper mentioned the People's Association (PA), SportsSG and Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)'s Silver Generation Office (SGO) to help organise healthy living programmes for residents. It also mentioned plans to tap on the eldercare centres to serve as the community care connectors for seniors, to help them follow through the recommended lifestyle interventions prescribed by their family doctors.",14,900,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00900
2022-10-04-T-011,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Although I am fully supportive of this approach after speaking with a few GPs in my Jalan Kayu constituency since the release of the White Paper, I noted their concerns on the bandwidth to activate such community partnership to care for their patients who are my residents. There were also questions on seniors who are living in the private estates, such as those who are living in the Seletar Hills East and Jalan Kayu private estates where some of my older residents live. The existing eldercare centres are usually located nearer to rental blocks of each constituency. I would like to ask how MOH will also support the social prescriptions by family doctors for the senior residents living further from eldercare centres, including those living in the private estates.",15,901,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00901

2022-10-04-T-011,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Another question is regarding the additional administrative and IT set-up and maintenance requirements necessary for this scheme. The White Paper states that in the initial phase, the Ministry will provide a one-off IT support grant. Going forward, inputting data and maintaining the IT system in a clinic will need more manpower and IT knowledge, particularly to ensure a high level of cybersecurity. While MOH has stated that it will support the GPs in this aspect, what will happen if a patient's preferred GP chooses not to join the network due to the clinic's constraints?",6,929,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00929

2022-10-04-T-011,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Some residents are also concerned that more costs for the GPs will be involved and they worry as a result, the medical costs will be higher for residents who see GPs under this Healthier SG initiative.

2022-10-04-T-011,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I applaud the decision to narrow the difference in drug subsidies across polyclinics and private clinics through a combination of enhanced drug subsidies and drug price limits. However, there may be some non-generic drugs which will continue to be priced above the limits. Will patients be given a choice to opt for such drugs via personal top-ups and MOH to provide greater subsidies because these drugs work well for them?",9,932,2022-10-04-T-011-S-00932

Our domestic interest rates are likely to increase further in tandem with global interest rates as rates here are largely market determined. For example, US policy rates have been raised to fight inflation by a total of 3% in less than six months, as compared to an almost 0% interest rate for the large part of 2009 to 2021. The US Federal Reserve System (the Fed) officials have indicated that interest rates may continue to rise and hit close to 4.6% in 2023. Some market participants are even forecasting it to reach 5%. In fact, there are no stated upper limits to what the Fed can hike rates to, to achieve their inflation mandate.

Singaporeans and Singaporean households will need to adjust to the new normal and plan their borrowings and expenditures accordingly.

2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I am also heartened by recent Department of Statistics data and expert assessments that households will be able to weather higher interest rates and a potential economic recession given their financial positions as at the 2nd quarter of 2022, as their household assets-to-liabilities ratio remains healthy.

Many Singaporean families have existing borrowings to finance big-ticket items like their mortgages, cars and education, and many of them have carefully budgeted, saved and invested to achieve their financial objectives, although based on the old normal.

The notices are quite brief, stating not much more beyond the new rate percentage.",8,985,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00985

I have had residents emailing to meet me physically, to share with me their financial issues with servicing loans, where I realised that they did not understand that their payments paid off the interest first and the principal later. They thought the lender had cheated them. In this sort of backdrop, we must ensure that the banks and other institutions that provide loans of all kinds, including the non-bank financial institutions and authorised money lenders and so on, proactively clarify the impact to their borrowers. While there are various mortgage loan calculators offered by some banks and other websites on the Internet, not everyone may know of them or how to use them.",9,986,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00986
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One simple solution would be to shift this task to the banks, financial and other lending institutions, who are sophisticated enough to model the practical effects relatively easily. While there may be certain uncertainties that may affect the precise impact of an interest rate rise on a particular borrower, the financial institutions can provide an indicative range to give the borrower an idea. This boils down to the basic principle of balancing caveat emptor for the investor/customer versus whether banks owe a social duty of care to more than just the average bank customer. Some of the less sophisticated retail investors and retail bank customers might not have the same level of savviness as the ""average median investor"".",10,987,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00987
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),This should not be unfamiliar to the financial sector. Insurance agents are already required to provide the benefits illustration in an endowment policy proposal based on different scenarios of investment rates of return. Financial institutions offering credit cards or mortgages are required by MAS to provide projections of instalment payments under different scenarios. They are all similarly aimed at giving the end-consumer an easy-to-understand picture of the financial calculations.,11,988,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00988
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This will also mean that the financial institutions may be able to pre-empt when homebuyers might encounter issues servicing higher home loans if their incomes and savings rates have become insufficient. In such cases, I hope the Government or relevant agencies work with the financial institutions to allow for longer-term mortgage tenures to accommodate homebuyers who struggle to pay higher instalments? Or at the very least be more alert now about such cases and offer some flexibility in the current environment as a baseline.",12,989,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00989

The fixed interest rate on HDB loans was certainly less attractive just months ago, when bank loan rates were as low as 1.15% to 1.5%.

2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With the present global interest rate hikes set to continue, they will now be locked into a higher rate than the HDB rate which they were trying to find a lower alternative for. While I understand that the policy is that homeowners who opt for, or refinance using bank loans can no longer take up a HDB loan, perhaps the HDB can consider allowing eligible households to make a one-time transfer back to HDB loans? While I am mindful that it may have some backend implications for the banks, a refinancing sort of mechanism, if one is eligible, could be one possible approach.",15,992,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00992
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The HDB loan rate is pegged at 0.1% above the prevailing Central Provident Fund (CPF) Ordinary Account (OA) interest rate, and HDB and CPF have recently confirmed that the applicable rates will remain unchanged until the end of this year.",16,993,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00993
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I understand that the standing policy is for the OA interest rate to be reviewed every three months. Given the impact of changes in rates on borrowers' finances in the medium-term, it would be helpful if the Government or HDB is able to provide HDB borrowers more advanced guidance on potential rate changes, beyond three months. This will allow new and existing homeowners to make a more certain choice on how they finance their home, to better prepare them amidst this new normal of interest rate levels that we may be entering. On balance, the information provided will help household decisions but the impact of the extent in which this becomes a de facto forward guidance on the rates will need to be considered in totality.",17,994,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00994
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We must also ensure that Singapore is prepared in the extraordinary event where home loan rates rise sharply, such as if the US Fed raises their rates to above 5%. The US mortgage rates have already hit 6% for the first time since 2008. Does the Government have any contingency plans in place? Will MAS consider implementing temporary measures, such as rate ceilings to ensure that rates do not spiral out of control and become unaffordable? For example, there are already maximum annual percentage interest rates on credit card and pawn loans. Many countries around the world, including our neighbours Indonesia and Malaysia, have forms of subsidised housing loans targeted at lower-income citizens, and this is also an interim policy measure that is worth considering for vulnerable groups not captured by the concessionary HDB loan.",18,995,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00995
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Besides housing, education is another key reason for Singaporeans' borrowing. There has always been a strong policy reason to ensure that our students who are trying to secure a good education are not saddled with heavy debt before they enter the workforce. For example, the Ministry of Education (MOE) Study Loan allows low-income households to obtain loans that are interest-free for a limited or entire duration of the loan. The CPF Education Loan Scheme allows for the use of one's CPF OA savings to pay for one's own, children's or spouse's tuition fees for full-time diploma or degree courses at approved educational institutions.",19,996,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00996
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As commercial interest rates increase and study loans become less affordable, perhaps we could enhance these existing schemes by raising the $2,700 gross monthly per capita income cap for the MOE Study Loan and extend the CPF Education Loan Scheme to cover more courses including part-time accredited diploma or degree courses. This will benefit a greater pool of Singaporeans who are in the pursuit of better education, better skills and who will ultimately be an asset in our workforce. Academic studies using US data have shown that an upskilled workforce has positive externalities to a sector, beyond the individual's gains.",20,997,2022-10-04-T-014-S-00997
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My third suggestion  we should not stop at assistance for individuals.

2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There might also be a need to take a targeted sector-specific approach. Construction and manufacturing are sectors that are known to be sensitive to interest rate hikes as they are capital-intensive and dependent on commercial loans. I will focus on construction firms as their cash flows are also tighter due to the longer-term nature of construction projects, which have not been helped by the labour and cost disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",24,1001,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01001
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The construction sector is critical to renewing Singapore's physical infrastructure, which itself is a key driver of our economic competitiveness. MND had announced in May 2022 that 58 Build-To-Order (BTO) projects were delayed by at least six months this year. This has already contributed to a tight housing supply situation and left many households in limbo waiting for their new houses to be completed. So, any uncertainty in interest rates could throw the sector into disarray again, within this post-pandemic period. So, it is important for the sector to be able to continue to access affordable loans.",25,1002,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01002

2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But aside from arguments about consolidation as a form of creative destruction in this sector and that some of the firms may have limited long-term viability anyway, the Government may need to step in to provide reliable and affordable sources of temporary financing to eligible SMEs and firms – temporary financing.",27,1004,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01004
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, I am thinking of schemes, such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP) that was rolled out during the pandemic, as well as the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme (TRECS), which offer firms the ability to lock in a favourable interest rate or electricity tariff, at times where such rates are extremely volatile.",28,1005,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01005
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The multiple extensions of TBLP, a support measure implemented to help firms with their financing needs during the pandemic, show that it is effective in meeting its purpose. I hope that the Government can consider a further extension past the current end-date of the scheme on 30 September 2022, or a replacement that is also focused on providing eligible SMEs with affordable interest rates.",29,1006,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01006
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"For the sake of fiscal prudence, I do not mean that we should commit to subsidising firms for a prolonged duration. What I have in mind is simply a temporary measure, to help our vulnerable firms and SMEs deal with interest rates that have doubled and may perhaps triple in just over a period of months. So, I urge the Government to provide updates as soon as possible on the duration of any support measures to help our firms with their forward planning.",30,1007,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01007
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Even as we try to enhance our long-term economic growth in this environment, we are fighting business decisions to reduce investments, made amidst higher hurdle rates for projects and investments. So, in addition, can the Government work further with financial institutions to keep the processing fees of these Government-assisted loans as low as possible?",31,1008,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01008
2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To add, we should make sure that the measures apply across both bank and non-bank financial institutions or lenders. The latter might rise in prominence in the lending sector, if the rise in interest rates makes it harder for those with relatively lower credit worthiness or urgent credit needs to access bank loans. Several of them already target SMEs primarily.",32,1009,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01009

2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The MAS has just raised interest rates used to calculate loan repayments under the TDSR by 0.5%.

2022-10-04-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, what is the impact of the current 0.5% adjustment on the TDSR data, and what would the projected impact of further increases be, considering the median TDSR of 43%? I ask these questions because, in part, housing loans are a long tenure, with significant overhang and forward risk exposure if the interest rates go up. And in an alternative worst-case scenario, if there is a wave of defaults/repossessions, there is always the risk of market instability with cascading social implications.",39,1016,2022-10-04-T-014-S-01016

Global stocks and even cryptocurrencies have already taken a hit with the latest Fed announcements on the need for more interest rate hikes.

2022-10-04-T-015,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The incidence of age discrimination has also fallen. Based on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Fair Employment Practices survey, the proportion of resident job applicants who experienced age discrimination during job search fell from 30.4% in 2018 to 18.9% in 2021. The proportion of resident employees who experienced discrimination during employment due to age is also relatively low, at 4.6% in 2021.",2,1063,2022-10-04-T-015-S-01063

2022-10-04-T-015,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"In addition, the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), requires employers to treat all employees and jobseekers, fairly and objectively. We take enforcement action against employers with discriminatory practices. Looking ahead, we will be enacting workplace fairness legislation. This will send a signal that there is no place for discrimination at the workplace. The legislation will broaden the range of measures and penalties available to address workplace discrimination, including age discrimination.",4,1065,2022-10-04-T-015-S-01065

2022-10-04-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Severe infections and illnesses, particularly those requiring intensive care, can result in acute kidney injury that necessitates dialysis. This has also been observed for COVID-19 patients who had become severely ill. Otherwise, COVID-19 has not been established to directly cause an increased risk of end-stage kidney disease requiring long-term dialysis. Likewise, there has been no established link, locally or internationally, between COVID-19 vaccines and kidney disease.",1,1067,2022-10-04-T-016-S-01067

2022-10-04-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Education (a) for primary schools that required balloting in 2021 and 2022, since the changes to the Primary 1 Registration Framework, what is the change in number and proportion of students who have obtained a place in a primary school residing (i) within one kilometre and (ii) within two kilometres of their residential address; and (b) what is the Government's assessment of the effectiveness of the change in the registration framework in achieving its stated objectives.",1,1073,2022-10-04-T-018-S-01073
2022-10-04-T-018,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Starting from the 2022 Primary 1 Registration Exercise, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has doubled the number of Phase 2C reserved places from 20 to 40, so that more children can be enrolled in a school near their homes. This is in the educational interest of the child and for the convenience of the family. The posting outcomes for this year's exercise are in line with this policy intent and we will continue to monitor the outcomes of future Primary 1 Registration Exercises closely.",1,1074,2022-10-04-T-018-S-01074

Within one kilometre of these schools, about 1,300 more students were admitted in 2022 than in 2021. Within two kilometres of these schools, about 1,100 more students were admitted in 2022 compared to 2021. In terms of proportion, this translates to 7% more students who obtained a place within one kilometre, and 6% more students who obtained a place within two kilometres. About 98% of Primary 1 registrants were able to obtain a place in a primary school of their choice or within two kilometres of their residence in 2021 and 2022.",2,1075,2022-10-04-T-018-S-01075
2022-10-04-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Transport having regard to the Government's plans for an electric vehicle population under the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and environmental impact from mining lithium, whether the Government will consider reviewing the relevance of the Preferential Additional Registration Fee scheme which was introduced to keep the average age of cars in Singapore young, reduce breakdown rates and pollution from exhaust fumes.",1,1076,2022-10-04-T-019-S-01076
2022-10-04-T-019,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) scheme incentivises motorists to deregister their cars before 10 years of age. It serves to reduce the number of old cars, so that there will be fewer breakdowns on our roads and less traffic disamenities. Over time, newer cars have come with cleaner engines. So, PARF does help to reduce air pollution on our roads.",1,1077,2022-10-04-T-019-S-01077
2022-10-04-T-019,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The PARF scheme has worked well so far, keeping the average age of the car population relatively young at nine to 10 years. Most cars still use internal combustion engines, the PARF scheme remains relevant.",2,1078,2022-10-04-T-019-S-01078
2022-10-04-T-019,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As we move towards a predominantly electric car population, LTA will closely monitor and study how an electric car's age could affect its propensity to break down and review the relevance of the PARF scheme.",3,1079,2022-10-04-T-019-S-01079
2022-10-04-T-020,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the proportion of time that teachers allocate to teaching versus non-teaching administrative duties in a given week; and (b) what is the current budget that schools allocate towards hiring of administrators that assist teachers in areas of non-teaching administrative activities, such as on procurement, billings and reception work.",1,1080,2022-10-04-T-020-S-01080
2022-10-04-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our teachers play many roles in school. Beyond teaching specific subjects, they nurture the whole child. This includes developing socioemotional competencies, life skills, attitudes and values through learning experiences, such as camps, co-curricular activities and other student programmes. Our teachers also provide student guidance and work in partnership with parents to support students.",1,1081,2022-10-04-T-020-S-01081

2022-10-04-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Each school has, on average, eight to nine administrative staff today, which include the school administration manager, information and communications technology (ICT) manager, operations manager and administration executives, who assist teachers with general administrative matters, procurement and financial operations as well as logistics support.",5,1085,2022-10-04-T-020-S-01085
2022-10-04-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have also given schools more flexibility to hire supplementary administrative manpower, who can be hired as adjunct or casual staff.

2022-10-04-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have also invested significantly over the last 10 years in teacher resourcing for schools. From 2011 to 2021, our pupil-teacher ratios have improved from 19 to 15 at the primary level and from 15 to 12 at the secondary level. We are now on par with average pupil-teacher ratios in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Given the tight labour market, there are limits to how much we can expand the teaching force, without a trade-off in quality.",9,1089,2022-10-04-T-020-S-01089

In egregious cases, CASE will refer errant suppliers to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) for investigation under CPFTA. CCCS may then apply for a Court injunction to restrain the supplier from engaging in the unfair practice. The Courts may also make accompanying orders, which include requiring the supplier to notify consumers of the injunction order and to report to CCCS any change to its business, such as the setting up of new branches. In the last five years, CCCS had investigated five cases involving pressure sales tactics. These suppliers have since ceased their unfair practices, and either signed VCAs with CASE or provided undertakings to CCCS.",3,1094,2022-10-04-T-021-S-01094

First, drivers can report fare evasion to the taxi or PHC operators, who will attempt to recover the fares on behalf of their drivers.

For instance, for time-sensitive frontline roles, or if the leave is for an extended period as is the case for maternity leave, employers typically reallocate work to other employees, or hire temporary or part-time workers to fill the gap. For less time-sensitive roles or when the leave duration is relatively short – for instance, a couple of days of childcare leave, employees could have the flexibility to adjust work schedules as long as overall work deliverables and deadlines are met.

Many applicants have been turned away. Where MAS has reason to suspect that an applicant is involved in illicit activities, MAS will, besides rejecting the application, refer the matter to the Police for investigation.",2,1234,2022-10-04-T-054-S-01234
2022-10-04-T-054,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),MAS also conducts surveillance to identify unlicensed firms that illegally provide DPT services or solicit customers in Singapore. It will instruct these entities to stop offering services to Singapore residents and refer them to the Police for investigation. MAS may also place them on its Investor Alert List to warn the public that these entities are not supervised by MAS.,3,1235,2022-10-04-T-054-S-01235
2022-10-04-T-054,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS also works closely with the Police to combat cryptocurrency scams. MAS and the Police have issued public advisories alerting consumers to guard against fraudulent websites soliciting cryptocurrency investments. When dealing with cryptocurrency firms, consumers should check if the entities are licensed or have been granted an exemption to hold a licence by referring to MAS' website.",4,1236,2022-10-04-T-054-S-01236

Of these, 63% were granted by HDB and the remaining 37% by financial institutions (FIs).",1,1238,2022-10-04-T-055-S-01238
2022-10-04-T-056,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Prime Minister whether he can provide an update on the ongoing review of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 that was announced by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in 2018.,1,1239,2022-10-04-T-056-S-01239
2022-10-04-T-056,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"The Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) is a key instrument in our fight against corruption. We must ensure that PCA remains effective to combat and deter corruption and that it enables us to fulfil our international obligations. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), in close consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), has reviewed PCA in this spirit. We would like to thank Members of the House for their suggestions relating to the review, which included those relating to corporate liability for corruption offences. CPIB took these suggestions into consideration in the review.",1,1240,2022-10-04-T-056-S-01240
2022-10-04-T-056,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"The review has concluded that PCA, as it stands, provides effective deterrence and adequately empowers CPIB to carry out its duties. There is, therefore, no need to amend or enhance the existing provisions. Besides providing for tough enforcement action against corrupt individuals, PCA offers sufficient basis for the prosecution of corporate bodies in Court if the facts of the case call for it. This extends to instances where corporate entities are found to be complicit in the corrupt conduct of their employees. CPIB has successfully taken corporate bodies to task in the past and will not hesitate to do so.",2,1241,2022-10-04-T-056-S-01241
2022-10-04-T-056,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act complements PCA by enabling the disgorgement of benefits obtained by a corporate body through the giving of bribes. Our legislative framework is, therefore, sufficiently robust to ensure that errant corporate bodies will have to bear the full brunt of the law and will not be able to enjoy any ill-gotten gains through corrupt means.",3,1242,2022-10-04-T-056-S-01242
2022-10-04-T-056,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"A robust anti-corruption framework goes beyond legislative instruments. The last Public Perception Survey conducted in 2020 cited strong political determination, along with effective anti-corruption law and heavy punishment, as the top three factors behind the low incidence of corruption in Singapore. Constant vigilance and a zero-tolerance attitude against corruption on the part of every Singaporean are also critical.",4,1243,2022-10-04-T-056-S-01243
2022-10-04-T-056,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"The corruption situation in Singapore is firmly under control and we are well-regarded internationally for our anti-corruption efforts. However, there is no room for complacency as the corruption threat is persistent and ever evolving. CPIB understands this very well. It will spare no effort not just in carrying out its work without fear or favour, but also in improving its capabilities to stay ahead of the corrupt. We must continue to support CPIB and do our part to keep corruption at bay.",5,1244,2022-10-04-T-056-S-01244

Once identified, IRAS subject cases to rigorous audit and investigation to determine whether tax offences have been committed. Where IRAS has established that tax evasion offences have been committed, IRAS will not hesitate to initiate Court proceedings to prosecute the taxpayer and/or the abettors. Those found guilty of tax evasion may face a penalty of up to four times the amount of tax evaded, a fine not exceeding $50,000, and/or imprisonment of up to seven years.",2,1247,2022-10-04-T-057-S-01247

In practice, most whistleblowers are not motivated by rewards. Most do not request, and thus do not receive, the reward for making tip-offs.",3,1248,2022-10-04-T-057-S-01248
2022-10-04-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Taken together, the penalties for non-compliance and rewards for whistleblowers have contributed to keeping tax evasion cases low.",4,1249,2022-10-04-T-057-S-01249
2022-10-04-T-058,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Home Affairs regarding reports in Southeast Asia of young people and jobseekers being lured into overseas job scams and human trafficking syndicates (a) what are the Ministry's steps to raise awareness of such scams and protect young Singaporeans based or travelling overseas for work; and (b) what roles will Singapore play in ASEAN to promote greater collaboration to tackle such syndicates together.,1,1250,2022-10-04-T-058-S-01250
2022-10-04-T-058,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The best defence against all scam types, including overseas jobs scams, is a discerning public. Our annual anti-scam public education campaign, called ""Spot the Signs. Stop the Crimes."", seeks to build awareness amongst the public on the tell-tale signs of scams and increase their vigilance. For job scams, these include online advertisements or unsolicited messages from unknown numbers which promise attractive salaries for seemingly easy work. The Police also work with schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to raise awareness amongst young people on scams.",1,1251,2022-10-04-T-058-S-01251

2022-10-04-T-059,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The replacement of the car's charge pipes from those originally installed by the manufacturer, to aftermarket charge pipes, was not considered an illegal modification under the Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s regulations. This is because aftermarket charge pipes do not affect a vehicle's safety.",1,1254,2022-10-04-T-059-S-01254
2022-10-04-T-059,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As part of the investigation for that fatal accident, the Traffic Police had sent the car for mechanical inspection.

2022-10-04-T-060,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there remains any utility in maintaining the provisions in Chapter 9 of the Penal Code 1871 dealing with corruption involving public servants after the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960.,1,1256,2022-10-04-T-060-S-01256
2022-10-04-T-060,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 (PCA) is the primary anti-corruption legislation in Singapore, it is complemented by other laws that deal with related forms of misconduct, such as the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992, the Penal Code 1871 and the Customs Act 1960.",1,1257,2022-10-04-T-060-S-01257
2022-10-04-T-060,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The offences under sections 161 to 165 of the Penal Code deal specifically with bribery and other forms of corrupt practices involving public servants. Compared to the offences in PCA, they are more targeted in scope towards tackling the various forms of bribery of, and the taking of bribes by, public servants. For example, section 165 makes it an offence for a public servant to accept anything of value, without payment or with inadequate payment, from any person with whom he is involved in an official capacity. Unlike in PCA, there is no need to further establish that this was an inducement or reward for the public servant to act in such a manner.",2,1258,2022-10-04-T-060-S-01258
