2022-10-05-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Prime Minister whether and, if so, how has the Ministry been working with family offices in Singapore to deepen investments in local companies.",1,1,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00001
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (on behalf of the Prime Minister),"Sir, our Government agencies are working to encourage family offices to  invest in local companies in a number of ways.",1,2,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00002
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (on behalf of the Prime Minister),"First, single family offices (SFOs) applying for tax incentive schemes have been required since April this year to allocate at least 10% or S$10million of their assets, whichever is lower, to local investments. Local investments may include  one, equities listed on Singapore exchanges; two, private equity investments in unlisted Singapore-incorporated companies; or three, qualifying debt securities.",2,3,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00003
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (on behalf of the Prime Minister),"Second, MAS and Enterprise Singapore have set up a number of platforms to connect local companies to potential investors, including family offices. These include ""Deal Fridays"", FinTech Investor sessions, and the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH), which we will be organising from 25-28 October, this month. We are also encouraging match-ups during the annual Singapore FinTech Festival, which will also be organised very shortly, from 2-4 November.",3,4,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00004
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (on behalf of the Prime Minister),"Third, MAS and EDB have supported the Wealth Management Institute’s Global-Asia Family Office Circle, which aims to encourage family offices here to make co-investments in companies as well as develop strategies in areas such as philanthropy and sustainable investments.",4,5,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00005
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (on behalf of the Prime Minister),"At the same time, we must recognise that family offices come to Singapore to access investment and philanthropic opportunities in the broader Asian region. This adds to Singapore’s status as a dynamic as well as purposeful financial centre, supporting growth and opportunity in our neighbouring countries.",5,6,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00006
2022-10-05-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.,1,7,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00007
2022-10-05-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have a couple of clarifications. The first is, how have and will local companies and the local workforce benefit from family offices? Second, where do these family offices generally come from? That is, which country or which industry were they operating in before they set up in Singapore?",1,8,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00008
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The SFOs generate employment in Singapore in a couple of ways. The first is by directly employing advisers and investment professionals; and also, to generate indirect employment when they work, for example, with external finance, tax and legal professionals, and also fund administrators, for example, custodians, on investment management, wealth planning and also operational matters. So, a wide aspect in both direct as well as indirect employment.",1,9,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00009
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"SFOs also expand the pool of patient capital for Singapore-based startups and business ventures, as well as Singapore-based funds that invest in such companies. Investee companies may also benefit from the strategic guidance offered by the principals of these family offices, many of whom themselves are owners of successful businesses.",2,10,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00010
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,Some families also use their SFOs or related entities to manage their investments and contributions towards social and philanthropic activities or causes in Singapore.,3,11,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00011
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the second supplementary question on where the SFOs originate from, the SFO community in Singapore is diverse, it is international. They come from a variety of regions, including Europe, the US as well as Asia. And families who are keen to set up a satellite presence here in Singapore, do so because of our favourable business environment, connectivity to the region which allow for them to use Singapore as a base to explore investment opportunities beyond Singapore to the region.",4,12,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00012
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I will also just share a little bit about what we are doing to attract these family offices, as related to that supplementary question. The Member may know that in 2019, MAS and EDB jointly set up the Family Office Development Team or FODT to coordinate a whole-of-Government effort to ensure Singapore remains a really relevant and attractive location for family offices. This development team has three focus areas.",5,13,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00013
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The first focus area is to enhance and widen the operating environment to broaden the suite of asset vehicles, such as variable capital companies (VCCs), that are available to these family offices.",6,14,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00014
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Second is to develop the capabilities and to build essential skillsets among our service providers, both local as well as foreign, and our professionals. For example, MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance launched these skill maps for family office advisers, including those at banks and tax or legal firms; and also, for entry level professionals employed in family offices; and also, then, management level executives who head and also run these offices. We also do training for advisers. For example, the Wealth Management Institute and the SMU Business Families Institute have launched a series of training programmes for family office advisers, professionals and principals that are then accredited against these skill maps.",7,15,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00015
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"So, if there are many individuals or professionals who are interested in entering this space or to deepen your capabilities, you can also take reference to these skill maps to better equip yourselves with the necessary skillsets to enter this industry. MAS has available co-funding schemes in place to offset the training fees for professionals attending these courses that have been accredited against these skill maps.",8,16,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00016
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Finally, we are also facilitating this community building amongst family offices such as supporting the setting up of the Global Asia Family Office Circle to galvanise and to encourage like-minded family offices towards common areas of interest, such as ESG, philanthropy enterprise financing and to create opportunities for collaboration amongst many other co-investments.",9,17,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00017
2022-10-05-T-001,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The final point is that we have, as a posture, consistently welcomed a variety of financial and other capital investments into Singapore. We have welcomed individual companies that can contribute to Singapore's growth, create good jobs, regardless of where they are and regardless of their country of origin where they come from. So, we need to remain open, we need to remain connected to global investors to strengthen Singapore's value proposition to Asia and to be a key Asian node for high growth tech investment and tech companies to base here, to grow their patient capital, and then to grow and be a base for new and exciting industries, and ultimately, create good jobs for Singaporeans.",10,18,2022-10-05-T-001-S-00018
2022-10-05-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked the Minister for Education when and how are salary scale and benefit reviews conducted and recommended for (i) educators from mainstream schools, preschools and special education schools and (ii) other staff such as education psychologists, job coach therapists and school leaders serving in these education institutions.",1,19,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00019
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, MOE periodically reviews the salaries of officers in MOE schemes of service and, in consultation with the Public Service Division, considers making appropriate adjustments to ensure that their overall salary packages remain market competitive.",1,20,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00020
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Salary adjustments take into consideration the size of the salary gaps compared to market benchmarks. Generally, larger adjustments are made when the gap with the market benchmarks is wider. This is in line with the principle that Civil Service salaries should keep pace with but not lead the market.",2,21,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00021
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"MOE recently announced salary adjustments for all eligible Education Officers (EOs), Allied Educators (AEDs) and MOE Kindergarten Educators (MKEs), which took effect on 1 October 2022. These adjustments also apply to MOE staff seconded to other agencies.",3,22,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00022
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),ECDA is separately conducting a salary review for Early Childhood educators in government-supported preschools to ensure that their salaries are commensurate with their contributions and professional skills. The salary review is expected to be completed by end 2022 and ECDA will work with government-supported operators to implement the changes from 2023 onwards.,4,23,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00023
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Special Education (SPED) schools are run by Social Service Agencies (SSAs). While SPED schools receive full funding, SSAs retain substantial autonomy in HR practices, including how they compensate SPED school staff.",5,24,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00024
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Nevertheless, MOE, in our role in overseeing the SPED sector, works closely with and supports the SSAs to ensure that salaries for SPED teachers remain competitive through periodic compensation reviews. In 2018, salaries were reviewed together with the National Council of Social Service. In 2020, salaries were again reviewed with the introduction of the Journeys of Excellence Package. This Journeys package contains several complementary initiatives to raise the quality and professionalism of the SPED teaching profession by strengthening their competencies, expertise and career progression. Additional funding is provided for manpower costs in two tranches – the first has been implemented in 2021 and the second is planned for 2024. MOE will continue to work with SSAs so that our SPED teachers have good career progression and updated salary guidelines.",6,25,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00025
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"For non-teaching SPED school staff such as psychologists, the SSAs take reference from the NCSS sector salary guidelines for different professions. The guidelines are updated annually.",7,26,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00026
2022-10-05-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms Denise Phua.,1,27,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00027
2022-10-05-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Let me declare that I am a volunteer at several people sector charities and helping out in special schools as well.,1,28,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00028
2022-10-05-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Recently, when the announcement for MOE teachers or Education Officers was made, it created quite a bit of ripple amongst the special education sector and also in the rest of the people sector where organisations take in students who graduate from the special schools. When announcements, such as this, are made unilaterally, it does affect the others. Sometimes, the approach or the methodology by which these compensation reviews are made, are either not known or perhaps could be missed out when the original announcements were made.",2,29,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00029
2022-10-05-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I think it is always good and would MOE consider that when it makes announcements of such nature, especially in terms of compensation, that it be not announced unilaterally and that mention be made of the rest of the sector who are also serving the children, the young people or the older people of Singapore in education? So, that is one, that announcements will also make some mention of the rest of the service providers.",3,30,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00030
2022-10-05-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Number two, I would like MOE to consider and communicate to the SSAs – either special schools or disability organisations – the philosophy by which their salaries are computed or decided upon. Because for some of the positions – such as the educators, psychologists, therapists and so forth – both sectors, the people and public sectors, are recruiting from the same pool. The competitiveness is quite important because you want to serve such persons throughout their lifespan. So, the philosophy is quite important because they could be recruiting from the same pool. So, I would appreciate that MOE would consider some of what I have shared.",4,31,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00031
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the first comment by Ms Denise Phua, yes, indeed, Public Service Division and MOE, as part of the wider service, regularly review the salary scales for different professions. I would say that, in general, we do this progressively, systematically and continuously. The reason that we do not announce everything at one go is because we do the work in stages. But every time we announce a change in one particular profession, we will certainly take into account the other professions to make sure that the relativities are maintained, both within the sector and also beyond the sector, with other professions.",1,32,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00032
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second comment, we will continue to share our methodologies of how this is done in the public sector with the people sector. The methodology of how we compute the salaries and the remuneration packages – all this is not a secret. We do it openly and there is an open methodology of how we do it. We will be very happy to share this with the rest of the SSAs.",2,33,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00033
2022-10-05-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.,1,34,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00034
2022-10-05-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Sir. It is important that in every sector in the economy, we must allocate some of our top talents. So, even in preschools and SPED schools, are we allocating our top talents? For example, is the Public Service Commission (PSC) offering scholarships to allow some of our top talents to be trained in those areas so that, in the future, they can lead the sectors?",1,35,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00035
2022-10-05-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, in the long run, we must also ensure that every sector has a fair salary structure. For example, we cannot assume that the preschool teachers are of a lower level than the teachers in the Junior Colleges. So, in the long run, we must align the competencies, we must make sure that we recognise the competency level in every of these sectors and remunerate them accordingly. We have heard a lot of stories that overseas, there are Masters and PhD holders becoming teachers of preschools, for example.",2,36,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00036
2022-10-05-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Sorry, Mr Leong Mun Wai, are you asking a question or are you —",1,37,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00037
2022-10-05-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, I am asking the question whether there are plans in the future that will ensure that these remuneration packages for preschools and special education areas will continue to improve.",1,38,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00038
2022-10-05-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,Minister Chan Chun Sing.,1,39,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00039
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to Mr Leong's first comment, yes, indeed, first of all, we try to get a fair share of talent into the Public Service. Within the Public Service, we will spread the talent across different agencies and different professional areas to make sure that all sectors have a fair share of talent. So, that we have done.",1,40,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00040
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Specific to Mr Leong Mun Wai's question, Mr Leong might want to know or may already know that actually when I was in the Ministry of Social and Family Development, we have a talent development scheme working with the SSAs. In fact, one of the schemes that we started many years ago was the Sun Ray Scheme where we develop top talent or capable people and rotate them across agencies to give them exposure beyond the agencies because my personal belief is that we do not develop people within each agency alone in a stovepipe. Our aim is to make sure that they get a broader exposure so that the good ideas can spread around faster and the whole sector itself can benefit. So, we have been doing that and we will continue to do that.",2,41,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00041
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On Mr Leong Mun Wai's second point about the salary structure, indeed, that is also what we have always been doing to make sure that every sector is compensated competitively. Of course, we do not take compensation as the only reason to help people stay in the sector. It is also about career development, their route of advancement, the working environment and so forth.",3,42,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00042
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But I would just like to raise one nuanced point. I think we should be very careful about remunerating people based on credentials. In fact, in the whole economy, we are encouraging people to remunerate people based on their skills, capabilities and not just based on their credentials. So, whether educators have Masters, PhD or basic degree or diploma, I think we need to look at them, but we also need to look beyond that and look at the kind of skillsets that people have and the kind of contributions that people have made. I would not say that just because someone has a Masters, therefore, they will obviously be paid more than someone who might be very experienced in the sector itself.",4,43,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00043
2022-10-05-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We look at it holistically. We look at some of the prior training that our people have, the contributions that they are making in the sector and the kind of experiences that they have. I think these are all the factors that will help us to make a remuneration package that is both fair and competitive.",5,44,2022-10-05-T-002-S-00044
2022-10-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government can provide updates on (i) the progress of the framework for the equitable sharing of losses suffered by scam victims and (ii) the work of the Payments Council in reviewing the practices that the financial industry can put in place to better protect consumers from scams; and (b) what are current and upcoming efforts of Project Frontier and the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams on combating scams.,1,45,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00045
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister),"MAS is working with the industry to finalise a framework for the equitable sharing of losses resulting from scams. The Payments Council has proposed a draft set of responsibilities relevant to financial institutions and consumers. MAS is finalising the framework, in coordination with other Government agencies. It is taking us longer than expected to design a fair and effective framework that ensures shared responsibility across the ecosystem as well as incentives for each party to be vigilant against scams. MAS aims to seek public comments on the framework as soon as possible.",1,46,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00046
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister),"At the broader level, the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS), chaired by the Ministry of Home Affairs, also partners the financial institutions closely. This includes Project FRONTIER, as mentioned by the Member, where the Police have established processes with financial institutions to swiftly freeze bank accounts suspected of being used in scams, in order to mitigate victims’ losses and disrupt scammers’ operations. From January to June 2022, the Police froze more than 7,800 accounts and recovered more than S$80 million worth of scam proceeds.",2,47,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00047
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister),"The IMCS has also strengthened enforcement against perpetrators. Since the formation of the Singapore Police Force’s Anti-Scam Command in March this year, more than 4,300 scammers and money mules who were involved in more than 12,000 scam cases involving S$101 million were either arrested or called up for investigation.",3,48,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00048
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister),"Other than enforcement actions, the IMCS has expanded its public education campaign, called ""Spot the Signs. Stop the Crimes"", to build public awareness and vigilance on how to spot scams. For instance, it has shared materials advising the public to not share personal details, such as log-in credentials and one-time-passwords, with unverified parties. IMCS will continue to work with all stakeholders to deepen its public outreach.",4,49,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00049
2022-10-05-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.,1,50,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00050
2022-10-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for the answers. I have two supplementary questions.",1,51,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00051
2022-10-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),One is in relation to the loss-sharing framework that the Minister of State shared. I have residents who came up to me to highlight about some of their loss-sharing issues. I was wondering whether the Minister of State can share how fast this can be rolled out because it has a direct impact on residents in monetary terms.,2,52,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00052
2022-10-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Two, in relation to the knowledge of contact information for scams, I have a few residents who came up to me experiencing a scam in process while they are literally speaking to a scammer, called 999 but was informed that that is not the number to call. So, I was wondering whether more can be done via Project FRONTIER to ensure that there is some coordination between the Police and the banks to handle such situations.",3,53,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00053
2022-10-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, I hope the Minister of State can share a bit more on that front in terms of coordination and whether Project FRONTIER can, together with IMCS, actually enhance that.",4,54,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00054
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Saktiandi Supaat for the supplementary questions.",1,55,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00055
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the loss-sharing framework, I think the major principle is for us to find a good platform in which to design a fair and effective framework such that many of the different parties have a shared responsibility, all aspects of it. It is taking us longer than expected because to put in all of the key aspects in place requires us to make sure where the shared responsibility lies equitably across all of the different stakeholders. But we continue to work on this at a very urgent pace. We understand that this is urgent work and what we are trying to do is to make sure that this loss-sharing and accountability approach incorporates as well as involves all key parties in the ecosystem and every single aspect of this. Every stakeholder has to be vigilant in their own right against scams, both institutions as well as individuals. That is why, in my original answer, I said that it was important for all of us to also conduct public outreach and also for the financial institutions and authorities to play their part. What we are trying to achieve is, as I mentioned, a fair as well as effective framework so that there is shared responsibility across the ecosystem.",2,56,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00056
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the Member's residents, this is something that is very important for us to bear in mind. If members of the public face this issue, they should notify their banks immediately, if they suspect that they are victims of scams. Many of the financial institutions, in fact, the major retail banks, have made it easier for the public to report scams by either having dedicated hotline numbers or making it the first few options on their phone banking menu. So, members of the public are encouraged to obtain such hotline numbers from the official sources, such as at the back of the ATM cards and to also save the numbers on their mobile phones.",3,57,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00057
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"In addition, members of the public can also file a Police report either online or in person if they have lost money to scams. They can call the anti-scam hotline at 1800 722 6688 for advice. This is managed by both the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and also the latest ScamShield app that is available now on both android as well as IOS can also be used to report suspicious scam messages. But, in concert, all of these are also a work in progress. We also encourage members of the public to give us feedback and also the financial institutions as well as the retail banks on how to tighten this further as we continue to fight as an ecosystem against scams.",4,58,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00058

2022-10-05-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I have raised PQs on this topic before. I have two supplementary questions.,1,60,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00060
2022-10-05-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, does MAS track the response time from notification to a Government agency or the bank till the time the illegal transfer is interrupted in cases where residents discover an illegal transfer in progress?",2,61,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00061
2022-10-05-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Secondly, for this equitable risk-sharing framework, will the agencies continue to consider the point I raised previously, that is, the idea that there can be a continuum between an unforced error and a forced error, depending on the sophistication of the scammer?",3,62,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00062
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I thank Dr Tan Wu Meng for his supplementary questions. Maybe I will share about the second question first with regard to the equitable risk-sharing framework on the continuum between the error as well as the unforced error. These are issues or steps that we are taking proactively within consultation. MAS, with regard to the other agencies, are looking into this equitable sharing framework and will take into account both this broad continuum because the instance where a scam is being perpetrated, as well as the discovery, these are all quite critical in terms of finding the perpetrator, in terms of making sure that there is recovery as well. So, we will factor those into our discussions.",1,63,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00063
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the first question, at this point in time, we do not track those data. But we will take into account the Member's feedback.",2,64,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00064
2022-10-05-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,I will allow one last supplementary question because we need to move on to dengue. Ms Denise Phua.,1,65,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00065
2022-10-05-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Two supplementary questions for the Minister of State.",1,66,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00066
2022-10-05-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Firstly, does MAS require the banks or the financial institutions to notify their customers should there be regular and/or big sums of withdrawals or money movements from their accounts? I know some banks do it, some banks do not, but I wonder if there is actually a regulation, practice or policy regarding this.",2,67,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00067
2022-10-05-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Secondly, I know that MAS is working very hard on the framework and so forth to ensure loss-sharing and recourse like that. But I wonder what the interim recourse is for the scam victims. I have a resident, for example, who lost his life savings of almost a quarter million dollars and he did the right thing – make a Police report, wrote to the authorities, wrote to the banks and so forth, but still extremely distraught and distressed. So, I wonder what is the recourse for victims like this.",3,68,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00068
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,I thank the Member for her questions. I think many of our residents have also shared with regard to the scams and one of the issues with regard to banks as well as the scams is on individual responsibility as well. But we also make sure that we have constant updates with the Police and will also inform customers on how to report to the Police.,1,69,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00069
2022-10-05-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I know that this issue with regard to scams is a rather new one because of the online as well as technology. But what we are trying to do with both the loss-sharing framework as well as the public outreach to individuals and also to encourage the banks to have good processes in place will be very important for us to manage this issue in a fair and equitable way. But that notwithstanding, we want to encourage all members of the public to, first, be extremely vigilant. If you see any of these funds being transferred outside, that is, unusual transactions, please inform your banks immediately. We, on the MAS front, are coordinating very closely with the Police as well as the financial institutions to tighten these processes and this consultation will come in due time so that we can tighten these processes and combat scams together.",2,70,2022-10-05-T-003-S-00070
2022-10-05-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there has been an increasing number of feedback received on insect or mosquito bites in areas where Project Wolbachia was introduced despite that these male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes do not bite; and (b) whether the Ministry will provide resources to residents or neighbourhoods experiencing such a situation to address these feedback.,1,71,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00071

Bites from these mosquitoes are correspondingly significantly reduced. This is evident in the reduction of dengue cases by up to 70% observed in study sites with at least one year of releases. However, as Wolbachia-Aedes technology does not affect other species of mosquitoes, residents may still experience some bites from such mosquitoes.",2,73,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00073

These communication and outreach activities are done prior to releases and include door-to-door distribution of publicity materials, display of posters and banners at high footfall areas and sharing of information via traditional and social media platforms. NEA also engages establishments such as childcare centres and schools within the release sites.",3,74,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00074

2022-10-05-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Will NEA, besides traditional sources of media banners and all that, consider also having ground walkabouts and educational talks directly to homes and community areas such as malls, schools and coffee shops to promote and perhaps to assuage the initial alarm on the rollout of Project Wolbachia?",2,78,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00078
2022-10-05-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as mentioned in the reply, prior to release, NEA does engage the community. Specific to the Punggol site, prior to release on 30 August, there was door-to-door distribution of letters to residents and establishments at HDB blocks, display of banners, posters at lift lobbies, to inform residents of the release schedule as well as emails to schools, childcare centres and condominiums.",1,79,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00079
2022-10-05-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"We take the Member's feedback that, on top of these channels, we should explore more targeted, direct engagement, including door-to-door, so that this will increase the community's awareness, understanding, buy-in and support of the Project Wolbachia. This is important so that we can reduce the number of dengue infections and potentially, fatalities. We thank the Member for her suggestion and NEA will work closely with her on such outreach.",2,80,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00080

2022-10-05-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Like Member Ms Yeo Wan Ling, I also received similar feedback from some residents on the increasing prevalence of mosquitoes, which I presumed is due to the release of these male  Wolbachia",1,82,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00082
2022-10-05-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"And I ask this because I received an email from NEA earlier in March, in terms of support for the publicity of Project Wolbachia, in terms of the engagement of residents. But while I attended such an online zoom session in March, I thought it was also important to gain a firsthand understanding, hence requested to actually participate in some of these study sites and release activities. But I only learnt last week that these community engagement efforts are conducted only through People's Association (PA) and I was not able to participate.",2,83,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00083
2022-10-05-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"NEA works with the community and grassroots to carry out these outreach programmes, as with all the various Government initiatives. In addition to that, particularly for  Project Wolbachia,",1,84,2022-10-05-T-004-S-00084
2022-10-05-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry is aware of and has reviewed studies conducted by other countries which have found that people exposed to second-hand smoke are more likely to be suffering from depression, anxiety, stress, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and dementia; and (b) if so, whether the Ministry will review policies on tackling second-hand smoke at homes in light of these studies.",1,85,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00085

2022-10-05-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Minister of State for all her replies on second-hand smoke over the years. But, could I just ask whether there is a threshold we need to reach before we will look into reviewing our policies and legislation? Is there perhaps a certain number of deaths or number of people who are affected by this before we would change? I ask this because we already know that it does cause death, it does cause physical harm to our health and now we realise, even our mental health. So, what more will it take before we are willing to amend our policies?",1,89,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00089
2022-10-05-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Firstly, let me say that, whilst there is evidence of a link between second-hand tobacco smoke and mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and so on, the evidence is currently inconclusive as to whether the second-hand smoke exposure directly causes these mental health condition or is simply associated with these mental health conditions. That means, it is a sign that it is an environment that contributes to these mental health conditions, just to explain your earlier query.",1,90,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00090
2022-10-05-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But notwithstanding this, let me assure the Member that we are as concerned about the harmful effects of second-hand tobacco smoke on non-smokers. And in fact, that is the reason why over the decades, we have put in tremendous effort and resources to reducing the prevalence of smoking, through various efforts as I have said, whether it is education, provision of cessation services, legislation, taxation as well as constantly looking out for reasonable and practical solutions to further strengthen these efforts to address the issue of second-hand tobacco smoke.",2,91,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00091
2022-10-05-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For instance, this month, 1 October 2022, we have further extended the smoking prohibited areas to additional public gardens and parks, as well as ABC water sites and 10 recreational beaches, including that in Sentosa. Which means that as of now, some 50,000 places, they are banned – where smoking is prohibited. So, we will continue as I have said, to look at how we can strengthen our efforts. Both MOH, HPB, NEA and the various stakeholders, we will consistently look at the evidence as well as the solutions available and will not hesitate to adjust or review this where appropriate.",3,92,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00092

2022-10-05-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"A short one. If I could ask the Senior Minister of State, we are doing so much to protect people from second-hand smoke in the public areas, could we apply similar efforts to protecting them at their own homes. It seems strange that when they are out there. they are all protected, but then when they reach home, they keep smelling second-hand smoke. Two, I am in touch with the researcher. So, if we can provide some conclusive evidence that it is linked to mental health, will MSE then amend our policies?",1,94,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00094
2022-10-05-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Again, as I have said, we are concerned about the harmful effects of second-hand tobacco smoke, notwithstanding whether it leads to depression and so on, because we know that second-hand tobacco smoke also increases the risk of cancer. So, there is no doubt that we are as concerned. Regarding second-hand tobacco smoke in homes, I think I have reiterated my answers many times. I do not think I need to repeat them again.",1,95,2022-10-05-T-005-S-00095

2022-10-05-T-006,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Sorry. The first is in regard to the utilisation rates of these bicycles lots across the different transit stations. And the second is, I understand that under the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 (LTMP), we do have targets for a 20-minute town and 45-minutes city, so whether or not we could set certain targets as to the number of lots in order to support these ambitions under the LTMP.",1,102,2022-10-05-T-006-S-00102

In particular for Mr Louis Chua's area, based on a survey in 2022, the bicycle parking at Sengkang and Buangkok MRT stations has utilisation rates of about 65% and 77% respectively.

The first and last mile journeys are important and we do hope that more people can take to walking or cycling to reach these nodes. LTA has published broad planning parameters for MRT stations under the Walking and Cycling Design Guide, which will be applied for new MRT stations. These were developed considering factors such as MRT ridership, the number of dwelling units served and existing data and surveys. So, whether that station is a first mile or last mile station, whether it is near to, for example, foreign workers dormitories, the range of parking lot provisions will have a certain spectrum. So, for example, the range for first mile station is between 250 and 800; it is quite a big range depending on each locality.",2,105,2022-10-05-T-006-S-00105

2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the academic calendars of the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are planned to support students' learning experiences. This includes ensuring sufficient time for both curriculum coverage and student life during term time. The Polytechnic calendar also takes into consideration when students enroll into their courses. There are currently no plans to align the Polytechnic academic calendars with Primary and Secondary schools. There are, however, overlaps between the term breaks of our schools and Polytechnics.",1,123,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00123
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The academic schedules in IHLs for Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes leading to full qualifications, such as part-time diploma and degree programmes, are broadly aligned with Pre-Employment Training (PET) programmes. Short modular courses and Workforce Skills Qualifications, however, are designed with a more flexible programme schedule and do not necessarily align with the academic calendars for the longer programmes. This better meets the needs of adult learners, who have to juggle both work and learning.",2,124,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00124
2022-10-05-T-008,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Dr Wan Rizal.,1,125,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00125

2022-10-05-T-008,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Sir, my concern is really for the academic staff, as well as the students from both PET and CET programmes. In December, for example, PET students undergo an exam period, that is, in December, they have the first two weeks of exams, followed by two weeks of supposed break. However, they are given graded assignments also, which means that throughout December, they are supposed to finish an assignment before they come back in January. Which means, probably, that they will not spend their December holidays. This means that they will spend less time with their family and catch-up with the younger siblings, if they have these.",2,127,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00127
2022-10-05-T-008,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"For CET students, the December period, especially for the part-time diplomas, that actually transcends throughout. For example, in December, their lessons are throughout December. And this means that, for us to encourage them to do a part-time diploma and have a work-life balance, this means sacrificing their December holidays, and in the spirit of celebrating families, I think that this is something that we are missing.",3,128,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00128
2022-10-05-T-008,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"The staff, they have to do the markings in December, which means they are usually affected. Or if they are teaching CET students like I do, we do not get the December holidays as a whole. So, will the Ministry consider removal of mid semestral assessments, both in terms of exams as well as these graded assignments within the December period?",4,129,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00129
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we share the Member's concern for family time. But I should perhaps lay down the following considerations on how we determine when we should go for breaks for different parts of our society.",1,130,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00130
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I think different parts of our society will have different needs, be it Primary schools, Preschools, Secondary schools, post-Secondary schools, Universities and adult learners. It may also not necessarily be the best idea for all of us to say that all of them should take their breaks together and align it as such. Because I do believe that different parts of our society do have different requirements and it is quite difficult for us to, therefore, have one model that fits everything. I am quite sure that even if we do align it, there will be other challenges as well.",2,131,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00131
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, I think we have to consider the different learning needs of different segments of our population. For example, when we should have the term breaks for our IHLs is not just about what they learn in school. One of the very critical parts of the learning environment for our IHLs has to do with their internship opportunities. And in fact, in more recent times, I have also urged our IHLs to move away from what we rigidly think of as term time and break time, because that may not be necessarily the best way for us to fit the internship opportunities into the working environment that is required by the participating companies.",3,132,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00132
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Companies would like to have interns according to their business needs, rather than just the academic calendars. So, we need to take in to account all these differing needs.",4,133,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00133
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"All the more so for adult learners in the continuing education and training programmes, that they would have different needs, different courses would have different internship opportunities and we have to take all this into account.",5,134,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00134
2022-10-05-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, it would not be very possible nor very wise for us to work on the premise of one single consideration and, therefore, try to align all our school calendars from preschool, all the way to IHLs, according to only one consideration.",6,135,2022-10-05-T-008-S-00135
2022-10-05-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Minister for National Development since HDB has applied the Universal Design (UD) concept for flats built from 2006 to make them functional, accessible and safe (a) whether it is feasible to incorporate the UD concept for flats built before 2006 to better support seniors and those with mobility challenges living in these older flats; and (b) if so, whether there are plans to do so.",1,136,2022-10-05-T-009-S-00136

For older blocks, UD and barrier-free design features based on the prevailing Code of Accessibility in the Built Environment are incorporated, where feasible, when the blocks undergo upgrading. We have also introduced the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to provide direct lift access to HDB residents by adding new lifts and lift shafts to eligible blocks, where feasible.",1,137,2022-10-05-T-009-S-00137

2022-10-05-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I thank the Minister of State for his answers. I do have two supplementary questions. One is with regard to the design and accessibility outside of the flats, especially the older flats. There has been quite a bit of improvements with NRP and the various upgrading, but in terms of some of the older blocks, especially for example, those in Simei, where there is a level issue in the void decks because of the scupper drains. They do serve a purpose, but going forward, and with the advance in design and all that, is HDB looking at how to address the unevenness caused by the scupper drains, because the pathways are quite narrow for blocks of flats that were built during this time.",1,141,2022-10-05-T-009-S-00141
2022-10-05-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"My second supplementary question is within the flats themselves. Yes, the EASE programme has served the needs of our residents, in terms of helping with mobility and with the grab bars and the ramps, but is HDB looking at enhancing the EASE programme with regard to ramps or any other features? Because with the ageing population and those with mobility struggles, I think there is more that can be done around EASE and also, with regards to the width of the doorway entrances of flats. Because I visited many of my residents and I have noticed that the doorways are really quite narrow. Even if you have EASE and the right ramps, if the wheelchairs cannot go into the toilets or the bedrooms with ease, then it still does not serve the purpose. So, I hope HDB will look at this.",2,142,2022-10-05-T-009-S-00142
2022-10-05-T-009,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. For the first supplementary question, I take note of her feedback and we will take it back to the Ministry.",1,143,2022-10-05-T-009-S-00143
2022-10-05-T-009,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In regard to the second question, yes, the EASE programme is popular.

2022-10-05-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the number of Primary school students requiring counselling for mental health issues have risen in the last five years; and (b) how are such students managed as they transition into Secondary school and beyond.,1,145,2022-10-05-T-010-S-00145
2022-10-05-T-010,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the number of Primary school students being referred to school counsellors for mental health-related issues was stable between 2017 and 2021. Some of these students may require counselling support even after they graduate from Primary schools. The school counsellors facilitate this by engaging parents to discuss how the counselling support can be extended in the child's new school. With the parents' consent, information such as the strategies to support the child and his challenges will be shared with the receiving school. Such information will be managed sensitively and will only be shared on a need-to-know basis.",1,146,2022-10-05-T-010-S-00146

I think the Minister of State mentioned that such information will be sensitively managed and shared on a need-to-know basis. Could the Minister of State further explain, with regard to even sharing the information beyond MOE, for example, in the future with other Government agencies, how is that information managed and accessed?",1,148,2022-10-05-T-010-S-00148
2022-10-05-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"For example, if a male student should need to get mental support, mental healthcare, throughout his scholastic journey, and when he enlists in the Army, would MINDEF have accessibility to that kind of information, which is typically I am assuming, held by MOE.

Is it possible that the studies that she cited be provided on a more disaggregated basis?

Users will only be prompted to fill fields relevant to the scope of powers and appointment under their LPA applications. For example, if a user indicates his intent to appoint only one donee, the online form will not have a field on how multiple donees should act. Key legal terms will be explained in simple language.

I think the importance of LPA is obvious and certainly more so for the seniors, the elderly. My supplementary question to Minister is whether, currently, is he able to let us know how many of us have already done our LPAs? Whatever the number is, I think it is not enough. So, my question is, how can we accelerate this and bring this to a much higher level? And it should really start at a much younger age, where possible.

It is important for us to help ourselves, especially, and those that we love to make sure the LPA is signed.

This serves to make the ownership and control of such entities more transparent and thus reduce opportunities for the misuse of such entities for illicit purposes.

For example, SIT has started with conceptualising micro-credentialing, in which students will take modules at different points in time, during their career. The broader concept we are introducing to our students is that you do not necessarily have to see the university as your immediate end point after your GCE “A” Levels. Even those who qualify immediately do not necessarily have to go directly to the universities. We do encourage them to have a taste of the work and industry so that they have a better idea if that is indeed the field that they want to get into.",2,224,2022-10-05-T-016-S-00224

2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the potential of Healthier SG. A key thrust of the Healthier SG White Paper is that residents will be encouraged to enrol with a family doctor even when they are well so that they may benefit from advice regarding social interventions to adopt healthier lifestyles. It is envisaged that the doctor will take charge of the overall well-being of the resident for a period of time, rather than to treat the patient on an episodic basis. This holds much promise for a healthier nation overall.",3,236,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00236
2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In moving the Motion yesterday, the Health Minister assessed that the returns of better health outcomes from Healthier SG would take maybe eight to 10 years before tangible results might be seen. However, on returns based on dollars and cents terms, there are encouraging experiences from overseas. Prevention strategies have been shown to make economic sense as they are substantially cost-saving. It is well-known that it is preferable for healthcare systems to aim to prevent ill health rather than to subsequently treat it from a financial standpoint.",4,237,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00237
2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Five years ago, a systematic review was published, assessing the returns from investing in public health interventions such as promoting well-being and preventing ill health in society. From 52 studies of healthcare systems in high-income countries, it was found that the return on investment (ROI) of public health interventions was at the median of 14 to one, that, is, for every one dollar invested in public health, $14 will be subsequently returned to the wider health and social care economy. Although we do not yet know what returns Healthier SG might bring in dollars and cents, there is reason to be optimistic.",5,238,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00238

At Chapter 5 of the White Paper, it is stated that to fund Healthier SG, the Government intends to roll out capitation funding first to family doctors and then to the geographical healthcare clusters. There are scant details in the White Paper about how this will be implemented and the Minister yesterday did give a few more details.

The Ministry's stated objective for adopting capitation funding is to, and I quote, ""Create an inherent incentive for healthcare providers to focus on preventive care and right siting of patients."" Put another way, healthcare providers who keep patients healthy and do not over service their patients will benefit under a system of capitation funding.",11,244,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00244

2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"At the same time, capitation funding has been the subject of research in many countries, particularly on whether such funding has led to healthcare providers to function as economic agents, that is, instead of focusing on the patient's best interest, healthcare providers look at the financial bottom-line and behave in certain ways which may not be in the patient's best interest. I am not saying this will happen for Healthier SG but we should be alive to the risk.",13,246,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00246
2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"There is evidence from several studies overseas that capitation funding models tended to result in patients receiving less treatment, that is, they went to the doctor less frequently and their treatments tended to cost less than compared with the FFS models. It is often not clear whether this was a result of capitation working well by cutting down unnecessary treatments and waste, or whether, on the other hand, patients were, in fact, underserved, that is, not getting adequate treatment. It also goes without saying that the level of funding is key. If capitation funding is pegged more generously, the quality of care would generally be better.",14,247,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00247
2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),Some studies focus on doctors' own assessments of whether the way they treated patients was different and under capitation funding compared to FFS models. There were indications that some physicians believed that funding had affected their choices of treatment.,15,248,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00248
2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"There has also been concern whether capitation funding would lead to healthcare providers cherry-picking their patients.

2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Coming back to Healthier SG, I am pleased to note that the White Paper states that the capitation funding formula ""will be tiered based on the health risk profile of each enrolled resident, scope of required care and the progress made in terms of preventive care for chronic disease management."" Could the Ministry clarify what level of granularity will be used to tier the funding, for instance, will the funding be tiered based on the disease diagnosis and the stage of the disease progression?",17,250,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00250
2022-10-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Yesterday, the Minister also touched on the overall finance and budget implications of Healthier SG. He said that the set-up cost over three to four years would be about $1 billion, while there would be recurrent cost of about $400 million a year, including the annual servicing fee for patients. Does this mean that the Ministry has already worked out the detailed capitation sums for each health risk profile, and when will this information be published?",18,251,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00251

Besides having incentives to consult family doctor regularly, there will also be a need for a supportive infrastructure and to change mindsets. On infrastructure, the Government has built sporting facilities and beautiful park connectors for Singaporeans to exercise in. Besides that, healthier food needs to be affordably priced so that less privileged Singaporeans can afford to make healthy choices daily. Whatever the case, in the final analysis, changing people's deep-seated habits might be the most difficult of all.",21,254,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00254

2022-10-05-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Years ago, some of my Parliamentary colleagues and I proposed to the Government to allow residents to visit neighbourhood clinics instead of polyclinics, while benefiting from the lower outpatient service fees charged by polyclinics. The Government then launched the CHAS scheme, allowing residents to visit their own GP clinics at the price of polyclinic fees. Since its implementation, the plan has been welcomed by residents. I also shared feedback from residents at that time. In many cases, residents often perceive that their family doctors were more cordial, reliable and trustworthy. So, recoveries were quick after the visits.",3,261,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00261

Will assisted support on-site and via helplines be available at the clinic itself or at CCs? As many seniors are non-IT savvy and some may be illiterate, they will not be able to use the apps after enrolment to monitor their health progress. They may require simple printed materials to do manual recording. This means that the GPs will have to manually key in the progress reports into the available system to enable monitoring. This is additional work for GPs if they have many of such senior patients.",15,273,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00273

2022-10-05-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I doubt anyone with no sickness would want to see a doctor regularly. If a healthy person sees the GP for their first health consultation under Healthier SG or subsequent follow up, will they be given a medical certificate (MC) or memo to excuse them from their work?

Will the Government take this opportunity to review how we involve TCM practitioners in community preventive healthcare, especially, since acupuncture is also offered in our restructured hospitals?",3,339,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00339
2022-10-05-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, how will compliance and success be measured?

2022-10-05-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, how adequately are our GPs trained in managing chronic diseases? A GP who wants to manage more complex health problems must begin their training from medical school. In big countries like Australia, there may only be one doctor serving one or even a few towns. The GPs there are trained through medical school and postgraduate courses, with the expectation that they will function as the only doctor in the town and would, therefore, be equipped as such, with skills spanning from common ailments to more complex chronic conditions. In Singapore, because of how accessible our tertiary healthcare institutions are, many of our GPs focus on common ailments and function as referrers for more complex and serious conditions.",10,346,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00346
2022-10-05-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, how many GPs are enrolled in our PCNs? This may give some insight on GPs' willingness to participate in Healthier SG.

2022-10-05-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Under Healthier SG, we expect GPs to provide advice on lifestyle and dietary activities but such social prescriptions can involve a longer consultation session and probably over an extended duration of time. In the meantime, GPs still have other patients' ailments to tend to. Can the GP count on the care team to help out or will they have to hire additional staff if they are unable to manage?

In my Budget speech in 2016, I brought up coordinated care, about GPs playing a more prominent role in the overall well-being of our people. Eighty percent of our GPs are in the private sector and only 20% of them are in polyclinics and hospitals handling 80% of our population.",2,369,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00369

The availability of our healthcare records will empower our GPs to make informed care decisions for us. We need to trust our doctors with the data and that the systems that hold our healthcare records are safe from bad actors, hackers and lapses.",5,372,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00372

I am very conscious about children's gadget time. I am even more concerned about my senior residents' gadget time. Many of them have learnt to download movies and dramas and are hooked to them. My volunteers and PA staff work hard to create programmes to draw them out of their homes to have a healthy and active social life. Programmes must be targeted at pre-retirement age so that they will continue their active social life post-retirement.,8,375,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00375

I asked her if she was okay and the tears just rolled. She said, ""Okay. I am tired. I cannot even go to the market for too long.""

The HPB's Healthier Choice Symbol made it easier for her to choose healthier ingredients and the information on how to cook healthier meals have also been useful. She opts for wholegrains such as brown rice and brown rice bee hoon. When making desserts like ""bubur kacang"" for the family, she uses low fat milk instead of coconut milk. In her cooking, she uses healthier oil and includes more vegetables, as well as using healthier cooking methods such as grilling and stir-frying instead of deep frying.

2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] As the saying goes, ""prevention is better than cure"". This wise and well-known quote is apt to describe the Healthier SG White Paper. It also represents a major turning point in our public healthcare policy. Singapore's public healthcare system has always placed a greater emphasis on treatment. From the allocation of Government funds to services provided by civic organisations, there is a clear bias towards the treatment of patients. This is a passive model. Even in the eyes of the general public, to be a specialist is better than a general practitioner. This attitude inadvertently affects the choice of students when they choose their course of study, hence has an impact on our talent supply. It also affects the perception of the public with regard to public healthcare.",2,446,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00446
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Of course, when people are sick, we have to treat and take care of them. Like a parent, the Government should not only provide quality medical care for Singaporeans, but also give subsidies to reduce the financial burden from medical expenses. Against the backdrop of an ageing population, it is even more important for the Government to provide quality and affordable healthcare. However, when people fall ill in their twilight years, they may find it hard to enjoy life even if they own a mountain of wealth. Hence it is often said that health is wealth. Because if you are healthy, you will have the energy to travel around, play with your grandchildren, pursue unfulfilled dreams and scale new heights in life. In this way, seniors will not be counting down to the end of their lives, but will be anticipating every new day.",3,447,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00447
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Of course, from a long-term point of view, preventive public healthcare will only bring benefits. First, although we are a rapidly ageing population, the increase in public healthcare expenditure can be slowed down and the burden on future generations will also be lightened. Second, good health helps to improve our quality of life, and a good quality of life helps to improve our happiness index. Third, a healthy and strong population means a prosperous country. With good health, one need not fear about the future.",4,448,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00448
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Earlier, I heard Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's speech and I have some doubts. I would like to take this opportunity to seek clarifications from him. He talked about listing out consultation fees at private clinics. I believe benchmarking fees against market standards and listing out consultation fees at private clinics are already in practice. Is he looking for greater transparency or better consistency of consultation fees? Second, he talked about MediShield Life. From what I heard he seemed to suggest that more medical services be included in MediShield Life. Can he elaborate on what additional medical services he is thinking of? Today, we are debating the White Paper, does he expect that certain preventive care services be included in MediShield Life? If so, how will that affect the premiums of MediShield Life? How do we help Singaporeans deal with the increase in premiums? Can Assoc Prof Jamus Lim clarify on these points?",5,449,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00449
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"My general feeling after listening to Assoc Prof Lim's speech is that he still plays a greater emphasis on treatment, but the Healthier SG White Paper is focusing on preventive care. I would like to seek his clarification. Does he also agree that the preventive medicine is better than curative medicine? In the long term, I feel that preventive care is a better option.",6,450,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00450
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Now, I would like to return to my original speech. To move Singapore's health focus from treatment to prevention is necessary. However, in my view, the key to realising the vision of the White Paper lies in getting the people's genuine buy in. Bai Juyi once said, ""feel how other people would feel with your own body and heart"". When we rollout Healthier SG, we must pay attention to both the body and mind. Policies play a facilitating role. At present, if we ask Singaporeans whether they should live healthy lives and take preventive care, the answer must be ""yes"". Ask if they support it, the answer will surely be ""yes"" as well. But how important is it to them? And whether they will translate it into action, the answers are not so clear. In fact, unless we are sick, we tend to have the mindset that ""it will not be me"". Health checks or healthy dietary habits are often not on the agenda. Hence, in the White Paper, it is right to emphasise the role of GPs in inculcating good habits among Singaporeans. Building on the existing CHAS network, I hope that all GPs will heed the call and join the Healthier SG initiative to benefit more Singaporeans.",7,451,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00451
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"For these reasons, I support the Healthier SG White Paper. The White Paper's analysis is meticulous and the measures put forward are suitable. But I have two questions. First, as the existing recreational facilities, community partners and health activities in each estate are not uniform, how does the Government intend to work with various Government agencies and social organisations to ensure that each estate has a basic package with sufficient space and budget, customised according to the needs of the estate? For example, in some mature estates, there may be more elderly people living alone who are old, frail and financially disadvantaged. What they need is not just recreational activities, but also social and financial support. How can the Government ensure that every community, whether it is old or new, rich or poor, provides equal services? After all, one can get chronic illnesses regardless of one's status. But one's financial ability affects one's choice in life.",8,452,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00452
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, I am happy to see that the Government agrees with the importance of mental health. In the White Paper, care protocols are mentioned to enhance the consistency of GPs in the care of chronic illnesses. I hope that the Government will also step up its efforts in the mental health area. Singapore is a high stress environment and mental health cannot be ignored. During the pandemic, many older Singaporeans have become accustomed to staying at home or avoiding the crowds because they have lived at home for a long time. This inevitably aggravates the psychological challenges that they face. So, I think mental health is an issue that we have to deal with sooner rather than later. Can the Government introduce mental health care with the ""three highs"" care protocols?",9,453,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00453
2022-10-05-T-017,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Overall, the intention of the Healthier SG White Paper is clear and should be supported.",10,454,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00454

2022-10-05-T-017,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"The first was Ms Tin suggested that I was saying that more fees should be published, right? This is not, in fact, what I said. I appreciate that I spoke quickly. What I said was that we should publish more of a multiplier of existing charges. If anything, I think that we do not need to publish all the fees in doctors offices, per se. We should publish it as a matter of course in literature, but rather, we should allow the multiplier of fees to be published so that the consumer is aware of how much more or less expensive their doctor may be relative to the benchmark.",2,457,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00457
2022-10-05-T-017,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"The second point, Ms Tin mentioned about what I was suggesting be included into MediShield Life in terms of procedures that were not covered. Again, I think she may have misheard what I said. What I said instead was that MediShield Life should be a lot more proactive in negotiating for price setting. And that is important because MediShield Life is, in fact, one of the more prominent insurers in the existing market.",3,458,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00458
2022-10-05-T-017,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Finally, I should clarify that while I did focus my speech indeed on elements of cost pricing from the supply side, I also explained why I did so. The reason is preventative care – which is, of course, the focus of this Motion – is insufficient if we wish to contain costs. We have to address the demand side, in terms of how much people are demanding medical care but also address concerns from the supply side, those insurers as well as medical providers that are providing said care.",4,459,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00459

2022-10-05-T-017,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"First, with regards to my suggestion of tax on unhealthy food, he asked for specifics. And also, the second part is whether imposing such a tax adheres to the spirit of the White Paper.",2,485,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00485
2022-10-05-T-017,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"As to the specifics of the tax, one specific example would be the sugar tax that exists in many countries and cities, including places like UK, France, India, Thailand, Malaysia and in certain cities in USA, it is is quite common. And a few months ago, a research that was funded by the World Health Organization came up with a report that examined the effect of this tax on the countries or regions that have in place this sugar tax. And it was found that it decreased demand for sugared drinks by 15%. So, it has been proven to be effective.",3,486,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00486

So, if the Member disagrees, perhaps, he can share why he feels that it does not.

2022-10-05-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The principle is not wrong – having a ""sin"" tax is the policy of this Government. When it is cigarettes, it is something that is harmful, we do tax it. Carbon, we tax it. We do tax sins. The question is sugar causes diabetes, should we tax sugar? The Member, Ms Hazel Poa, has suggested a sugar tax. I assume if you extend it further, you can also tax salt or oil, for example. We are reluctant to do this.",2,490,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00490
2022-10-05-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, it affects a lot of people. Sugar is commonly consumed by so many people and so, you will add cost. And also, we consider the equity of the tax. There is equity involved. Because sugar is found in fruit juices, sugarcane, the pearls in bubble tea. So, you start to make such comparison, it is not going to be so easy. Therefore, the implementation will be complicated. Which is why for MOH, we decided against it – notwithstanding other countries having imposed sugar tax. We use labelling and regulation.",3,491,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00491

Once we announced Nutri-Grade A to D, if you have high sugar content for canned beverages, you will be graded D, immediately, the beverage companies reformulated.

2022-10-05-T-017,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"During the NTUC's recent #EveryWorkerMatters Conversation, many workers raised concerns about the steady creep in healthcare costs.

2022-10-05-T-017,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),Employers too are affected by the rise in healthcare costs for their ageing workforce as they have to spend more for their employees' medical benefits. An unhealthy workforce also reduces workplace productivity.,6,499,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00499
2022-10-05-T-017,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"According to the United States' Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, some job roles can result in workers becoming more susceptible to chronic illnesses. For example, four out of the 10 most costly health conditions for US employers, which include chest pains, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attack, could be attributed to work stress and physical inactivity caused by prolonged hours of sitting at the work desk. This relationship between certain job roles and chronic health conditions is unlikely to be unique to the United States.",7,500,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00500
2022-10-05-T-017,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"The Labour Movement is therefore heartened that Healthier SG will help to make healthcare more affordable through  one, subsidies on health screenings and vaccinations; two, waiver of the co-payment requirement when using MediSave for chronic care management; and three, introduction of the new Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) drug subsidy tier for a whitelist of chronic disease management drugs to ensure that medications for chronic illnesses are made affordable.",8,501,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00501

2022-10-05-T-017,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, as we shift away from transactional and episodic care, employers should also shift away from requiring medical certificates and provide workers some sick leave without MC. This will reduce the need to visit the doctor just to get an MC and reduce medical bills too. While some employers are already doing this – for example, workers in our healthcare clusters are given up to three days of non-MC sick leave – I urge all employers to do the same.",16,509,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00509

One in four citizens are expected to be aged 65 and above by 2030, up from one in six today. While our life expectancy is one of the highest in the world at 85 years, our health-adjusted life expectancy is 75 years. This means that on average, we spend about 10 years in ill health. Our chronic disease prevalence rate has also risen.

From young, Singaporeans participate in activities in schools, such as physical education (PE), and go on to participate in programmes and activities in their workplaces and in the community.

2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The general practitioners or GPs are critical to the success of Healthier SG. After the release of the Healthier SG White Paper, I managed to communicate with a few GPs, including GPs who are practising in the Nanyang division. In general, the GPs are very supportive of Healthier SG.",2,600,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00600
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"While some GPs operate in residential areas and in clearly family clinics, others practise at the workplace. Those GPS who practise at the workplace are concerned that some residents or many residents would not appoint them as the primary family doctor, especially those residents above 60 years old, who are not working. How would MOH address this perceived inequality?",3,601,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00601
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"On the other hand, some popular GPs may be overwhelmed if too many patients want them to be their primary family doctor and they have to turn people away. Minister Ong alluded to this in his opening speech. For Singaporeans, securing a family doctor should not be a competition.",4,602,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00602
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"As such, I would like to ask what is maximum number of patients each family doctor can accept? What is the set of criteria which doctors can use to decide whether to accept or reject existing and new patients under Healthier SG? For instance, would they take into account factors like whether the patient had visited the clinic before, or how far away the patient lives from the clinic, or on a first-come-first-served basis? What exactly are the factors they would have to take into account and is that a priority?",5,603,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00603
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Meanwhile, one GP, who is an owner-doctor running his own clinic has requested me to ask if it is compulsory for all family doctors to join the Primary Care Network (PCN). Such GPs also have questions on the need to be qualified as a family physician. Referring to page 42 of the Healthier SG White Paper, it states that each GP clinic must have at least one family doctor to be registered as a family physician within seven years of the launch of Healthier SG. Thus, I would like to ask, does it mean that the family clinic with only doctor, the sole doctor would have to be qualified as a family physician? If so, this may have profound implications for family clinics run by solo doctors.",6,604,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00604
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"If GPs are to oversee the end-to-end journey of caring for a patient, it would be helpful if they can work with partners to deliver this care.",7,605,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00605
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"According to an article from the Harvard Medical School, such GPs, who are also called primary care physicians, work in teams to keep patients at the centre of all diagnostic and treatment activities. These teams often comprise medical assistants, nurses, pharmacists and social workers.",8,606,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00606
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Likewise, in the Netherlands where the GP is the central figure in Dutch primary care, GPs employ salaried nurses and primary care psychologists, who can even provide mental health services. The typical practice size is approximately 2,200 patients per full-time working GP and over 95% of the citizens are registered with one GP that they have chosen. Chronic care management is coordinated through care groups, which are mostly GP networks. These care groups coordinate care from multiple service providers for certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.",9,607,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00607
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Would MOH envisage the formation of such GP networks in Singapore? If so, would such networks be coordinated by the respective three health clusters?",10,608,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00608
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Outside of the clinic, there are many touch points and community engagement opportunities with members of the public. I heard from Minister Masagos that the healthcare cluster will coordinate with community partners and GPs to provide healthy activities for the residents. And to this end, as a Member of Parliament taking care of the Nanyang Division of West Coast GRC, I would be happy to leverage on my community partners to work with the healthcare clusters and the GPs in Nanyang to provide healthy lifestyle activities for the residents.",11,609,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00609
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"As with any change, it would take time for residents to embrace Healthier SG. Preventive care requires more commitment from people to live more healthily, commit to advice from their doctors and spend time on regular health screenings. Many Nanyang residents I met and have spoken to after the release of the Healthier SG White Paper are very supportive of Healthier SG but they have also raised some concerns. Let me continue in Mandarin.",12,610,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00610
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Many residents in Nanyang support Healthyier SG, but they also have some questions. Let me share an example. Mdm Tan, who is in her sixties, has been seeing a doctor at the Teo clinic near her home since young. She has just changed her job, and the clinic is not on the company's list of designated clinics. Hence, Mdm Tan cannot claim medical fees from the company for the cost of seeing the doctor at the Teo Clinic. Mdm Tan was glad to hear about Healthier SG, and wanted to appoint Dr Teo from the Teo clinic as her designated doctor, so that she could receive free vaccinations and highly subsidised pills for the ""three highs"". For a common cold, Mdm Tan still needs to go to company-designated clinics. This situation is just like what the White Paper has described on page 24. If Mdm Tan has a choice, she would prefer to go to the Teo Clinic which she is familiar with whenever she falls ill, just like what the White Paper has recommended. I hope MOH can solve this dilemma.",13,611,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00611
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Another important aspect of Healthier SG is to encourage Singaporeans to take part in more activities that are good for their health, such as Zumba, brisk walking in parks and gardening. To date, most of these activities are only attractive to women. Many men prefer to drink in coffee shops, eat and chitchat for a long time. It seems that we need to mobilise our men and entice them to move from drinking tables to table tennis and from eating to growing vegetables. While this is not MOH's strength, it is an important factor in Healthier SG. I hope the Minister will think about it and invest more in this area.",14,612,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00612
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"(In English)  Next, I would like to touch on another very important topic, which is the funding. Minister Ong had indicated that it would cost about $1 billion over the next three to four years for IT support and other one-off costs to bring the GPs on board Healthier SG. At the same time, the recurring cost of running Healthier SG will amount to $400 million a year, including the service fee for the GPs.",15,613,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00613
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"As mentioned earlier, healthy activities for the residents as coordinated by the respective health clusters are a very important component of Healthier SG. I would like to ask Minister Ong, how much of the $400 million budget will be allocated for organising healthy activities and nudging residents to engage in such activities?",16,614,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00614
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Earlier, I heard from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam that they will make Healthy 365 as a very key component of the entire Healthier SG. But we know that there are many other apps that are very popular with the residents. For example, there is LumiHealth. So, how would Healthy 365 interface with those apps that are very popular right now, like LumiHealth, so that they can be more coordinated and benefit more residents?",17,615,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00615
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Ultimately, we can take inspiration from what is being done in other countries for preventive healthcare.",18,616,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00616
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"A research study of primary care physicians in 10 countries including Australia, Norway, United Kingdom and Switzerland showed how patients that are managed by one primary care physician are able to view information from their medical records, and can even e-mail their doctors. While this could prove quite onerous for our GPs, it would certainly go a long way in building trust between patients and their doctors.",19,617,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00617
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"In conclusion, I would like to quote an advice by Dr Chuang Wei Ping, an elected member of the Singapore Medical Council and a popular GP in the Nanyang division. Dr Chuang said, “People want to live a fuller live, rather than a longer life.” “People want to live a fuller live, rather than a longer life.”",20,618,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00618
2022-10-05-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Currently, Singaporeans' life expectancy is close to 85 years but they spend more than 10 years in ill health. With Healthier SG, we hope to reduce the number of years spent in ill health. This is possible if all Singaporeans, all GPs, all Government officials and all community partners are ready to make Healthier SG as a priority for a better Singapore. I support the Motion.

In the course of the debate, I have heard hon Members Ms Joan Pereira, Ms Hany Soh and Mr Yip Hon Weng also speak on TCM and how it interfaces with the Healthier SG White Paper. In my speech today, I will make three suggestions to bridge TCM and complementary or alternative medicine as important community partners of a healthier SG.",3,623,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00623
2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In July this year, I asked the Minister for Health in a written Parliamentary Question how TCM practitioners would be integrated into the Ministry's Healthier SG plans. Minister Ong replied and I quote  ""Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners are important stakeholders, especially given their emphasis on holistic and long-term care. However, unlike Western doctors, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners are not tightly regulated by MOH. The standard of care delivery varies widely and we will therefore not be able to take the same approach as we have taken for Western doctors.""",4,624,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00624

Globally, under the Beijing Declaration adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2008, Traditional Chinese Medicine was recognised as having an important role in the improvement of public health.

The pilot did not cover acupuncture used to treat other pain indications and other forms of traditional complementary and alternative medicine offered at public healthcare institutions. However, the Ministry stated that it would review the expansion of the pilot to other settings in the longer term, taking into account learnings and data from this pilot.

2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, Sir, my first suggestion is for the Government to consider extending the use of MediSave for more TCM procedures and alternative therapies that have a proven role in the management of one's general health and, more pertinently, in the prevention of chronic diseases. This expansion should also see the inclusion of certified TCM practitioners who can be allowed to offer such approved procedures in their TCM clinics outside public healthcare institutions. In order to prevent abuse, a fixed and audited list of procedures and caps to limit the fees that can be charged for such procedures ought to be considered. Additional subsidies can also be extended to Pioneer and Merdeka card holders for these procedures, many of whom resort to TCM as an important source of primary care.",16,636,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00636

2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, MOH should look into the cost of alternative medicine that substantively produces the same clinical outcomes as medicines and drugs disbursed by our public healthcare institutions. For example, Fybogel, which is commonly dispensed for constipation, can cost around $20 on the shelf without subsidies, whereas psyllium husk, which confers similar, if not identical, benefits, can be purchased from Little India and even NTUC supermarkets at under $3.",18,638,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00638

In similar vein and with a view to better manage costs, a review of commonly prescribed medicine which substantially produces the same clinical outcomes as complementary medicine should be undertaken on a longer-term basis. It would be useful to understand if the Ministry or a relevant body like the Health Sciences Authority currently carries out such comparisons of clinical outcomes between Western and alternative medicine with the view to lower overall healthcare costs.",19,639,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00639

2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In this light, would the Ministry consider whether there is scope for such rehabilitation or physiotherapy to be undertaken at TCM clinics by TCM practitioners? Such rehabilitation is not usually just more affordable than physiotherapy sessions at many private and public healthcare facilities, but the convenience of having such options for Singaporeans within one's neighbourhood and perhaps right under one's block can ensure that patients complete their rehabilitation and live healthier and more mobile lives.",21,641,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00641

2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, late last year, a Straits Times article reported that the Government's feedback channel, REACH, discovered that many seniors were reluctant to get their COVID-19 vaccines due to and I quote, ""advice from their doctors, mostly traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners who are unsure of what advice to give"". In response to this, MOH arranged to meet all TCM practitioners to explain why vaccination was critical.",23,643,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00643
2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, while TCM and other alternative therapies have not been covered in any substantive detail in the White Paper, it is clear that TCM practitioners do not have a small footprint in the mindshare of Singaporeans when it comes to our health, particularly in the heartlands. Like Healthier SG, prevention of long-term diseases is a core belief of TCM and complementary medicine. And this does not start in one's senior years. Their treatment philosophy places an acute focus on prevention before a disease arises. They advance the view that one's lifestyle is intimately related to health, which can be improved through effective mental health management, rest, a good diet and interventions based on a person's specific physical conditions, amongst others. By watching such indicators, one is well on his or her way to good health, regardless which economic strata of society one belongs to.",24,644,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00644
2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Indeed, the White Paper lists a number of community partners, such as AIC, Sport Singapore, the People's Association (PA) and the National Parks Board (NPB), that will empower residents to chart their own journey towards healthy and active lives. In our journey to live more healthy lives, I would suggest that we should not underestimate the wide reach of the local sinsehs in our neighbourhoods. MOH should tap on them to help share healthy living tips and preventive healthcare strategies, not just to our seniors. And MOH should not rule out subsidising TCM practitioners in this endeavour, subject to their contributions towards objective criteria under Healthier SG. Such an approach would also be consistent with the aim of successive Ministers of Health who had hoped to integrate Western medicine and TCM and alternative medicine as far as practicable, even as both branches of medicine operate in different cultural and professional milieus. While progress in this regard appears to have been fitful so far, Healthier SG provides a new-found opportunity for TCM and alternative medicine to play a more active role in the primary healthcare space and in preventive healthcare.",25,645,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00645
2022-10-05-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Sir, just like family doctors, many Singaporeans have been going to the same TCM practitioners for decades. For some, the reasons behind this may well be behavioural, peace of mind and more comfort dealing with a TCM practitioner. The Government is on record to say that TCM practitioners are an important stakeholder in Healthier SG. The Ministry should consider concrete plans and strategies to include them in the country's strategic shift towards preventive healthcare as Healthier SG is fleshed out and operationalised in the months and years ahead.",26,646,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00646

We got doctors and nurses from TTSH to review the health status of every senior under our care and to come up with a personal health plan. By health plan, it means more than just doing monitoring their vitals or ensuring medical compliance. It also includes social prescription, getting them to join in regular exercises and activities, getting them to eat healthy meals together and getting them to join in the kampung downstairs. These social prescriptions were delivered by a few staff and seniors were given micro-jobs.

He relied extensively on alternative medicine. One day, Uncle Ong injured his toes and it turned gangrene soon after.

We feel this way because we understand the possibilities. In fact, we have started creating our Kebun Baru local action plan for healthy longevity, that we hope to partner with NHG on. We will grow as many exercise and wellness groups as we can and build bridges between them and NHG. We will create a single service directory on how to care for our seniors and we will share it with all our local partners including family doctors. We will join Ang Mo Kio GRC’s efforts to set up a dedicated helpline to serve the seniors. We will improve our existing local efforts on dementia, palliative care, assisted living and we will build up support groups for stroke and cancer. We will reach out to the Centre for Healthy Longevity, so that our residents can benefit from longevity interventions as soon as possible.

Enrolment is tagged to the clinic, to enable service delivery even when a specific doctor is away or unavailable. After enrolment, residents can still visit other clinics if needed. Residents can also choose to change their enrolled clinic. For example, if your doctor leaves the clinic to join another group, you have the option to switch and enrol with your doctor's new clinic. Others may prefer the convenience of staying with the same clinic in the same location. Ms Ang also asked if three generations could enroll to the same doctor as well. This is ideal. But for now, we have to consider the capacity of GPs for the enrolment process, especially early in the roll out of Healthier SG.

We also hope that healthcare IT colleagues see the contribution they make and the fulfilling career they can have in transforming our system, caring for our society.",33,713,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00713
2022-10-05-T-017,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Ms Ng Ling Ling suggested that more comprehensive health screening is needed as we move towards preventive health and Mr Abdul Samad further suggested more MediSave utilisation for this. We take guidance from the recommendations of the Screening Test Review Committee. This guidance is based on scientific evidence to ensure that screening tests are safe, effective and suitable for population level screening, means it applies to everyone across the population. We need to strike a balance, to balance the practice good preventive care, but consider what the test involves, without going overboard. In some cases, some of the tests, some of the screening tools, are better applied to targeted population. It may be better for some cases to take a calculated, risk-based approach, to offer tests that are effective and easy to administer to high-risk groups. One example is what we are doing for those aged 50 and above, such as with the 2-day Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) which is for colorectal cancer.",34,714,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00714
2022-10-05-T-017,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"So, there are some tests which the science suggests we should apply it to the entire population and there are some tests which the science suggests we should apply to targeted population. We will continue to review emerging scientific evidence on these screening tests as well as the effectiveness of our financing models. Fundamentally, access will not be denied to those who need it.",35,715,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00715
2022-10-05-T-017,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Ms Janet Ang asked about regular eye and dental screening. These are important, we must look after our teeth and have our eyes checked, and most of us do so. The screening processes and tools are less appropriate as a mass exercise for all under the population approach for Healthier SG and again, are more suitable as targeted effort for certain groups of Singaporeans.",36,716,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00716
2022-10-05-T-017,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Healthier SG is a multi-year effort, we will continue to review and include other necessary care protocols in future. Meanwhile, to reassure Members of the House, regular oral health and eye screening programmes are already easily and readily available as a routine service in many settings, and we will continue to offer these. For example, Project Silver Screen conducts check-ups for seniors at community locations for age-related decline in vision, oral health and hearing, so that they do not have to visit a clinic or hospital, and so that timely interventions can be provided. Likewise, we would like to assure Mr Dennis Tan that there are already similar preventive dental health programmes in place.",37,717,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00717

2022-10-05-T-017,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Finally, let me address mental health and well-being, a topic important to many we engaged during our public consultation. Several members such as Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms He Ting Ru, Dr Wan Rizal, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Dennis Tan have also raised this. Good health is also about good mental health. The current planned interventions under the first phase of Healthier SG will support mental well-being. People have asked when will we start to look at mental well-being? Yesterday – actually, years ago! The interventions we already planned under Healthier SG, starting with our initial emphasis on eating well and regular exercise, will have a positive effect on mental health. But allow me to also highlight what we have put in place over the last few years to promote mental health and well-being, even before Healthier SG.",39,719,2022-10-05-T-017-S-00719

To improve access to community mental health services, we developed Community Outreach Teams (CREST). We have the redeveloped Alexandra Hospital coming up, which will provide psychiatric services.

Maybe I will start with – we seem to have this mood here where we talk about who made what speeches in the past. Let me give my version. [Laughter.]",2,734,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00734
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I came into MOH about a year and a half ago, what struck me was the tremendous amount of groundwork that was done by my predecessor in laying a preventive health infrastructure, the IT system, the three clusters and all the medical protocols. So, I walked into a workplan seminar. As the new Health Minister, I had to speak to the senior doctors and management. At the workplan seminar, it was very daunting. I discussed with three very learned persons, our three Director of Medical Services (DMS), Prof Kenneth Mak, Prof Benjamin Ong and Prof Tan Chorh Chuan. I had in-depth discussion with them, discussed what was the next phase of healthcare and I think we zoomed in on preventive care.",3,735,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00735
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The good thing is, so much groundwork has been laid. On 23 May 2021, I think, I made my first speech in MOH. We talked about two topics. One was COVID-19 – Living with COVID-19 and second was preventive care, that was when Healthier SG, was first talked about. But really, thank you to the several Ministers before me and the whole team who laid so much groundwork.",4,736,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00736
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Then then we had COVID-19 closures and all that. We did not have many events until December. I thank Mr Pritam Singh for reminding me. I got invited in December to an event by the TCM community and that is why I spoke to them, with the indication that if we focus on preventive care, I think it is an impetus that we can make a breakthrough and feature TCM in preventive care. And that was how the thinking first started.",5,737,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00737
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"And my last two speeches about TCM, I made quite a few TCM speeches, they are all in Chinese. The coverage has been uneven, so it is good that I have this opportunity now to explain it in English. The two speeches I last made was quite recent, Mr Patrick Tay was there, in one of the events in September last month. In summary, this was what I have been telling the TCM community and what we have been doing.",6,738,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00738
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"One, MOH has always recognised the tremendous value of TCM and the benefits they have brought to the community. I specifically always mention, during COVID-19 – and the Leader of the Opposition mentioned this as well – I personally wrote to our TCM clinicians to say  ""Please advise your patients to take the vaccines."" They were a great help and really helped us moved the needle in getting heartlanders to take the vaccine.",7,739,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00739
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But, I also explained, we must recognise that Western medicines and TCM, they evolve very differently throughout history. They are two separate systems, complete systems with their own disciplines and their own know-how. They may intersect at some point, they may overlap, but you cannot make one to be like the other. It is not possible. They are two complete holistic systems.",8,740,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00740
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Take for example, you ask a western doctor, ""how do you balance the five elements of a human body to keep him healthy?"" Most western doctors would profess they would not know. We have doctors in the House, I do not think you would profess that you know. If you ask a TCM doctor, ""This patient need a life-saving, urgent operation, can you replace it with herbal medication?"" They would say ""No, go for the operation."" Most TCM practitioners I know, would say that too. I think they respect each other's space, their strengths and their disciplines.",9,741,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00741
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"When it comes to regulation, there is a fundamental difference as well. Western medicine is a lot about research, clinical evidence, efficacy, safety. You get the data, then, the drug, the treatment can be approved. It is tightly regulated and by law.",10,742,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00742
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"TCM is passed down from generations, great-great-great-great grandfather took that and passed down to great-great-great grandfather. Culturally, traditionally, they trust that herbal medicine. And you ask for clinical evidence? They do not have. You want to go for MediSave? Today's rules mean it must be a medicine, it must be certified by HSA with clinical data. For TCM, that is hard to come by.",11,743,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00743
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"What TCM is very strong in is preventive care. More than 2,000 years ago there was already the saying  养生三法：“饮食有节、起居有常、不妄作劳.” Very hard to translate, but let me try. Even the literal translation does not capture the full meaning. It means there are three key aspects to health  you eat not just in moderation, but 饮食有节 means you eat what your body requires, you go according to the seasons. 起居有常 means you have a healthy daily routine that follows the rhythm of the day, the month and the year probably, and not to over-exert your body, heart and mind.",12,744,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00744
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, in the area of preventive health, that is where I think Western medicine and TCM share a common understanding. You would notice in my opening speech, I have a symmetry, where I talk about preventive care and how the other side also has been emphasising on it. Both disciplines believe that early management of risk factors and disease can stave off problems and complications later on in life. Therefore, I believe, when we focus on preventive care under Healthier SG, we hope TCM can play a role.",13,745,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00745
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"While we work that out, in the mean time, we encourage TCM practitioners to continue to do what you are good at, advise the patients to take care of their health, pick up good habits, live healthily and take care of their health holistically.",14,746,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00746
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But like I said in my Parliamentary reply, TCM is self-regulated, with varying standards of practice. So, over the last year, MOH and the TCM community have established two workgroups. They work on issues such as enhancing TCM clinical training and improving career development. And once completed, this can be a basis to explore how to involve TCM in support of Healthier SG. But I do not think, as one Member suggested, I do not think we should impose the regulation of Western medicine on TCM. I think self-regulation for something that is traditional and cultural, would be more appropriate. But we need to strengthen that self-regulation.",15,747,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00747
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We have recently also finalised the succession plan of the Chairman of the TCM Board. This is MOH's partner in the TCM community. Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has been Chairman for I think at least three terms or more, a lot of contributions. The incoming Chairman will be Dr Teo Ho Pin, another familiar colleague of ours. He has taken up the Chairmanship with gusto. I have had several discussions with him. He understands the big shoes he has to fill, MOH's position and thinking, especially in the context of Healthier SG, and I think he understands his task as the TCM Board Chairman. Once we can feature TCM in Healthier SG, then the suggestions that the Leader of the Opposition has put forth, I think will be considered. And there will be a certain natural forward movement in our policy thinking.",16,748,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00748
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I just have one last thing before I move to another topic. Mr Pritam Singh mentioned psyllium and fybogel. I think it is the same thing. It is not that one is Western medicine and one is TCM, one is funded and one is not – I am not wrong. There are doctors in the House, please correct me. I think it is the same thing. Psyllium is the seed for fibre supplements, fybogel is essentially psyllium with a brand, called Fybogel. Both are not medicine, both are dietary supplements, fibre supplements. But like all things sold in the polyclinic, including the gauze used to dress your wounds, they will all be subsidised, including supplements. But there are doctors in the House; so, please correct if I am wrong.",17,749,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00749
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me move to the next topic, crowded GPs, raised by several Members. Dr Tan Wu Meng, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, all expressed concerns that if GPs become very popular, residents can get squeezed out by the huge demand. I tried to explain some of this in my opening speech that we will try our best to manage this. We will ask GPs to set a limit on number of residents they can enrol. How many will depend on the clinic and the doctor's own judgement, how many more can he take. So, it will differ from clinic to clinic.",18,750,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00750
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We are also implementing enrolment in phases; we will prompt residents to enrol with their usual GPs, the dropdown list, your most frequented GP will be first; and we will encourage residents to enrol early and not wait.",19,751,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00751
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I take comfort that we are discussing this because we are worried the demand will be overwhelming. It is in a way, a good problem. It is better than if the feedback comes back as, ""We think nobody will enrol"". That would be a bigger problem.",20,752,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00752
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But if GPs are to over time accept enrolment from the entire population and help keep them healthy, they have got to shift out of some current load. And I am glad that a couple of Members have given a good suggestion. Mr Melvin Yong suggested for employers not to insist on workers producing medical certificates (MCs) whenever they are sick. Many common ailments like cough and cold can be managed with more rest, drinking more water and perhaps some off-the-shelf, over the counter medication, including TCM medication. Ironically, the disease where this is most practised now is COVID-19.",21,753,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00753
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But if we insist we want to see a GP, we queue up and see the family doctor in order to get an MC – today, a lot of people practice that – but actually it is not the best use of the doctor’s precious time and resources.",22,754,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00754
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),Many employers already do not insist on MCs for COVID-19. Mr Melvin Yong mentioned that our healthcare clusters today accept up to three days of sick leave without the need to produce an MC; the Civil Service grants officers up to two days for mild conditions like cough and cold. I hope this can become a prevalent practice.,23,755,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00755
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me talk about drug prices. Mr Gerald Giam asked a series of questions about our effort to substantively remove difference in drug prices, between GP clinics and polyclinics for residents enroled in Healthier SG. As I said in my opening speech, the basis of subsidy for polyclinics and for CHAS in GP clinics are different. The former, which is polyclinic, takes into account age. But for CHAS in GP clinics, a major factor for consideration is income.",24,756,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00756
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, we cannot remove the differences up to the last cent and for the higher-income households, the difference may well remain in dollars. But parity of drug prices is an important concern, told to us by many residents when we did our consultation. And we will try our best to make sure there is drug price parity, especially for the lower income.",25,757,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00757
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me move on to the next subject which is delivering outcomes and KPIs. A number of Members talked about KPIs and outcomes and there was an exchange between Mr Gerald Giam and Ms Mariam Jaafar yesterday. Of course, we have to measure outcomes and set targets. That is why we listed short-, medium-, long-term KPIs in the White Paper. The work has just begun. Healthier SG is a dynamic multi-year transformation exercise. There will be twists, turns and uncertainties along the way. MOH is having extensive discussions with clinicians and other stakeholders to set out the technical definitions and our approach to data sharing and measuring these outcomes. And from there, we will establish the baselines of various indicators and then, determine what targets we want to achieve and by when.",26,758,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00758
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"While it is important to measure outcomes and targets, those who have run organisations before will know that this is not straightforward. I used to be involved in workers' training, so I interacted a lot with HR practitioners. And HR practitioners always lament – and this is not just for Singapore, it is the whole world. They always lament employees are over-managed but under led. The unions always say that.",27,759,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00759
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Because if you are manager and you are in the middle of a big change management exercise, you will likely instinctively say, what are the targets, let us measure the targets, whatever gets measured, gets done. That is what the manager always says. Ms Hazel Poa went further to say, let us measure the targets achieved by the GPs. And if they do not achieve, clawback the service fee. But as Dr Tan Yia Swam cautioned, it is important for GPs and MOH to work together, for GPs to feel that they are integral part of this change. And I agree with Dr Tan.",28,760,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00760
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Ms Mariam Jaafar, my colleague from Sembawang, and an experienced management consultant, immediately raised a red flag.

2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But what will a leader do? A leader that is driving the change will have a different starting point.

Then, it is very simple for the doctors. Number one, either I do not join Healthier SG; or two, I join, but I cherry-pick the healthy residents. So, the way we look at KPIs, always, you are able to differentiate the leaders from the managers.",32,764,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00764

We just did not feature them in the White Paper under Healthier SG.",33,765,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00765
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"There are many examples. One, all the community measures taken to help resuscitate out-of-hospital cardiac arrests by making defibrillators available in the community, training members of the public to perform CPR, alerting them through apps, that there is a cardiac arrest nearby. And so far, the survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has improved by 10 times – 2% to 22% over the years.",34,766,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00766

The idea is to review the patient's condition early within two weeks. This has resulted in a reduction of the 30-day re-admission rate from 14.3% to 9.6%. There are many such examples and I hope Ms Mariam Jaafar and the House will be comforted that our clinicians are always thinking of better ways to deliver better clinical outcomes.,35,767,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00767
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me now comment about capitation. A few Members have raised the issue of capitation. I agree with Members on the benefits of capitation funding, but we are doing it step-by-step and carefully. I explained how we are doing it at the GP level during my opening speech by extending them a standard base fee per enrolled resident. So, it is loosely a capitation payment.",36,768,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00768

2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, they receive fixed capitated budgets for residents of different age bands. For the very young, they have to do a lot more work, at a higher capitation rate. Young adults will have the lowest capitation rates and as you get older, as you need to pay more attention to their healthcare, capitation rate goes up again. So, age bands are a reasonable proxy for both workload as well as health risks.",38,770,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00770

Today, we fund them through workload – same formula – but we can capitate their budget. So, a palliative care provider can receive a standard based fee for each palliative patient they take care of and then they decide which services are in the best interest of each patient, whether they should go to inpatient hospice care, home care or day care.

Ten years ago, ITE, Polytechnics and Universities in Singapore took in about 1,500 nursing students a year.

If we maintain that number while cohort sizes shrink, the percentage will drift up to maybe 5% of each cohort. That means that for every 20 local students you see in a class, one will be trained to become a nurse and they are applying. So, healthcare has a very fair share of the local talent pool, considering there are so many sectors vying for local talent.",53,785,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00785

If we look at local nurses, the normal annual attrition rate every year is about 6.4%, which is not high by any industry standard. In 2020, when the pandemic struck, it went down to 5.4% because many of our nurses who were planning to retire or resign, in the face of the pandemic, decided to stay and fight. In 2021, there was a slight rebound to 7.4%. In 2022, this year, so far, the numbers have reverted to that of normal years. There was no mass exodus of local nurses. These are the numbers.

This is where there is record high attrition, at least, over past few years. We know the main reason, and Dr Tan Yia Swam talked about it, which is that the pandemic has increased the demand for nurses all over the world and our foreign nurses are being poached by other countries.

2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Remember, healthcare is one sector that is directly affected by our demographic changes. An expanding aged population needs more healthcare and more healthcare manpower. A shrinking young population limits the number of new local talents that we can bring into healthcare.

2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I visited Block 115 that Mr Henry Kwek talked about. It is not run on a big budget, a lot of passionate volunteers, we all know who got involved, but it is doing such heavy lifting and making such a huge difference to the seniors living in that block. I came across this piece of research, which estimated that the health impact of loneliness for a senior is equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.",91,823,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00823
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We estimate that today, 97% of our seniors above 65 can either live independently or with some help in the community. We must maintain or improve that share and not inadvertently give them the equivalent of 15 cigarettes a day, and weaken their health and ability to live independently.",92,824,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00824
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For the large majority of seniors, what they need most is social care, more than healthcare. The way to deliver that is to enable ageing in communities. We will need a range of solutions to anchor ageing in communities. These include building more Community Care Apartments that Second Minister Masagos Zulkifli talked about, on releasing land for private assisted-living facilities. But the greatest asset for managing ageing is actually right before us – and that is our HDB estates. Most estates already have ample shared spaces for interaction and activities, you got your void deck, your coffeeshop, your supermarket, your RC centre, our Eldercare Centre, your community clubs. We did not specifically build them as infrastructure to support ageing, but they are extremely valuable in our ageing society.",93,825,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00825
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),And that is why MOH is rapidly expanding our network of Eldercare Centres to activate these existing spaces and create more shared spaces and social networks for seniors. We are working closely with AIC to provide training opportunities for our centres to take on an expanded role under Healthier SG.,94,826,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00826
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As a social worker told me, a very effective initiative is to simply bring the seniors to that shared space to cook and enjoy a meal together and once they eat together, they socialise, they start doing different kinds of activities together. There is no risk of forgetting to switch off your stove and we will definitely improve the way the Eldercare Centres work.",95,827,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00827

2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me conclude. Some countries may place a stronger emphasis on just one of the three systems or organise them in a way that they end up working in silo. For example, Japan, as a super-ageing society, has a great focus on aged and institutional care. The US acute care system is state-driven, but public health is driven at the federal level.",99,831,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00831

And they often have many medical conditions, with many, many follow-ups.",3,840,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00840

First step, make sure they stick to their medication; take their medication; gradually, they improve; then, give them better food, social connections with nutrition and confidence interacting with people; they actually become better, even though they are in their 80s.

Just a minor point to clarify the query the Minister raised about the particular product I was referring to, psyllium husk. I think Minister will understand why I had some trouble when I identify the name it is marketed under because the box says, Telephone Brand (Sat-Isabgol) Psyllium Husk. And so this product is produced in Gujarat, that means, as the Minister said, substantively the same product as Fybogel.

2022-10-05-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I have one clarification for the Minister for Health. I would like to ask, of the $1 billion start-up funds that the Minister mentioned and potentially, $400 million recurrent funds, to support this whole initiative, how will it be broadly, allocated to the stakeholders in this whole ecosystem that need to make this work, especially for the GPs that we know have to do a lot of the heavy lifting, as well as the residents who have to feel the incentive to take ownership of their health?",2,851,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00851
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I do not have the numbers with me but of the $1 billion, slightly over $1 billion, there is a chunk for the central IT system, there is a chunk to upgrade the capabilities and IT capabilities of GPs, there is a chunk to upgrade or build up capabilities within the clusters in order to be regional health managers, there is a chunk to do a one-time ramp up of social activities. We are also thinking during enrolment, there could be some incentives – so, there is another chunk there. So, they all add up to over $1 billion .",1,852,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00852
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But what the Member did not ask is also, in terms of recurrent, I did mention recurrent expenses of about $400 million a year. That recurrent amount, about half will go to GPs as their service fee, the capitated service fee, for looking after enrolled patients, and another half will be the additional subsidies for residents, including healthpoints, health screening and so on, which will be free.

2022-10-05-T-019,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"Three big points. One is that my own term here as a Nominated Member of Parliament is limited and will come to an end pretty much soon. I hope that all of you will continue to engage with healthcare workers on the ground, not just doctors to reflect our view. Doctors have always felt that we cannot be a union and sometimes, we are marginalised. As it is, there are 15,000 doctors in Singapore. There are even more nurses around and someone needs to help represent healthcare workers as we forge forward for Healthier SG.",2,856,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00856
2022-10-05-T-019,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),Final point. Oh no. I am so nervous that I have lost my train of thought. I will email Minister Ong separately about my final point.,3,857,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00857
2022-10-05-T-019,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,But you have the opportunity to ask it if you can think of it in the next five minutes.,1,858,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00858

2022-10-05-T-019,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"First, for the Minister, I would like to clarify that KPIs and targets are not synonymous. The White Paper already lists many good KPIs. I am just asking MOH to take the next step to set targets for each KPI so that all stakeholders can work together towards achieving those targets. The best practice in performance management is actually to jointly set KPIs and targets with stakeholders – including doctors of course – and then review them regularly and make adjustments if the conditions change. So, they are not set in stone. But I also do not think that we should start out such a major initiative without any target set.",2,866,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00866
2022-10-05-T-019,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, for the Senior Minister of State, can I clarify with the Senior Minister of State that under the Healthier SG initiative, residents can choose to enrol with polyclinics instead of with GP clinics?",3,867,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00867
2022-10-05-T-019,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And lastly, the Healthier SG White Paper said that MOH will waive the requirement for residents to co-pay part of their bills in cash. Can I clarify that patients will be able to use MediSave to make that co-payment? And will that still be subject to the annual withdrawal limit? Because if this is so, then patients will more likely hit their annual withdrawal limit and thereafter, have to co-pay in cash. So, even if MOH cannot remove the annual withdrawal limit now, can it consider increasing it to, let us say $1,000 a year?",4,868,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00868
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,I will take the first question and then Senior Minister of State Janil will take the next two. I thank the Member for the clarification about KPIs and targets. I think we are now essentially on the same page.,1,869,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00869

2022-10-05-T-019,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker, I just want to make sure that I understood the Minister correctly. When he said that there will be no KPIs for family doctors and no clawback, because that would mean that essentially, if I recall correctly, the amount of money that will be paying in service fee is $400 million a year. Does that mean that we will be paying this $400 million a year, with no accountability?",1,872,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00872
2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Hazel Poa asked a question but she is actually making a statement. She is saying that Healthier SG, $400 million to spend, as I just answered, $400 million is, first, to subsidise residents for health screening, health points and all that. The other half is a service fee to GPs to help us take care of population. And I think she just made a statement to say this is not a good spend of money and if you want it to be spent well, give KPIs and targets to the GPs, and if they do not meet, claw back the fees.",1,873,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00873

Of course, there will be KPIs with targets and we collectively work together to achieve it. At the GP level, they will have certain targets as well. But I do not think we want to treat them like vendors and contractors where if you missed out on a certain KPI, we claw back the fee. They care about the health of the population as much as we do, maybe more than Members in the Chamber.",3,875,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00875

2022-10-05-T-019,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"But the problem is, like in many of the estates, like my constituency Bukit Panjang, we are running out of void deck spaces to build such centres.

2022-10-05-T-019,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"So, can I ask the Minister whether would MOH be open to allowing standalone centres, those outside the void decks, which understandably will cost more to build? But there are some spaces that can actually allow such facility to be built. And specifically, my question is whether MOH will fund this this facility that is outside the void deck centres which may cost a bit more but, because of the space constraint, we have to do that.",3,880,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00880

2022-10-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As I mentioned earlier, if we want to enable ageing in communities, look at what assets is already right in front of us. And visiting Block 115 in Ang Mo Kio is a bit sobering but it is so inspiring too. They are using their void deck spaces. They took back four units or HDB helped take back four units on the second floor. And in that four units, there is a medical centre, there is a therapy centre, there is a place for them to have activities. And so, you create the space. Look around our communities, HDB estates are brilliantly built with lots of shared places. We just need to activate them.",2,882,2022-10-05-T-019-S-00882

2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. Based on the United Nations' report on the world's population ageing in 2019, Singapore will be amongst the top 10 aged countries in the world in 2050 and the second highest country with the largest percentage point increase in the share of older persons in the world.",1,891,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00891
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Life expectancy, as we all discussed earlier, of Singaporeans is going up, and in 2020, it is 83.93 years with healthy life expectancy at 73.7 years for males and 75.2 years for females. With longer life expectancy and healthier life, a senior can continue to work productively and lead a meaningful life for longer.",2,892,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00892

2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Enhancing the employability of seniors aged 55 and above is not a new topic in Singapore. There are a myriad of re-employment, retirement and retention policies, financial support and grants to employ seniors, programmes to redesign work, to hire and support seniors who want to continue to work. The Motion today is to share the voices from surveys and focus group discussions on senior employment and to make recommendations to enable meaningful employment of seniors and the value of the pool of talent for businesses and Singapore.",4,894,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00894
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"To understand senior employability, as part of the PAP Seniors Group's effort to reach out and hear the voices of seniors employed and unemployed, we conducted online surveys and focus group discussions with seniors. This enabled us to learn more about what matters to seniors in their working lives, the opportunities and challenges they face. In October 2021, PAP Seniors Group started our engagement with seniors aged 50 and above through an online survey. Nine hundred and thirty-four seniors of diverse profiles responded to the survey. To gather further insights, we engaged 200 seniors, including the survey respondents who were willing to participate in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to have deeper conversations and dialogues. In addition, we conducted a literature review on senior employability both locally and globally. We examined the matter from the perspectives of seniors and various stakeholders, such as employers and younger workers who work with seniors.",5,895,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00895

The primary motivation is the sense of satisfaction derived from the contributions made at work, amongst others, of course, more realistically, economic and some sociological motivations. The survey results corroborated with the qualitative responses of seniors who participated in our focus group discussions.",6,896,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00896
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"We also conducted online surveys with the younger workers and employers to hear and examine the matter from their perspectives. In August this year, together with the support of Singapore Human Resources Institute (SHRI) and in partnership with Professor John Wong and the team from NUS and NUHS working on the Singapore Health District @ Queenstown, I joined a dialogue with human resource professionals and decision makers from different companies to understand their experience in hiring and managing seniors in the workforce.",7,897,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00897

2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The seniors, employers, HR professionals and younger employees we engaged, acknowledge the value of the many policies and programmes available today, that promote support and advance the hiring, training and retention of seniors in the workforce. However, all stakeholders agreed that more needs to be done to address challenges faced and to promote active employment of seniors for more meaningful and happier employment. It is not just the number of seniors being employed but the quality of the jobs and the work experience of seniors as well as seniors being able to fulfill the requirements of available jobs.",9,899,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00899
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Ageism and the continued need to learn new things or skills to stay relevant amid the dynamic macro environment were two key challenges and experiences shared by seniors in the survey and FGDs. Feedback from employers, younger workers and HR professionals highlighted the value of the experience, knowledge and expertise of older workers and the diversity with a multi-generational workforce. However again, all stakeholders, including seniors themselves, shared challenges of managing or working in a multi-generational workforce.",10,900,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00900

In our discussion with HR professionals, they did share that often business leaders may not consider workers above 50yrs for certain roles as they are seen as having not enough ""runway"". While citing these examples, seniors and HR professionals acknowledged that it is often unconscious bias and not a deliberate attempt to discriminate. From both the surveys and FGDs, seniors shared that they worry about not being able to continue to work after the retirement and re-employment age.",11,901,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00901
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In Singapore, the Retirement and Re-Employment Act (RRA) protects employees from being dismissed because of age. When they reach the retirement age, which is currently 63, the company will have to re-employ them until they reach the re-employment age, which is currently 68. In the FGD with HR professionals, they highlighted that while the intent is to protect older workers, the RRA is a double-edge sword, leading to an unconscious bias against selecting seniors for roles. As a company considers hiring someone who is senior and has little ""runway"" to retirement, they may see it as a risk to hire a person if he/she turns out not be a good fit for the role, as the company will be required to offer re-employment for the person when he/she reaches retirement age.",12,902,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00902

2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"From the employer FGD and the online survey with younger workers, a significant proportion of participants highlighted the need for seniors to learn new skills, especially digital skills. Employers also indicated that seniors may not have the motivation or interest to attend training due to lack of relevance of the training content, or not understanding the language used to deliver training, not being able to follow the pace of training, or not having the time. And this finding corresponds to the responses by seniors. The employers also indicated that there is a shortage of manpower to send employees away for training.",14,904,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00904
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"From the survey with younger workers, the findings showed a paradox, where a high proportion of respondents, which is 94%, which caught me by surprise as well, acknowledged the advantages of working with older colleagues and yet, a relatively high number of respondents, 78%, faced challenges working with older colleagues. I will not give you details of some of the responses they gave. These responses translate to the general sentiment that it is beneficial to work alongside older colleagues, but at the same time, one needs to recognise there are challenges in a multi-generational workforce. These challenges are attributed to the differences between people in terms of beliefs, mindset, values, disposition and working styles.",15,905,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00905

2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"We are facing structural economic and social shifts. We have an ageing population, longevity, healthier life expectancy, declining birth rates, technological advances and disruptions. The traditional one-directional and linear progression of distinct life stages of education, work and retirement and how they affect meaningful employment need to be seen through new lenses. Minister Ong Ye Kung touched on this point about life stages determining the different points in terms of health and I think we need to also look at it in terms of work.",18,908,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00908

2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"As people live longer and healthier, we continue to learn, we can be productive and we have a desire to contribute in different ways. This implies that many of us will continue to work as we age. This means that we will progress through our life stages in a non-linear way, where there are different pathways. Just as we allow for different pathways of our young in formal education, perhaps we need to re-think of how we structure this for seniors in the workforce to enable continuous learning and work. Individuals and employers know the value of continuous learning, the challenge is making time, making time to substantially invest in it. Hence, the vicious cycle of talent gaps and skills relevancy affecting both businesses and individuals. Structural intervention is required. For example, to allow a period of perhaps, maybe a few months for work related learning every few years. Then we will really build skills. Today, there is already significant subsidies and funds available for training and development. What is required is to make learning as systemic for workers and not just seniors in the workplace as it is for young in formal education.",20,910,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00910
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Making it systemic does not mean that it is a one size fits all. Individuals will want to make different choices, choices that will work for them. There should be multiple routes connecting the roles, opportunities and commitments of individuals throughout their adult lives. This will mean that people may transition in and out of life stages, work and learning often. We need to understand and support individuals to learn, work and age well throughout their lives. People need to be able to access learning formal and informal and acquire knowledge in ways that fit their life stages and their abilities.",21,911,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00911
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"An area emphasised by HR professionals in our FGD is the need for functional, technical and cognitive skills to support senior learners prepare and deal with career transitions.

Delivery methods should address the various needs and challenges for positive learning experience and outcomes.",22,912,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00912

Employers, younger workers and HR professionals we engaged, value the experience of the knowledge, experience and expertise of older workers as well as the diversity of a multi-generational workforce. Opportunities for mentoring and reverse mentoring were also highlighted. But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges were also highlighted.",24,914,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00914
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"With longevity, an ageing population, technological disruptions and flexible work arrangements, people are working longer. It is not just a matter of young versus old employees but multi-generational, four or five generations. Many organisations – I do not think we realise this – in many organisations today, there are multi-generations already there. Therefore, the needs of employees do differ between the different generations  the baby boomers, the Gen X, the Millennials, the Gen Z and now, the Generation Alphas. Factors such as one's tenure with the organisation, job type, job level add further complexity to this. Each generation has its preferences, working styles, its strengths, influenced by the world we grew up in, our work experiences and our life stage. Generational differences can lead to communication and difficulty of working together between different age groups in an organisation. Organisations must give attention to acknowledge and understand the challenges and put the right programmes, tools and processes to support and respect the needs of employees of all ages.",25,915,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00915
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"A World Economic Forum, AARP and the OECD study found that investing in a multi-generational workforce actually increases GDP per capita by almost 19% in three decades. The key learnings that were released by OECD revealed that the multi-generational workforces increased productivity, leads to better retention of experiences and know-how, increases resilience and better access to multi-skilled teams and other benefits. Age diversity in the workplace means varied experiences and points of view, which can become a source of innovation, if we are able to harness the strengths and varied experiences of all workers. This will not only foster a culture of creative thinking, innovation, better decision making and progress for all but also address the ageism and unconscious biases.",26,916,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00916
2022-10-05-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),A multi-generational workforce can also provide a platform for sharing of knowledge through mentoring and reverse mentoring amongst the different generations. We must do more in Singapore to understand and provide the environment to harness the strength of a multi-generational workforce. I do hope that MOM will agree with me on the benefits of a multi-generational workforce and will help put in place the right reforms in our system to make meaningful policies that will support this environment.,27,917,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00917

This change is not trivial. It will require all stakeholders to come together and take action to make the change if we are to tap the value of work of seniors and a multi-generational workforce in Singapore.

There is no one-size-fits-all-solution. Different businesses will have different needs and so do different senior workers.,20,941,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00941
2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),"A ground-up approach is thus needed where employers take ownership and conduct regular and structured career conversations with their senior workers. This is one of the key aspects that the NTUC's Company Training Committees (CTCs) seek to do – bringing together the employers, HR and employee representatives to identify gaps and opportunities and align the training plans for its workforce to its business transformation roadmap.",21,942,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00942
2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),MOM has also worked with the Singapore National Employers Federation to develop a structured career planning resource guide. I encourage more employers to utilise this guide and take a more deliberate approach in workforce planning.,22,943,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00943
2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),"As our population ages, multi-generational workplaces will increasingly be the norm. As Ms Jessica Tan has pointed out, a multi-generational workforce allows us to harness the experience and expertise of senior workers which can contribute to better productivity.",23,944,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00944
2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),"As the saying goes, ""姜还是老的辣"". The older, the wiser.

2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),We all have a role to play in creating effective multi-generational workplaces. Senior workers themselves play an important role in shaping perceptions. It may not be easy but they should be open to job role changes and picking up new skills to keep pace with technological advancements and also changes in the ways of working. The Government will always support our senior workers on this journey.,25,946,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00946
2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),"Employers should adopt age-friendly workplace practices such as job redesign to make tasks and workplace environments more age-friendly, providing flexible work arrangements and practising fair employment practices. Business leaders and HR have an important role to play in shaping a company culture that is age-friendly. The tripartite partners have taken steps to nurture age-friendly work practices.",26,947,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00947

I encourage employers to approach TAFEP to find out more. I would also like to encourage more employers to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Age-friendly Workplace Practices, which specifies a set of good age management practices and recognises progressive employers that implement them.",27,948,2022-10-05-T-021-S-00948
2022-10-05-T-021,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Manpower (Ms Gan Siow Huang),Several Members in this House today and in the past have expressed concerns with ageism affecting job opportunities and career progression for senior workers.

The Government will continue to provide the fullest support to enable our seniors to have longer careers and contribute meaningfully in multi-generational workplaces. But we cannot do this alone. We need a strong ecosystem of employers, unions, training institutions and, most of all, employees, young and old, to play a part to enable Singaporeans to harness the benefits of longevity.

2022-10-05-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Health what is the current breakdown by (i) registered and (ii) enrolled nurses for the nurse-to-patient ratios in general wards and intensive care units respectively.,1,955,2022-10-05-T-022-S-00955
2022-10-05-T-022,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As shared with the Member previously, the typical nurse-to-bed ratio for general wards in the public acute hospitals is one nurse for every four or five beds. In the Intensive Care Units (ICU), the ratio is typically one nurse for each ICU patient and may be higher, such as two nurses for more complex ICU cases.",1,956,2022-10-05-T-022-S-00956
2022-10-05-T-022,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The average skills mix proportion of nurses for these ratios is around 80% registered nurses and 20% enrolled nurses – the exact distribution will depend on the hospital’s clinical and operational needs, patient acuity and type of specialty settings.",2,957,2022-10-05-T-022-S-00957
2022-10-05-T-023,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether in planning of responses to monkeys in the urban environment, NParks has considered the proximity of monkey invasions to residents' homes, nursing homes and places of care for the elderly, preschool and childcare facilities; and (b) what measures are available to assist residents, especially children, who may be attacked or injured by monkeys.",1,958,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00958
2022-10-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We adopt a community- and science-based approach to managing the monkey population in Singapore. As part of these efforts, NParks closely monitors the geographical distribution of monkey-related feedback, taking into consideration their proximity to places such as residential homes, nursing homes and childcare facilities.",1,959,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00959
2022-10-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks also conducts research to better understand the population trends and distribution of monkeys and uses the findings from these studies to inform its measures to manage the monkey population. For example, at monkey hotspots, NParks carries out habitat modification by replacing or harvesting fruit trees. This reduces the availability of food for monkeys. In addition, NParks works closely with other public agencies, grassroots organisations and Town Councils to engage the community on proper refuse management and to deter illegal wildlife feeding. Through such efforts, we work with residents to mitigate the presence of wildlife in their estates.",2,960,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00960
2022-10-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks also partners the Long-tailed Macaque Working Group, which includes stakeholders such as academic experts and members of the nature community, to jointly develop and implement measures for monkey management. This includes monkey guarding, which NParks carries out in partnership with residents and other volunteers, to deter troops of monkeys from approaching residential areas.",3,961,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00961
2022-10-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In areas where individual monkeys display more intrusive or aggressive behaviour, NParks intervenes more strongly to protect public safety. This includes trapping and translocating such monkeys away from residential areas. In the longer term, NParks is also looking at population control measures such as sterilisation. Should NParks receive feedback on a monkey-related attack or injury, we will also assist the affected individual where we can.",4,962,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00962
2022-10-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks will continue to partner key stakeholders on its public engagement and outreach programmes. These include talks at preschools and childcare facilities near hotspots, engagement sessions in neighbourhoods and public webinars. Through these science-based programmes, residents can learn how to recognise the different facial expressions of monkeys, better understand their behaviour and respond to them safely.",5,963,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00963
2022-10-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"All of us have a part to play in minimising wildlife intrusions and keeping our community safe. We can do this by refraining from feeding wildlife, keeping our residential areas clean and appreciating wildlife from a safe distance.",6,964,2022-10-05-T-023-S-00964
2022-10-05-T-024,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Health in view of the recent case of a patient undergoing liver transplant shortly after cancer surgery (a) whether there are codes of practice for healthcare institutions presenting novel therapies; and (b) how long does a patient have to proceed with treatment after a novel therapy before being pronounced cancer-free.,1,965,2022-10-05-T-024-S-00965
2022-10-05-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Public healthcare institutions abide by MOH regulatory and services planning frameworks for the provision of clinical services. Medical practitioners are also bound by the Singapore Medical Council Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines which stipulated that patients should be treated according to generally accepted methods, based on a balance of available evidence and accepted best practices.",1,966,2022-10-05-T-024-S-00966
2022-10-05-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, any proposed novel innovative therapies will have to be assessed, balancing the available evidence for safety, efficacy and ethics, against accepted best practices. There must be professional consensus on the use of such novel therapies for the particular clinical situation should be sought from independent external experts and Clinical Ethics Committee, where appropriate.",2,967,2022-10-05-T-024-S-00967
2022-10-05-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Untested treatments that are not accepted as standard of care should only be offered under the strict context of research or clinical trial. These are subjected to MOH and HSA regulations and approval by institution’s ethics review committee and with informed consent from patients.,3,968,2022-10-05-T-024-S-00968
2022-10-05-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The term “remission” and “no evidence of disease” are commonly used to describe a clinical state where no evidence of cancer is currently detected in the body. Regardless of treatment type, patients will need to continue regular follow-up to screen for possible relapse, the frequency of which is based on clinical assessment and guidelines for specific cancers.",4,969,2022-10-05-T-024-S-00969
2022-10-05-T-025,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,"asked the Minister for Transport in view of the higher proportion of seniors involved in road traffic accidents (a) whether the Ministry can explain LTA’s planning norms for safe road crossing; (b) what are the criteria used to determine whether an overhead bridge with lifts or an underpass will be built despite their higher costs; and (c) whether LTA has or will adopt a design approach of co-creating with senior residents on where natural crossings need to be set up, especially in estates with more senior residents.",1,970,2022-10-05-T-025-S-00970
2022-10-05-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The safety of pedestrians is key when the Land Transport Authority (LTA) plans town infrastructure with the relevant agencies. Local roads with high pedestrian footfall are provided with signalised pedestrian crossings or zebra crossings as a default. In determining the locations of these crossings, LTA ensures that they are not so far apart as to inconvenience pedestrians and not so close that motorists do not have time to slow down and react.",1,971,2022-10-05-T-025-S-00971
2022-10-05-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For roads that are wider and have higher speed limits, grade-separated pedestrian crossings such as pedestrian overhead bridges or underpasses are provided. In particular, to provide barrier free crossings, LTA has retrofitted 77 pedestrian overhead bridges with lifts near places such as healthcare institutions which tend to serve seniors, with another 30 to be retrofitted with lifts over the next three years. Moving forward, all new pedestrian overhead bridges constructed by LTA will be barrier free.",2,972,2022-10-05-T-025-S-00972
2022-10-05-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Furthermore, LTA has implemented various initiatives for seniors in areas with high senior population or located near places frequented by them. For instance, to provide seniors with additional time to cross the road, LTA has implemented 1,008 Green Man + pedestrian crossings. LTA has also worked with the community including the seniors, to implement Silver Zones. So far, LTA has installed 26 Silver Zones and will be installing 24 more Silver Zones by 2025.",3,973,2022-10-05-T-025-S-00973
2022-10-05-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"These Silver Zones are specially designed to enhance road safety for seniors, with reduced speed limits, narrower and meandering lanes, more prominent road markings, raised crossings and speed humps. Together, these measures make roads safer for crossing in those areas and have effectively reduced the accident rate among senior pedestrians by about 80%.",4,974,2022-10-05-T-025-S-00974
2022-10-05-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Beyond Silver Zones, where there is local community support, LTA is also repurposing roads, to allow for wider footpaths and free up more space for better accessibility by pedestrians. One recent example of this is the widening of footpaths along Havelock Road and the building of a ramp for easier barrier-free access.",5,975,2022-10-05-T-025-S-00975
2022-10-05-T-026,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Health whether the annual MediSave withdrawal limits for chronic disease management will be completely lifted under Healthier SG.,1,976,2022-10-05-T-026-S-00976
2022-10-05-T-026,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The withdrawal limit for MediSave continues to be relevant and will be in place, to ensure adequacy in healthcare savings through life. In 2021, about nine in 10 of all patients who withdrew MediSave under the Chronic Disease Management Programme did not reach their annual limits. The Ministry will continue to monitor MediSave utilisation and review withdrawal limits regularly.",1,977,2022-10-05-T-026-S-00977
2022-10-05-T-027,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Law having regard to the current adoption rate of electronic fund transfers and cases involving payments to erroneous accounts, whether the Ministry will consider amending the Small Claims Tribunal Act 1984 to provide cost-effective and quick civil measures to recover misdirected funds.",1,978,2022-10-05-T-027-S-00978
2022-10-05-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If a person has made an electronic fund transfer in error, he should inform the unintended recipient or his bank of the mistake and request for the funds to be returned. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued guidelines on this issue. Under these guidelines, the sender’s bank should help to engage the recipient’s bank to inform the unintended recipient, so that a refund can be initiated. This framework helps parties resolve erroneous payments without the need to commence legal proceedings. If the recipient refuses to return funds that have been transferred in error, the sender should make a police report. It is an offence under the Penal Code for the recipient to retain or use the funds when he has been informed that it was transferred in error.",1,979,2022-10-05-T-027-S-00979
2022-10-05-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is also possible for the sender to bring a civil claim against the unintended recipient.

The year-on-year increase, from August 2021 before the energy crunch started to August 2022, is 20% and 50% for PNG and LNG provided under long term contracts respectively, and 224% for spot LNG. As Singapore imports most of our energy supply for electricity production, the increase in global energy prices over the past year will flow through into our prices.",2,1004,2022-10-05-T-034-S-01004
2022-10-05-T-034,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Countries around the world are struggling with rising energy prices, especially as winter approaches. I know that many Singaporeans are also concerned about whether something similar might happen to us. Our approach has always been to right-price electricity and provide targeted assistance, such as GST Voucher - U-Save rebates to consumers, especially to the vulnerable and low-income ones. The Energy Market Authority is also prepared to introduce more emergency measures to forestall extreme volatility in electricity prices if necessary.",3,1005,2022-10-05-T-034-S-01005

2022-10-05-T-035,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Due to the impact of COVID-19 on air travel, we had paused the T5 development for two years. We have since assessed that the long-term prospects for air travel remain strong, especially in the Asia Pacific region, underpinned by rapid economic growth and a fast-growing middle class in Southeast Asia and South Asia. We have resumed work on T5, which is expected to be operational around the mid-2030s.",2,1008,2022-10-05-T-035-S-01008

2022-10-05-T-036,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Singaporeans can continue to choose to seek care at any location, even after they have enrolled with a clinic under Healthier SG.

This is due to differences in costs and operating considerations between polyclinics and GP clinics.",2,1015,2022-10-05-T-037-S-01015
2022-10-05-T-037,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member’s last question is somewhat puzzling. We are giving additional subsidies to remove the differences in patients’ costs between polyclinics and GPs. The reason for any polyclinic fee adjustments has been to reflect changes in underlying costs, such as the salary costs of our healthcare workers.",3,1016,2022-10-05-T-037-S-01016

2022-10-05-T-053,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To provide opportunities for intergenerational bonding and greater convenience for our residents to meet the care needs of both the young and old, HDB co-locates the childcare and eldercare facilities where possible, such as in the multi-storey carparks or standalone community facilities buildings of new Build-To-Order (BTO) developments.",2,1075,2022-10-05-T-053-S-01075
2022-10-05-T-053,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Together with the various agencies, HDB and URA also explore co-locating various SCFs and other facilities within a single complex. One such example is Kampung Admiralty, which integrates housing for the elderly with an Active Ageing Hub and childcare centre, as well as other healthcare, commercial and community facilities. We will continue to explore such co-location opportunities, taking into consideration the local context and needs, availability of a suitable location, and the timelines and funding availabilities of the various co-locating agencies.",3,1076,2022-10-05-T-053-S-01076
2022-10-05-T-053,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Going forward, as part of HDB's recently launched ""Designing For Life"" roadmap, more childcare and eldercare facilities will also be located close to precinct facilities like three-generation playgrounds to facilitate inter-generational bonding and interaction.",4,1077,2022-10-05-T-053-S-01077
2022-10-05-T-054,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many shops in HDB housing estates have opted for the enhanced Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) scheme to upgrade the common property fronting their shops; and (b) what steps can be taken to boost the number of shops participating in the enhanced ROS scheme.",1,1078,2022-10-05-T-054-S-01078
2022-10-05-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The last batch of Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) sites announced in 2016 comprised 13 town and neighbourhood centres that applied for co-funding for upgrading of common areas, of which five eventually proceeded with upgrading. The upgrading works for these five sites, comprising around 270 shops, were progressively completed between 2019 and 2021.",1,1079,2022-10-05-T-054-S-01079
2022-10-05-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Since then, we have not announced any new ROS batch as HDB is reviewing the scheme. As part of this review, we conducted Focus Group Discussions with key stakeholders like Merchants' Associations and shop owners over 2021 to 2022 to gather feedback on how the ROS scheme can be improved. The feedback from these sessions has been useful in shaping some of the enhancements that we are considering for the scheme, which could translate to higher participation from shops.",2,1080,2022-10-05-T-054-S-01080
2022-10-05-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For instance, some participants had shared that the current ROS requirement to obtain 100% support from benefiting shop owners means that upgrading works cannot proceed if a small number of shop owners oppose the upgrading, even if the majority are in support.",3,1081,2022-10-05-T-054-S-01081
2022-10-05-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,We are currently firming up the details of the ROS enhancements and will be sharing more details in the coming months.,4,1082,2022-10-05-T-054-S-01082
2022-10-05-T-055,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for National Development what steps are being considered to assist shops and retail outlets in HDB housing estates to boost their vibrancy and competitiveness and address the general drop in patronage at these locations.,1,1083,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01083
2022-10-05-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB shops not only provide residents with convenient access to essential goods and services, but also serve as a social node for residents to mingle and enhance the vibrancy of HDB communities. HDB shops are well-patronised by our residents  and overall vacancy rate for HDB shops remains low. Nevertheless, our heartland shops do face challenges given changing consumer habits and preferences, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,1084,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01084
2022-10-05-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Given the important role the heartland shops play in our HDB estates, the Government has put in place various short- and medium-term measures to tide them through difficult periods and to help them transform for the future.",2,1085,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01085
2022-10-05-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the past one to two years, the Heartland Digitalisation and Revitalisation Committee (HDRC), co-chaired by Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Minister of State Low Yen Ling, supported heartland merchants in advancing their digitalisation efforts and growing their revenue streams. The HDRC worked with agencies to introduce initiatives such as Heartlands Go Digital to accelerate the adoption of digital solutions and Visual Merchandising to improve heartland shopfront aesthetics to attract customers. Events were also organised to attract footfall. For example, the three-month long Heartlands Festival, which commenced in November 2021, resulted in 20% more footfall in participating precincts and up to 30% more revenue among some shops. Support packages such as rental waivers for our HDB merchants and Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers were also given out to Singaporean households to use at participating hawkers and heartland merchants.",3,1086,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01086
2022-10-05-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Beyond the business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there is a need to undertake deeper measures to help our shops remain competitive and relevant to customers and the community. Firstly, under the Revitalisation of Shops scheme (ROS), HDB provides co-funding to help retailers upgrade their shopping environment or carry out promotional events to attract crowds. HDB is currently reviewing how it can further improve this scheme, to enhance its attractiveness and increase the take up rates. More details will be announced in the coming months.",4,1087,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01087
2022-10-05-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Secondly, as announced during Committee of Supply 2022, HDB partnered Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) to launch Our Heartlands 2025 programme. Over the next four years, up to $50 million will be set aside to support heartland shops, (i) continuing to deepen digitalisation and manpower capabilities; (ii) enhancing liveliness of shopfronts and supporting events to draw footfall; and (iii) upgrading capabilities of Trades Associations and Chambers to better support heartland shops.",5,1088,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01088
2022-10-05-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Finally, HDB has also partnered with EnterpriseSG and the Prime Minister's Office to undertake the Heartlands Shops Study, which is a study on the social and economic value of heartland shops for various stakeholders such as residents, business owners and merchant associations. Over 2,800 stakeholders were engaged through the study to gather feedback and ideas on how to increase vibrancy, inclusiveness and heritage in our heartland shops. We will reference the views and study new measures to further enhance the vibrancy and relevance of heartland shops.",6,1089,2022-10-05-T-055-S-01089

Heartland merchants or hawkers who are interested to be enrolled onto the Scheme, can register with the CDCs at the website  vouchers.cdc.gov.sg or through their respective Merchants' Associations, Hawkers' Associations, or Business Advisers at SME Centres@CDC. The CDC Ambassadors will then visit the merchants and hawkers in the heartlands to make an assessment and enrol them.",1,1091,2022-10-05-T-056-S-01091

2022-10-05-T-057,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,MOM investigates offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) such as employment kickbacks and takes appropriate enforcement action against errant parties. Enhancements to the EFMA in 2012 (for instance the establishment of employment kickbacks as a standalone contravention) allow MOM to more effectively enforce against such offences.,1,1094,2022-10-05-T-057-S-01094
2022-10-05-T-057,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"There are existing processes for MOM to work with other agencies or to obtain necessary information if required during investigation into employment kickbacks offences.
