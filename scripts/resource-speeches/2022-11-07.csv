2022-11-07-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) for the past six months, how many patients or residents contracted COVID-19 infections from within residential healthcare facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes; and (b) whether the Ministry is satisfied with the effectiveness of the current COVID-19 measures implemented at these facilities.",1,1,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00001
2022-11-07-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"From 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2022, there were around 330 reported cases from COVID-19 clusters in hospitals. Over the same period, around 3,000 COVID-19 cases were reported by the nursing homes. These constitute a small proportion – less than 1% – of total reported community cases. As we move towards living with COVID-19, we no longer adopt a zero-COVID posture in hospitals and nursing homes, where all patients or nursing home residents need to be tested before admission and where infected patients are isolated in hospital COVID wards.",1,2,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00002
2022-11-07-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"Notwithstanding, we continue to take necessary precautions to protect patients and residents, and are ready to step up the COVID-19 measures, such as visitor restrictions, when necessary. Vaccination is our primary defence. It cannot completely stop infections but is very effective in preventing severe illness from COVID-19. We have provided COVID-19 vaccinations to over 90% of eligible nursing home residents. With these measures, we have kept Singapore’s overall case fatality rate at about 0.1%, well below the global average of around 1%.",2,3,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00003

2022-11-07-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I have three supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. Earlier, he cited some figures about patients and residents who had contracted COVID-19 from within these facilities. I think he mentioned 330 in hospitals and about 3,000 in nursing homes over that period of time. May I ask him how confident is he that these are not under-estimates of the actual situation because some patients could be asymptomatic and I am not sure whether there is 100% testing daily?",1,5,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00005
2022-11-07-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is that, there are some studies in the UK which suggest that within healthcare facilities, patient-to-patient transmission was more a common cause of infections rather than, say, from healthcare workers to patients. I wonder whether the Ministry has been studying this issue and whether the Senior Minister of State can elaborate on whether it is the case that it is more likely to be patient-to-patient transmission rather than healthcare worker-to-patient, or whether the Ministry has some other grasp of the nature of the transmissions?",2,6,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00006
2022-11-07-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And finally, I understand from some other overseas studies as well in the UK that hospital-acquired infections may be affected by things like ventilation systems and design of wards. Is the Ministry looking into these methods as well?",3,7,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00007
2022-11-07-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the numbers may be an under-estimate. We did not do daily testing on everybody. I think the Member would agree this would be inappropriate to subject every person within this space  – whether a healthcare worker, a patient or a visitor – to daily testing",1,8,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00008
2022-11-07-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Having said that, we have quite a lot of data over the last three years. That data is applicable to the community setting, the hospitals as well as the nursing homes. This has allowed us and the scientists in our system to model the transmission and the clusters and the spread of COVID-19 within different settings. So, to answer the question, yes, it may be an under-estimate, but I think we are confident that we have a robust handle on the relative proportions. So, it is approximately correct – 330 versus 3,000. I do not think our under-estimate is so far off that the numbers would be reversed, for example, or that we are in the order of magnitude of a significant percentage off. We are about right and we have some confidence that we are about right.",2,9,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00009
2022-11-07-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Her second question was whether patient-to-patient transmission or healthcare worker-to-patient transmission, which was a greater contributory factor in our setting, in our system. I do not have the data in front of me. I would encourage the Member to file a separate question if she would like further information on that. But if I may make a related, tangential point, which is that the COVID-19 circumstances changed quite significantly over the three years. Simplistically, we had different variants with different transmissibility and infectivity characteristics, but we also had very significantly different measures in place at different time periods over the nearly three years. And so, I would think it would be too much, too reductionist, too simplistic to look at the overall picture. This would require quite a detailed study to be able to come to a conclusive position as to which was a greater risk at any one point in time. I think it is a little bit too simplistic to say it is one or the other. But I would be happy to take this up if the Member would like to file a question and we will try our best to provide her what data we may or may not have.",3,10,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00010
2022-11-07-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Her third question was whether the design of the wards, the ventilation, can affect hospital-acquired infections. Indeed, there are things that have been studied prior to COVID-19. There are people looking at this and looking at this not with respect to just one infection but a wide variety of infective agents which may affect our patients within the hospitals. So, the short answer is yes.",4,11,2022-11-07-T-001-S-00011
2022-11-07-T-002,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider expanding the intake of our three local medical schools; (b) what are the measures to reduce the attrition rate of doctors in the public sector; and (c) which are the top five countries that our foreign doctors are recruited from.,1,12,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00012
2022-11-07-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, over the last 10 years – from 2010 to 2019 – our medical schools have increased their combined annual intakes by around 60% from around 320 to 510. In 2020 and 2021, we admitted another 40 medical students each year. These were students whose overseas medical studies were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,13,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00013
2022-11-07-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"While our main source of doctors will continue to be our local medical schools, about 200 locals who study or practise medicine overseas return to Singapore annually. Most of them study or work in Australia, the United Kingdom or Ireland. In addition, we supplement recruitment with qualified doctors from recognised universities from other countries, to ease the workload in specific departments and hospitals. Currently, the top five countries that our foreign doctors are recruited from are India, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.",2,14,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00014
2022-11-07-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),The attrition rate of doctors from the public healthcare sector into private practice is acceptable and it ranges from 3% to 5% in the time period 2019 to 2021. We continue to make various efforts to retain our doctors within the public healthcare sector.,3,15,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00015

2022-11-07-T-002,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Can MOE work with MOH to increase the intake of deserving local Polytechnic graduates? The second supplementary question  I understand that returning Singaporeans from recognised foreign universities have a difficult path of obtaining their full registration licences. Can MOH put in measures to ease the transition?",1,17,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00017
2022-11-07-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his two questions. There is a point that is related across both of the questions, which is that we have to have a series of processes that maintains standards for our medical professionals. So, on his first question, it is around the academic standards; the second is around safety and the regulatory practices around the person being fully registered.",1,18,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00018
2022-11-07-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In both cases, we have a framework looking at the standards required to enter medical school and then, to enter full practice. On the first point of whether those standards for medical students should be altered in some way, I think he would agree with me that it should not. We do have to make sure that the people who go into the medical schools have the aptitude, the attitude, the ability to not just complete their studies but have the ability to do well. Having said that, there are Polytechnic graduates who are making it into medical school – we see them reported in the press. I think the importance is that they have met those standards and then, are able to flourish within medical schools; and they have a fulfilling career. We will continue to study this space.",2,19,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00019
2022-11-07-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The same principle applies then to his second question, which is about foreign-trained doctors coming to practise within Singapore. In order to serve the mission to the public, we should hold them to the same safety requirements as any other graduate from a local university going out into medical practice. And so, there is a standard set of approaches in order to make sure that they are safe to practise before they get fully registered. And I am sure the Member would agree – we should not reduce those standards.",3,20,2022-11-07-T-002-S-00020
2022-11-07-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether Singaporeans are paying (i) the cost of state land used for public housing when initially acquired by the Government (ii) the difference between the higher land cost when the land was purchased by HDB for development, and that which the Government initially acquired the land for and (iii) taxes to cover the shortfall incurred by HDB from the land cost paid to past reserves at full market price, thereby amounting to triple payments for use of state land that are developed into HDB flats if the land acquisition and development occurred in two different terms of Government.",1,21,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00021

2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Under our land laws, which trace back to English land laws, all title to land in Singapore is derived from the state. It is from this ultimate title to land that is held by the state that interest in land, such as leases, can be carved out and granted by the state to other persons. The leases confer ownership and possession of those lands to such other persons, but only for the duration of the lease. The state retains the interest in the balance of the lands not leased, and for lands which have been leased, in the rest of the period not granted.",2,28,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00028

It then becomes state land again and will be protected as past reserves once again. When that happens, there is no net increase in our reserves either. This is because the reversionary interest in that parcel of land had all along formed part of our reserves. In other words, the financial proceeds that we had earlier received was to make up for the state's loss of use of the land for 99 years, and not for the state giving the land away forever.",1,40,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00040

2022-11-07-T-003,,,(a) There is no net increase in the reserves when state land is first sold and the sales proceeds are transferred to the financial assets. It is just a conversion of one asset form to another.,4,43,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00043

2022-11-07-T-003,,,(d) There is an increase in reserves when the Government invests and grows the financial assets. This is the outcome of careful and prudent management of our reserves by this Government and should not be taken for granted.,7,46,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00046
2022-11-07-T-003,,,"I move on to Mr Leong's second query. There is no ""triple payment"" by Singaporeans for the land used to develop HDB flats. From time to time, the Government may need to compulsorily acquire land for public housing. In that event, the following steps occur.",8,47,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00047
2022-11-07-T-003,,,"First, the Government will acquire the land and compensate the landowner for its value. Since 2007, the compensation is based on fair market value.

2022-11-07-T-003,,,"Second, HDB will purchase the land from Government. HDB pays fair market value for it, just like any other buyer of state land. Why do we do this? Why do we not simply transfer the land to HDB at zero cost since it is a transaction between Government and a Government agency?",10,49,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00049
2022-11-07-T-003,,,"The reason is because, the transfer to HDB for developing public housing results in the land being taken out of the past reserves. If fair market value is not paid in exchange for the land, the past reserves would be depleted. There would be no corresponding financial asset to replace the physical asset and no land sale proceeds to invest and generate returns for use in the form of the NIRC. Requiring HDB to pay fair market value for the land cost thus preserves the value of our past reserves for the benefit of all Singaporeans, both present and future.",11,50,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00050

So, the subsidy is applied by HDB and that is why flats can be sold at an affordable price. So, that is the correlation.",1,66,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00066
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I am not sure I understand the correlation. I think everybody knows that HDB applies subsidies, significant subsidies. So, I think there are two things. If Mr Singh was just asking, ""Can you provide the breakdown?"" – that I understand. But he is saying in view of the POFMA Correction Directions, whether HDB will provide the breakdown.",1,67,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00067
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, I will answer Mr Singh's question on whether we will provide breakdown. I am just trying to understand how it is correlated. Because the fact that we provided subsidies has always been known, long before the POFMA Correction Directions. So, I just want to know the connection.",2,68,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00068
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The connection would be that the identity of the individual who was issued the POFMA Correction Direction – I cannot name him by virtue of Standing Orders, but he was the chief economist of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. So, if the Minister says that this has been known for a long time, one would expect someone of that stature to also not fall afoul of POFMA and be POFMA-ed.",1,69,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00069
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"But I think the Minister has said that she will answer that question – so, I hope the Minister can answer that question on whether HDB will provide a breakdown of the subsidies.",2,70,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00070
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Again, I will answer the question, but I want to deal with the first part. If Mr Singh says how come somebody who was an ex-economist of — did you name the organisation?",1,71,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00071
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,I did.,1,72,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00072
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Okay, of GIC, can be POFMA-ed. I do not think there is any rule in the law books, which says that economists and ex-economists of GIC cannot be POFMA-ed. What the law says is that if you say something which is factually incorrect, then you are required to post a Notice, pointing out to it. And you can challenge that if you wish to – which he has not.",1,73,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00073
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Point number two is, Mr Singh still has not really answered what the correlation is, but now I will just cut to the chase, unless Mr Singh wishes to provide a further clarification.",2,74,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00074
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The chase is this  the POFMA-ed post alleged that there was a ""disingenuous and misleading analysis"" of the $270 million loss made by HDB. That is what the POFMA-ed post said. It also said that it was ""an accounting sleight of hand being the omission that the government acquired most of the land at minimal or much lower cost by compulsory acquisition"" and that the ""true cost price should be the original book value"". Those were the key things.",3,75,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00075
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And in response, the POFMA Clarification pointed out that actually there is a real loss. The fact that when we build HDB flats under the housing programme, the fact that the Government incurs losses, that is known and was always known, even before Mr Yeoh posted it.",4,76,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00076
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But coming back to the question that the Leader of the Opposition has asked, the reason why I say there is no correlation is this  it is because what Minister Desmond Lee gave in the POFMA Clarification was the net loss. Let me just explain.",5,77,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00077
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Total development cost is land costs plus construction costs and that gives you total development cost. Then, you have the selling price. The selling price is the market value of the land after it has been built, we apply a market subsidy, we derive the selling price, we put in various grants and we arrive at the effective selling price. [Please refer to “Clarification by the Minister, Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development”, Official Report, 7 November 2022, Vol 73, Issue No 95, Clarification section.]",6,78,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00078
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The effective selling price – what we sell to Singaporeans – less the total development cost, will give you, in virtually all cases, a net loss – obviously, because we are subsidising and selling below market value. If we were to sell at market value, all purchasers of HDB BTOs will be paying a lot more. And that is just evident, as I had explained in my earlier answer, from the resale prices after the MOP expires when they sell.",7,79,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00079
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, I just wanted to establish that the POFMA Clarification talked about the net loss for a particular project. That is a subset of the information which is already in HDB's financial statements, which is the total aggregate net loss. And it is a separate issue from total development costs, which is a separate thing.",8,80,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00080
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, when Mr Pritam Singh asked in view of the POFMA Correction Directions, is HDB going to give the breakdown of total development costs, there is not a real correlation there, as they are two separate things.",9,81,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00081
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Should we give the total development costs? The answer is that we do not think that anything would be achieved by doing so. And the reason is this  what is the real important thing to Singaporeans? The real important thing is, are you able to afford the flat? And what the Government considers is the market value, which people will know. In any particular area, you ask any valuer, and they will be able to give you a general value.",10,82,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00082
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And you look at the selling price and the grants. Every Singaporean who buys a BTO knows that actually the price that they are paying is less than what you would have to pay if you were paying at pure market price. That is why BTOs are so popular. Otherwise, you would buy a resale flat.",11,83,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00083
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And then, what happens is, at the end of the day, for almost all cases, we have a net loss.",12,84,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00084
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, different places will have different prices and different subsidies. Mr Singh's question was, he said, would we provide a breakdown of the cost of all new flats henceforth. It is not meaningful, because you would just be comparing this one with this one and prices in one area may not be the same as the other.",13,85,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00085
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, that is the answer. My straightforward answer is that it would not be helpful or meaningful to do so.",14,86,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00086
2022-11-07-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.,1,87,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00087
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I thank the Minister for answering the question. Let me suggest why, it perhaps could be meaningful. And I will do this by way of two supplementary questions. This is specific to Question No 5. I will come back to Question Nos 3 and 4 in a while.",1,88,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00088
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Since the introduction of the Prime Location Housing, or PLH, flats last year, it provides an example of why a detailed publication of HDB subsidies are actually warranted. An HDB PLH flat buyer, upon selling his PLH flat after the 10-year MOP, will have to return the quantum of additional subsidies provided as a percentage of the original assessed market value of the flat; and the subsidy recovery will apply to the resale price that is a reflection of the prevailing market value, regardless of whether the flat is sold at a gain or a loss.",2,89,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00089
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Another reason I would suggest to the Minister to publish the dollar value of the subsidy is to scrutinise and track the amount of subsidies being diverted for homeownership purposes. This is, particularly, in view of the MND's 2011 decision to delink BTO prices from the rising resale market then. The median price of a 4-room and larger HDB resale flats has increased 26% between 2017 and 2022, with resale prices reaching record highs today and, therefore, pushing up the market price of land. Increasing the size of the subsidies under the current HDB policy would appear to be the main way through which BTO prices will be kept affordable.",3,90,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00090
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"In view of these new reasons, what is preventing HDB from publishing the dollar value of HDB subsidies for new BTO flats?",4,91,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00091
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The second supplementary question  HDB's index for affordability – the Minister spoke about it in her last reply – only covers non-mature estates. HDB states that the price-to-income ratio for BTO flats offered in non-mature estates is around five or less, which means the purchase price is around five times one's annual income, or around 25% of one's salary is set aside for mortgage servicing. Why does the Ministry not disclose the corresponding affordability figures for HDB estates which are mature estates.",5,92,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00092
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In respect to Prime Location Housing, it actually does not really change my answer. Because at the end of the day, the question is – what is affordable to the person who is buying? And we have made no secret of the fact that, for Prime Location Housing, you would have to have a greater subsidy. That is the key thing.",1,93,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00093
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"It comes back to the same question, which is  why would you have to disclose or put out the development cost of every single project? It is just not meaningful. The key thing is, to the buyer, is this affordable and that is what HDB does.",2,94,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00094
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And, I think, for the second question, if Mr Singh could just pinpoint the gravamen of what he is asking, so that I can be sure I address it.",3,95,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00095

2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,The second supplementary question pertains to disclosing the affordability index for mature estates. That is the supplementary question. But the Minister did not answer the second limb of the first supplementary question.,1,98,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00098
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, the second limb, the Minister replied for PLH. I take Minister's answer, even though I disagree with it, of course.",2,99,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00099
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,The second question was with regard to the delinking of BTO prices as a reason to reveal the subsidy in full.,3,100,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00100
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I do have the question and I thank Mr Singh for it. Can I ask Mr Singh to file a separate Parliamentary Question on this? The reason is this.

2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I understand. So, just to be clear, the question the Minister is asking me to file another question for, is the reasons why HDB does not publish the affordability index for mature BTO estates? Okay, I will do so.",1,103,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00103
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"For the first question, I restate my position that because we have now delinked BTO prices, the value of the subsidy becomes more important, particularly, with resale prices going up.",2,104,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00104
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"On the earlier question, which I believe was directed at Mr Leong Mun Wai's Questions Nos 3 and 4, just for clarification and my understanding about how land is booked in the reserves, and I am looking at this from the perspective of reclaimed land  Singapore's total land area has grown by 2.45 square kilometres per year for 60 years – from 851 square kilometres in 1962 to 728 square kilometres in 2020. The state can reclaim land and draw on the reserves for land reclamation activities and expenses – I think Minister also alluded to that in her reply.",3,105,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00105
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"My two supplementary questions are as follows. I would like to ask the Minister, does the value of new land that has been reclaimed go into current reserves; and, in connection with this, is it based on the actual cost of reclamation or the value of new land based on the chief valuers' land betterment charge (LBC) tables? That is the first supplementary question.",4,106,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00106
2022-11-07-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The second one is, for land that has been reclaimed years prior, is the revaluation for marking to market done once a year based on the annual LBC rates, or once every six months based on the six-monthly LBC rates, or is the value of the land in past reserves held at the cost of land reclamation until it is sold to the Government for specific use?",5,107,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00107
2022-11-07-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Again, Sir, I would ask Mr Singh to file a Parliamentary Question formally. The answer is likely to be technical, it has to do with how we treat the land in our books and I really want to make sure that both the Accountant-General and the Auditor-General are satisfied that what I say is not inaccurate.",1,108,2022-11-07-T-003-S-00108
2022-11-07-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how are HDB rental housing eligibility criteria and rental rates affected by the increase in wages arising from the Progressive Wage Model; and (b) whether low-wage earners who may become ineligible for rental housing or who have to pay higher rents as a result of higher wages will be discouraged from renting HDB flats.,1,109,2022-11-07-T-004-S-00109

HDB adopts a holistic and needs-based approach when assessing requests for public rental flats, and the $1,500 income threshold is just a guideline and not a hard ceiling. Applicants will not be rejected based on income alone, as HDB will also consider applicants' circumstances, including their household size, family support, housing budget and options.",1,110,2022-11-07-T-004-S-00110

I wanted to reflect this ground feedback from employers and bosses of lower-income workers. They are telling me that when they increase the pay of the workers, for example, through compliance to PWM, some of the lower-wage workers were very worried, that, one, they will not be eligible for HDB rental flats because although it is mentioned that $1,500 is a guideline, I think, to many of them, from the official document, it does not sound like it is a guideline; it sounds like that was an income criterion for rental eligibility.

2022-11-07-T-006,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We note that Mr Gerald Giam is asking the Government to consider requiring HDB flat owners to sell their HDB flats, or dispose their HDB flats, if they buy private property. Mr Yip Hon Weng had also called for this last month. We have been gathering views from Singaporeans as part of Forward Singapore, particularly around the social compact on public housing, and will study these as well as other views and ideas carefully.",5,131,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00131

2022-11-07-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for his reply. Sir, resale flat prices have gone up about 28% in the last two years and this year alone, between January and September, more than 266 flats sold for over $1 million. So, this has put resale flats beyond the reach of many Singaporeans, even after factoring in the generous Government grants.",1,133,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00133
2022-11-07-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The purpose of my question was to discuss ways to moderate resale flat prices, so they are more affordable for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. And one way to achieve this is to increase the supply of resale flats. So, since HDB flats are meant for owner occupation, can HDB owners who buy private property in the future be required to sell their flats so that the flats are freed up to be bought by other Singaporeans?",2,134,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00134
2022-11-07-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),I note that the Minister has said that this is under discussion and I appreciate that. Because this will be consistent with the current rule which requires private property owners who buy an HDB flat to dispose their private property within six months of the flat purchase.,3,135,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00135
2022-11-07-T-006,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I have given the Member the proportion of HDB flat owners who concurrently hold private property as well as HDB flats. There are about 3%. And of those who rent out their HDB flats, it is a smaller subset of that. Having said that, I have given the Member a reply that we study all options and possibilities. Members know that we do not discuss cooling measures, other than those that have already been issued.",1,136,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00136
2022-11-07-T-006,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For resale flat prices, the Member is right. They have been going up in the last two years for the reasons I mentioned in the last Parliamentary Sitting. We have taken measures – both in December last year and September this year – to cool the property market by moderating demand and let the measures work their way through the market.",2,137,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00137
2022-11-07-T-006,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are also mindful of macroeconomic conditions going forward  rising interest rates, uncertainty in the economic climate globally, people being more prudent in their home purchases.

2022-11-07-T-006,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member repeats the point about million-dollar flats. Indeed, these headline-grabbing prices have caused concern and fuelled market psychology, causing people to worry, and then, hence, go into the market. That also adds to the impact we have seen on the resale market.",4,139,2022-11-07-T-006-S-00139
2022-11-07-T-006,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And million-dollar flats make up, in the last two years, about 1% of all resale transactions. They tend to have very good attributes.

2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have stepped up efforts to increase awareness and take up of Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) over the years. First, we waived the $75 application fee for filing an LPA. We have seen a significant increase in LPA registrations since its introduction. In 2013, around 2,200 Singaporeans registered an LPA. In 2021, over 32,000 did so. Nearly 95% of the 153,000 Singaporeans who have registered their LPAs, benefited from the fee waiver.",2,150,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00150
2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, we will be launching a new Office of Public Guardian Online, or OPGO, e-service on 14 November 2022, so that it is even easier to make an LPA. In designing the e-service, we paid extra attention to seniors and those less comfortable with technology. Hence, the application form will be an easy questionnaire that guides the user in creating his or her LPA. Instructions are in plain English and are also available in the other official languages. Additionally, users can view step-by-step instructional videos in the four official languages and Quick Reference Guides to help them navigate the e-service. We have tested the service with older users, who reported they were confident to use it.",3,151,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00151

Residents who prefer in-person assistance can approach ServiceSG Centres, Citizen Connect Centres and the Office of the Public Guardian. Officers there will be able to help them with the online LPA application. Staff at other community touchpoints – such as Senior Activity Centres, restructured hospitals and nursing homes – will also be able to provide advice to residents.",4,152,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00152
2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, we will be stepping up efforts to help Singaporeans appreciate the importance of pre-planning. The Office of the Public Guardian and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will run a publicity and outreach campaign from 2023 to 2025 to encourage Singaporeans, especially those aged 50 and above, to make their LPAs and Advance Care Plans.

2022-11-07-T-008,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Minister for the answer. I have two follow-up questions. One is, does the Ministry track the adoption of LPA, those who apply, by age group above 60, maybe in 10-year bands? Because I think the older they are the more this is important for them. I am very heartened to hear the high absolute number growth, but I am not sure what it is from the baseline. So, do we track the percentage of our population above 60 years old by 10-year bands on their adoption of LPA?",1,159,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00159
2022-11-07-T-008,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"The second question is, for those that may have more difficulties getting an LPA, will the Ministry consider an opt-out scheme where appropriate donees are given to them and if they opt out, then they cannot be a part of LPA?",2,160,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00160
2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For internal, specific purposes, we do track who are on, who have been enrolled, so that we can see by trend, at what age they enrol. I think it is noteworthy that while we want those who are above 50 as our target to be on LPA, I think all of us should be on LPA as soon as possible. And even for our children to be on LPA and not think that it is something we can postpone until usually too late.",1,161,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00161

2022-11-07-T-008,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Thank you, Speaker. I have two questions. The first is in relation to the fee waiver. I wish to clarify with the Minister whether there are plans to waive the fees, because currently, Singaporeans are eligible for the fee waiver until 31 March 2023. That has been the trend for the past few years of several rounds of extension of the waiver. I wish to understand whether the Ministry intends to consider extending the waiver indefinitely.",1,164,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00164
2022-11-07-T-008,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The second question is in relation to stepping up on the outreach. The Silver Generation Ambassadors have been a good touchpoint in interacting with our seniors. So, whether OPG intends to train our Silver Generation Ambassadors, so that as part of the outreach, one of the key topics that the Ambassadors can consider to do, is to broach this topic in relation to the importance of doing an LPA.",2,165,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00165
2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The fees that we impose are just to recover cost. We have extended the waiver to make the fee not become a barrier to taking up an LPA. But I do not think, though, that the fee is the only reason why people do not take up an LPA. There are cultural reasons. There is also the sense that we can postpone this as late as possible, and therefore, we do have to do more, particularly to raise awareness, the importance of having the LPA in place as soon as we can.",1,166,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00166
2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But, having said that, we will certainly study to extend the fee waiver, if necessary, and also to facilitate the take-up of LPA.",2,167,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00167
2022-11-07-T-008,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, I do agree with the Member that we will be training the SGAs and all our connect points where seniors are likely to come or to seek help, so that they can be assisted to understand what the LPA is, why it is important and what the cultural and also, sometimes, religious worries and concerns that need to be addressed, so that they can overcome them and then take up the LPA as soon as they can.",3,168,2022-11-07-T-008-S-00168
2022-11-07-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry will provide an update on the Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity (SP-CCA) programme; (b) whether this programme will be extended to more sports and arts activities; (c) whether the programme will be extended to primary schools; and (d) whether the Ministry will work together with National Sports Associations to deliver sports through the SP-CCA programme.,1,169,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00169

I think it is a very useful tool, especially, with some of the schools not having the resources as well as the number of athletes or participants to form a full team or the CCAs. I have two supplementary questions.",1,175,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00175
2022-11-07-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"First, what are the considerations for sports uniform group or visual and performing arts programmes to be included as an SP-CCA programme? Would the consideration for strategic national representation or high performance be made a consideration, including such sports or programmes? I think this comes from like team sports, for example, where you cannot really form a team; or take, for example, diving or gymnastics, where we have athletes going to the Olympic games, and not all schools provide these CCAs. I think the number of schools are reducing. So, how can they be considered?",2,176,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00176
2022-11-07-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"The second supplementary question is on the current SP-CCA programme. How is MOE engaging SportSG to ensure the delivery of these programmes are aligned to the curriculum prescribed by MOE, as these are co-curricular activities?",3,177,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00177
2022-11-07-T-009,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"On the first question, indeed, we would like to extend SP-CCA to more activities in sports and the arts. At the end of the day, we want to allow our students with different talent to be able to flourish and develop their talent. We also note that the students themselves need to indicate their preferences, need to be able to travel outside of their schools. We know that for some of our students, they want to do CCAs within their own schools so that they can be with their friends, so that they can play sports and do activities with people whom they know.",1,178,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00178
2022-11-07-T-009,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"So, the SP-CCA is actually an add-on, an additional channel for our students who have the passion to pursue sports and the arts that are not offered by their schools, or for various reasons, to be able to do so. So, the main consideration is our students' preferences and their passion. We cannot force the students to go for sports and arts, just because we think it is strategic and it is something that we want them to be good at. At the end of the day, we have to respect the students' choices.",2,179,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00179

2022-11-07-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"On the first supplementary question, it is more like, giving them an option. National Sports Associations (NSAs) can play a part in delivering these co-curricular activities through SP-CCA programmes. We are not forcing any students to choose. We are simply providing options for them. If they so choose to, then it is great. It will be good to have the opportunity to have these programmes at the Primary school level as well as the Secondary school level.",1,181,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00181
2022-11-07-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"The second question is, these are co-curricular activities. Presumably, there is a curriculum for CCAs to be delivered; there are some things or outcomes that will be delivered through the CCAs. How are these delivered through these SP-CCA programmes and how are these communicated to SportSG so that these outcomes are delivered through CCAs?",2,182,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00182
2022-11-07-T-009,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"MOE and SportSG have regular meetings, where we discuss the outcomes desired of the CCA programmes. That is where we get SportSG to design the CCAs to suit the learning needs and development outcomes that we want of our students. I thank the Member, Mr Mark Chay, for agreeing with us that what we are trying to do, really, is to provide more options and opportunities for our students to be able to pursue arts as well as sports.",1,183,2022-11-07-T-009-S-00183
2022-11-07-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of households that have successfully applied for the Lease Buyback Scheme since it was implemented; (b) whether there are plans to improve and expand the scheme; and (c) what are the common reasons why home owners are not considering the scheme.,1,184,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00184
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, since its introduction in March 2009, about 9,200 households have joined the Lease Buyback Scheme.

In return, they receive a stream of income in their retirement years, while continuing to live in their flat.",1,185,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00185
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"When the Lease Buyback Scheme was first introduced, only owners of 3-room or smaller flats were eligible. The Scheme has since been expanded to owners of all flat types, including 5-room and larger flats. In April 2020, the maximum LBS bonus was increased by 50% across all flat types, to $30,000 for 3-room and smaller flats, $15,000 for 4-room flats and $7,500 for 5-room and bigger flats.",2,186,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00186
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"There are various reasons why elderly flat owners may not be keen to take up the Lease Buyback Scheme.

2022-11-07-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In my view, the ageing-in-place offered by Lease Buyback Scheme is the most suitable for seniors, especially when there is no change in the environment; and unlike renting, they have to live with someone as well. So, I would like to ask the Minister, he mentioned about 9,200 households so far, since the implementation. How can we promote the scheme, so that seniors understand the scheme and the help it can provide, the financial security without having to move out to a new environment?",2,191,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00191
2022-11-07-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The second question is, most of the concerns I hear from residents, are that they are worried that they outlive the 30-year tenure of the buyback. And they may have no place to stay thereafter. So, can I ask the Minister if the Government can give a stronger assurance that this would not be the case?",3,192,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00192
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me deal with the second question first. When the Lease Buyback Scheme was introduced and subsequently enhanced, this question arose and it continues to operate on the minds of seniors, ""Will I outlive the remaining lease of my flat having sold the tail end."" That is number one. Our response is, we will not allow that to happen. We will work with the senior concerned, with the relevant top-ups and ensure that they are able to continue to live in flats. This is the first.",1,193,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00193
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And secondly, that is precisely why we have a Home for Life requirement. So, you have to choose the right lease to retain, but that must take you to at least age 95. And that provides some assurance. Though, of course, longevity is a blessing. And we will make sure that for seniors who outlive their lease, that with the necessary top-ups and support, we will be able to provide them with housing.",2,194,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00194
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On the Member's first point, how to ramp up take-up of the Lease Buyback Scheme, that is how I hear him. There are many reasons why the Lease Buyback Scheme take-up is as it is. The numbers have been growing over the years, partly, due to greater awareness of the scheme, greater understanding of its details, but also because of the adjustments that have been made to the scheme over the years.",3,195,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00195
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Some seniors may have their own savings, they may have children who support them. Some seniors would prefer other monetisation options, such as renting out a room, renting out their whole flat, staying with their children in the meantime. Some want to age-in-place, but I am sure, in your house visits, you have heard of seniors who said, ""Well, I am an empty nester. My children have all set up their own home and this flat is just too big for me to manage. I want to right-size, so that it is more manageable, more cozy"". But they want a smaller flat in their neighbourhood that they are familiar in.",4,196,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00196
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, ageing-in-place is not just about living in the same flat, though many view it as such. But others view ageing-in-place as ageing in a more manageable, smaller flat, in the same community, in the same estate, familiar with their neighbours, familiar with the shopkeepers and the surroundings.",5,197,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00197
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"That is why, in addition to the Lease Buyback Scheme, we also have the Silver Housing Bonus to help those who right-size.",6,198,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00198
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But the Member is right that we want to make sure that our seniors are aware of this option and understand the details. There is some degree of technicality in Lease Buyback Scheme. And, so, we work with media outlets, we organise public talks and seminars in English and in vernacular. We do mini exhibitions and also enquiry booths at local community events to help spread the word about Lease Buyback Scheme.",7,199,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00199
2022-11-07-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Seniors who are interested in the Lease Buyback Scheme or at least interested to understand this option, just need to call up HDB's branch office or branch service line to arrange a financial counselling session. At these sessions, HDB will explain personalised information on their options – so, very specific to the senior, such as the different lease lengths they qualify for and the indicative proceeds for these options. And if seniors need time to consider or have further questions, HDB will gladly arrange another appointment to offer further advice.",8,200,2022-11-07-T-010-S-00200
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the feedback from stakeholders of the Kampung Admiralty project; (b) whether the Ministry has plans to expand the number of ""vertical kampungs"" to better prepare the nation for an ageing population; and (c) if so, when and where will these projects be undertaken.",1,201,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00201
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Sir, Kampung Admiralty is a first-of-its-kind development, which integrates housing for the elderly with a wide range of social, healthcare, communal, commercial and retail facilities. As the name suggests, we hope to foster a “kampung” spirit where residents of all ages live, interact and look out for one another. Feedback and outcomes from the project have been positive.",1,202,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00202
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"For instance, residents indicate that they feel a strong sense of well-being and belonging to their community. They also experienced high satisfaction in terms of ease of mobility, maintenance and safety in their estates. Service providers also reported that the co-location of facilities and close proximity to residents enabled them to form better partnerships with one another, especially when organising intergenerational activities.",2,203,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00203
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Following the success of Kampung Admiralty, HDB launched the next integrated development, Heart of Yew Tee, at Yew Tee Close in 2021. This development will integrate housing for the elderly with community facilities, such as a hawker centre, polyclinic, community club and a kidney dialysis centre.",3,204,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00204
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"HDB will continue to explore opportunities to develop more of such “vertical kampungs”, to foster stronger community bonds amongst Singaporeans, taking into consideration the availability of suitable sites and the needs of residents.",4,205,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00205
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Beyond launching such integrated developments, HDB also takes a concerted approach in designing our residential spaces to encourage inter-generational bonding and bring greater convenience to our residents, for example, by co-locating childcare and eldercare facilities, where possible, in new BTO developments. For the upcoming November BTO exercise, we will be launching our second Community Care Apartments (CCAs) pilot situated within the Health District at Queenstown. CCAs will be built together with the BTO flats in the same precinct, promoting intergenerational bonding as seniors living at CCAs and young families living nearby will all be part of the same community.",5,206,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00206
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),I thank the Minister for his response. I have two points for clarification.,1,207,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00207
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, clearly, there is a very strong demand for such integrated projects. May I ask the Minister what is the approximate demand and whether we will be able to supply and meet that demand for vertical kampungs around the island? Certainly, many of the residents in Tampines do look forward to that.",2,208,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00208
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, I am very glad to hear about the different community care type of housing that is being built, obviously, taking into consideration that it is not possible to build all new ones. What is the scope to repurpose existing flats by adding new facilities to create them into kampungs even within existing flats?",3,209,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00209
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As I mentioned, integrated kampungs like Kampung Admiralty and the upcoming Heart of Yew Tee are efforts to vertically integrate services that we think would be beneficial to our seniors, beneficial to intergenerational bonding and also beneficial to social and community partners who want to work much closer together to support our seniors. These kinds of developments, we have got one more coming up. We will look at opportunities to develop more, where possible. But, again, it depends on land availability. And as we study the first and, of course, the upcoming Heart of Yew Tee project, we continue to glean learnings from that as we look for opportunities to try out further integrated kampung-type amenities. Principally, they also save land by maximising the plot of land.",1,210,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00210
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member asked about whether it is possible to repurpose existing flats. That has been our effort all this while. For seniors, there is a whole range of options – ageing in place, as I discussed earlier with Mr Liang Eng Hwa, both living in their existing flats and having monetisation options but also downsizing to a smaller flat and getting a Silver Housing Bonus. For those who live in situ, we have the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme where we put in grab bars, non-slip flooring in the toilet, ramps and, even in the front of the flat, wheelchair lifters and ramps for wheelchairs, if necessary. And will continue to study what more can be done in order to make our homes more senior-friendly. In that regard, HDB works very closely with the Agency for Integrated Care and the community to support our seniors living in situ, living in their existing flats.",2,211,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00211
2022-11-07-T-011,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But, already, we have in the community active ageing centres, eldercare centres that provide programming as well as some degree of care for our seniors. And that is work that we do very closely with MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care and we will continue to see how we can further strengthen the tie-up between the social and community facility for seniors, surrounding partners and community agencies and RCs.",3,212,2022-11-07-T-011-S-00212
2022-11-07-T-012,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether more handicap-accessible car park lots will be provided at HDB and URA-managed car parks to provide for an accessible built environment; and (b) when is the next review on the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment.,1,213,2022-11-07-T-012-S-00213

Developments with more than 10 parking lots are required to provide one accessible lot for every 50 lots of the first 100 lots and one accessible lot for every subsequent 200 lots or part thereof.",1,214,2022-11-07-T-012-S-00214

The number of lots provided in HDB’s car parks is in accordance with the Code. URA car parks, which are typically off-street or curbside parking that are not part of a development, also take guidance from the Code for the provision of accessible parking lots. HDB and URA will also consider providing more accessible lots in their car parks based on public feedback and where it is feasible to do so.",2,215,2022-11-07-T-012-S-00215

2022-11-07-T-012,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Just a quick supplementary question for the Minister of State. I raised this Parliamentary Question because I have more and more residents coming to me to say that in the places that they go to, for those who are physically immobile, they are finding it sometimes not so easy to find the lots that they have. Obviously, we do know that more of us are ageing, more of us do need these aids and, therefore, planning parameters do need to change. I recognise that the next review is next year, in 2023, as the Minister of State just said. I hope that, in the review, we will do with a more future-back kind of lens because I think this ageing trend is taking place very, very quickly. And it is better to plan ahead and have a little bit of buffer, rather than having to do a bit of catch-up.",1,217,2022-11-07-T-012-S-00217

2022-11-07-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"MHA takes a very serious view of abuse and harassment of security officers. In October 2021, MHA amended the Private Security Industry Act (PSIA) to enhance protections for them. New offences addressing the common types of abuse and harassment were introduced, with penalties pegged higher than if they were committed against general members of the public. The amendments have been in force since May 2022. Given that it has only been six months since, it is too early to conclude on their impact. Nevertheless, anecdotally, the new legal provisions have enhanced awareness among security officers of the protections afforded to them, and have encouraged them and their employers to come forward to report incidents of abuse or harassment.",1,223,2022-11-07-T-013-S-00223
2022-11-07-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Preventing and deterring abuse and harassment of security officers requires the whole of society. The nature of their work, which could involve restricting access to premises, crowd control and conflict mediation, invariably exposes them to greater risk of confrontation with people. Unfortunately, there are individuals who may respond irrationally and unreasonably to requests and directions given by security officers, with some even causing physical hurt.",2,224,2022-11-07-T-013-S-00224
2022-11-07-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Security agencies and service buyers play key roles in protecting their security officers. We are heartened to see that many are leveraging technology to create more productive and safer working environments. For example, there are now more security officers equipped with body-worn cameras while on duty. From 2019 to October 2022, the Police approved 46 requests by 16 licensed security agencies for the use of body-worn cameras. The use of such cameras will allow for better onsite management and the additional evidence from the footages will facilitate investigations into allegations of abuse.",3,225,2022-11-07-T-013-S-00225
2022-11-07-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"But even with more pervasive use of technology, abuse can still happen. This is why we need to enhance training for security officers so that they can better protect themselves. MHA and the Police have been working with the tripartite partners to enhance the competency of security officers in public engagement and conflict management, such as customer orientation, problem solving and de-escalation skills. We will make these subjects more pertinent in the training that all security officers undergo before deployment and assess how it can also be incorporated into refreshers for in-service officers.",4,226,2022-11-07-T-013-S-00226
2022-11-07-T-013,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Finally, we work with the tripartite partners on public education to reinforce the message that abuse of security officers will not be condoned.

2022-11-07-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"First, given that the working conditions for our security officers do result in them being susceptible to abuse, can MHA revisit my suggestion to have body-worn cameras mandated for certain higher-risk frontline security officers while they are on duty? As the Minister of State has alluded to in her reply, body-worn cameras have proven to reduce incidences of abuse against the wearer and we should extend this protection to more security officers to enhance their safety.",2,230,2022-11-07-T-013-S-00230

Indeed, we fully agree with the Member that the wearing of body-worn cameras greatly improves the safety of our security officers. As I mentioned in my main reply, it also aids when it comes to investigations, potential liabilities. And that liability not only extends to the security officer himself but also the agency that he is working for. We do see that, as part of the security ITM, buyers and security agencies are encouraged to implement security solutions that help to integrate manpower, technology as well as process improvements. And it is worth noting that security agencies have been investing more in technology since the start of the ITM. For instance, today, 97% of security agencies use at least one technology solution, such as mobile-enabled patrol and incident management systems as well as the use of wearable technology, like what the Member mentioned, body-worn cameras. That said, on whether or not to make body-worn cameras compulsory, these are issues to be discussed between the service buyer and the service provider.

2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The Government will help all Singaporeans adjust to the GST increase, especially the less well-off. We will help every Singaporean family through the Assurance Package. We had already planned for this at the same time as we planned for the GST rate increase. Members will know that at Budget 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Heng and then-Finance Minister set aside $6 billion for the Assurance Package. At this year's Budget, I enhanced the package by $640 million.",10,250,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00250
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"With the Assurance Package, we had committed that the majority of Singaporean households will not feel the impact of the GST increase for at least five years and that lower-income households will not feel the impact for about 10 years. Put another way, they will effectively not face additional GST expenses for many years. So, we will continue to uphold these commitments even as the inflationary outlook evolves.",11,251,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00251
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Let me illustrate what I mean. In my Budget Statement, I gave an example of a middle-income family of four with two school-going children, living in a 4-room flat and earning a monthly household income of around $8,000. At that time, we estimated that they will incur GST on household expenses of around $3,400 a month, or $40,000 a year. With a two percentage-point increase in GST, this means their additional GST expenses would amount to around $800 per year. Under the Assurance Package, the family would have received around $4,000 in benefits. So, $4,000 in benefits, compared to $800 in additional expenses per year, that is about five times, which means that the Government pays about five years’ worth of the family’s additional GST. That was the computation we made earlier this year in the Budget.",12,252,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00252
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"With higher inflation this year and in the coming years, we can expect that the household expenditure and therefore the additional GST expenses will increase. The size of the Assurance Package will therefore need to be correspondingly increased to meet our committed levels of offsets.",13,253,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00253
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Therefore, after reviewing the elevated inflation situation, I have decided to top up the Assurance Package by another $1.4 billion to reach around $8 billion. This ensures that the package continues to offset additional GST expenses for the majority of Singaporean households for at least five years, with around 10 years offset for lower-income households. I will share the details of this enhancement in my Budget Statement next year.",14,254,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00254
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, for those who ask the Government to delay the GST rate increase, the Assurance Package in effect does precisely that, for the majority of households. The cash and other forms of support under the Assurance Package amount to more than what most citizens will pay in additional GST for at least five years.",15,255,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00255
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),I have explained how the Assurance Package works and how it is for all Singaporean households and provides a cushion to ease the transition. Let me now turn to another important design feature of the GST system in Singapore – which is our permanent GST Voucher (GSTV) scheme and Government absorbing GST for subsidised education and healthcare services.,16,256,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00256
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Because people say the Assurance Package, no matter how generous is temporary. Yes, but they do not fully understand that there is also another important design feature of GST which is a permanent GSTV scheme and the absorption of GST for subsidised education and healthcare. Households already receive these offsets today and as permanent measures, they will continue alongside, and even after, the Assurance Package.",17,257,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00257

But if the accommodation is located abroad, then the supply of arranging the accommodation today is zero-rated, which means that it is not subject to GST.",27,267,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00267

The refinements seek to prevent double taxation, provide tax certainty, and ease the compliance burden of businesses. For example, to prevent double taxation, the refinements clarify that where overseas vendors procure services already charged with GST from Singapore suppliers and subsequently onward supply these same services to their own customers in Singapore, they need not charge GST on these onward supplies.

2022-11-07-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"To dive a little bit more, based on the Budget 2022 NIRC estimates of $21.5 billion, reducing the retained NIRC to 40% would mean more than $4 billion will not be going into past reserves for reinvesting. This would reduce the NIRC that we can generate for subsequent years, including next year, and the cumulative impact over time will be even more significant.",30,314,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00314

About three-fold increase in 10 years. We hope that NIRC can continue contribute more, not by changing the ratio but by growing this base amount of our reserves. If we have not saved enough in the past, the NIRC today would be even lower and we would end up needing higher taxes or we may have to cut spending and subsidies. Surely, we want this NIRC annuities to keep growing to fund more spending and to reduce future tax burden for Singaporeans.",31,315,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00315

More importantly, it does not take into account the potential outflows from BEPS, as there is a Pillar One and Pillar Two. There is no certainty that the revenue from BEPS Pillar Two will be as what the Workers' Party had produced in their calculations, as we cannot assume that companies will not shift their operations in response to the tax rate increases.",36,320,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00320

I have also looked at the Workers' Party's current proposal which, like I said earlier, there are some aspects that I do not disagree. But when I look at all things in totality, I still prefer the Government's approach, which is that we continually build a diversified and stable source of revenue with income tax, corporate tax, wealth tax, property tax, GST and others, and augment with NIRC that we have to meet our current and longer-term spending commitments and continue to grow our reserves as they are our only backstop for our survivability.",42,326,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00326

Overall operating revenues worked out to be $82.5 billion for FY2021 – $5.8 billion higher, compared to $76.6 billion as initially budgeted in Budget 2021 and $2.1 billion higher than the revised estimate of $80.4 billion as of Budget 2022.",5,335,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00335

Any unjustified increases might not be high enough to pass the threshold to be reported to the Committee Against Profiteering; and even if they do, the average consumer is hardly going to report the economy rice or nasi padang stall for a higher price than they expected.

It is nevertheless, difficult to envision conditions where the impending GST increase would not give rise to another bout of inflation. To be fair, the Government has tried to get ahead of this possibility by convening the Commitee Against Profiteering. This Committee is tasked with investigating feedback on unjustified price increases in essential items while using the GST hike as a cover. Yet the task in front of the Commitee to effectively adjudicate cases of profiteering when the global inflation environment has itself ran amok, seems nigh well impossible. After all, how can we reasonably expect the Commitee to successfully disentangle the share of the price increase that is attributable to profiteering from a 1% GST hike when inflation itself is already running at more than seven times that rate?",9,414,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00414

Hence, if we now allow the rate of growth of healthcare expenditures to revert to its original trajectory of a steady 0.1% increase annually, we still have wiggle room to forestall an immediate increase in GST. After all, the $3.5 billion that a two-percentage point GST increase is expected to raise will amount to about 0.7% of current-day GDP, which is far greater than the projected increases needed by MOH for the couple of years ahead.",28,433,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00433

This is, in fact, true.

The crux of where we think we can raise an additional amount comes from property sales.",33,438,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00438

Rather, as we have explained we are using the Government's own treatment of land leases with tenure of less than 10 years, which currently gets directed to recurring revenues, and, instead, we are saying ""Let's take this, be consistent and take the full amount of the 10 years, whether the tenure of the land sales is for 30 years or 60 years or 99 years, and instead take that amount and put that into our recurrent revenue"".

Based on our calculations, we calculated that when the Government adjusted its NIRC contribution in 2008, it moved from about a contribution of 10% to the current 50%. Was it under-saving then? Would our proposal of going from 50% to 60% necessarily mean that we are still under-saving or are we over-saving? I think these should all be kept in mind.",37,442,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00442

Similarly, GST revenue will automatically be higher in dollar terms next year – even if it does not increase from the current rate of 7% – because GST will be levied on the higher sticker prices already being charged for goods and services.",40,445,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00445

Workers and unions are concerned the rising cost of living and the need to adapt to new ways of working. But their primary concern has always been  “Can their wages keep up with rising costs of living? Would the increase in GST worsen the cost-of-living problems?” The anxieties are real and lived, but workers also keenly understand that higher costs are here to stay and longer-term solutions are needed.",1,451,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00451

This was in addition to the $1.5 billion that was given out in June 2022. These short-term packages help to blunt the impact of sharp increases in costs during unprecedented inflation globally. We are also mindful that the Assurance Package will still be in place to support workers when GST kicks in next year. It was $6.6 billion; it will be boosted to $8 billion. Workers are assured that if inflation remains high, Government will continue to support them. My fellow Labour Member of Parliament, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, will share how these packages have helped our lower-wage and our self-employed workers to cope.",3,453,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00453
2022-11-07-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"We cannot rely on special packages indefinitely. The lasting solution is we must keep wages growing ahead of inflation sustainably. We appreciate that costs of doing business have increased. Singapore is a price-taker for virtually any items we import. We are price-takers for most of our factors of production. Therefore, we must not lose sight in driving productivity. We need to ensure that there is continued investment in companies and workers so that our economy is vibrant and productive.

2022-11-07-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Raising productivity is key but we must also make sure that gains are shared fairly and equitably. This is an important tenet of our social compact. There are workers, especially lower-wage ones, in sectors where market forces work against them. PWM has helped these workers to be paid better. It also helps to keep wage disparity tighter. It has served both economic and social purposes. We have expanded to the retail sector and workers will see around 8.5% wage increase. We will expand into food services and waste management next year. We will need to study expanding into other areas more rapidly to help our lower-wage workers.",9,459,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00459

Throughout the period of PWCS support, I hope businesses will use this period to devise new ways to attract local talent and increase productivity. Businesses should tap on grants to increase productivity. Examples of these grants – there are a lot of them – that seek to increase job productivity include the Productivity Solutions Grant which offers up to 80% support in the food services and retail sectors. There is also the NTUC Company Training Committee Grant which provides funding support of up to 70% of qualifying costs for each project and aims to enhance business capabilities.",10,460,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00460

We could do all this because firstly, there are investments to create new and better jobs; two, we have the resources to invest in our workers and care for Singaporeans.

2022-11-07-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"So, we must keep faith in investing in our workers for the long run to protect them against inflation. Similarly, we must reject short-term solutions that harm longer-term viability. Solutions such as consuming more of our NIRC now instead of investing them to meet future unpredictable challenges are very risky. More consumption today must also mean less to invest for future returns. This is inevitable.

In 2021, they rolled out another $20 million package to manage the cost of living and help stretch savings across different areas such as insurance, healthcare, education, and financial planning.

2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"In my speech during the Committee of Supply Debate in February, I have stated that the sandwich class would be paying $1.2 billion more as a result of the full implementation of the 2% GST hike at a time when they are facing challenges with soaring inflation and escalating housing prices. The Government, however, did not confirm or deny that figure.",5,486,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00486

2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Many would remember the story about Ah Seng and his grandfather, Ah Gong, told by former Member of Parliament Lee Bee Wah.

2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Story of Ah Seng – Second Episode. Ah Seng’s parents died when he was very young and he was brought up by his grandfather. Ah Seng was not a prodigal son or a ""see gui kia"" who only knew how to get money from his grandfather. Ever since Ah Seng started working, he had always been giving his grandfather a large proportion of his salary.",8,489,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00489
2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"After Ah Seng got married and had children, his expenses began to increase rapidly, but his grandfather continued to ask Ah Seng to increase his allowance. Grandfather had his reasons, like he needed money to pay his wife's medical bills, or because he needed money to refurbish the ancestral homes. Hence, all this while, Ah Seng carried a heavy financial burden and had limited cash savings.",9,490,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00490
2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"If the extended family was truly short of money, grandfather's requests would be reasonable. But as Ah Seng grew older, he realised that the extended family, headed by his grandfather, was doing pretty well financially, as their ancestors had left behind many properties and assets. However, the grandfather never revealed this to Ah Seng, and deliberately kept it as a secret.",10,491,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00491
2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"All this while, Ah Seng, who had a strong notion of self-reliance, had not given much thought to the ancestral assets. He did not complain even when he had to pay his grandfather the market price to purchase a house allocated to him out of the ancestral assets when he got married. At the time, the grandfather gave Ah Seng some money to help with the down payment, and Ah Seng borrowed money from banks to pay for the rest of the house. After that, the grandfather continually invest the proceeds from the sale of the house that he received from Ah Seng.",11,492,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00492
2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"As Ah Seng entered middle age, his career began to flounder and his income became unstable. The cost of living also began to rise precipitously. Under such circumstances, when grandfather again asked Ah Seng to increase his allowance, Ah Seng felt aggrieved, and started to feel some discontent towards his grandfather.",12,493,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00493
2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Furthermore, each time any family member questioned the grandfather about the ancestral assets, he would rage and call them spoilt children. He would warn them not to spout nonsense. Actually, Ah Seng agreed that they should leave behind more assets for the future generation, but not without addressing the urgent needs of the present generation.",13,494,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00494
2022-11-07-T-016,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Fellow Singaporeans, do you agree with the grandfather's behaviour? If you are Ah Seng, would you agree to his grandfather's request for an increase in allowance?",14,495,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00495

His story of Ah Gong and Ah Seng is very compelling. But it seems to only include two characters, which is Ah Gong and Ah Seng. In this particular story, has he considered other characters, for example, other family members, friends, visitors who have come to the house to visit, from whom Ah Gong would have collected a fair share of collective to increase the fiscal capacity to further help Ah Seng.",1,499,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00499

2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"During my block visits and conversation with the residents of Pasir Ris-Punggol, cost of living, healthcare and taking care of our increasingly ageing population are issues that weigh heavily on their minds. While we can all try to understand what is going on in the world today and explain the confluence of reasons for the global inflation, or how the Singaporean dollar has strengthened to reduce the net impact of inflation, all these explanations fade away when at the end of the day the price of our grocery bill is more expensive than what it was previously.",2,506,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00506
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, inflation is at an all-time high in Singapore. MAS expects headline inflation in 2022 to come between 5% and 6%, with core inflation to average between 3% and 4%. Prospects in 2023 do not look too rosy either. Economists expect inflation rates to ease but will remain high at 3.5%.",3,507,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00507
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),This comes with a forecasted slowdown in GDP growth. MTI narrowed its range for Singapore's GDP growth this year to 3% to 4% from an earlier projection of 3% to 5%. This was in tandem with a worsening outlook for the global economy and stubbornly high inflation globally.,4,508,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00508
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In my conversations with Pasir Ris residents, across the board, high inflation rates, cost of living and healthcare were top on everyone's worry. In a Public Policy Forum with youths at Pasir Ris East, our youths were concerned about the cost of living, affordability of healthcare for our seniors and the load of supporting our rapidly ageing population across a smaller base.",5,509,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00509
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"One of them, Mr Charles Chow, a young working professional, is concerned for the fact that four working adults are supporting one senior now; but by 2030, only two working adults will support one senior. What are the future financial challenges for working adults if this trend continues? He wonders how we can distribute the costs of providing affordable healthcare among a larger group of taxpayers.",6,510,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00510
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Last week, in a dialogue session with more than 70 members in the Malay/Muslim community through M3 Pasir Ris-Punggol, the top three concerns they had for the community were  rising cost, including assistance for low-income families; healthcare cost for our ageing population; and education for students from lower-income families.",7,511,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00511
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Many of the residents in my ward are between the ages of 55 and 65. Their children have only recently begun working, their homes will be paid for in the next few years, they have extensive work experience and they plan to retire soon. However, present inflation rates and rising costs of healthcare raise a real concern that their retirement account would prove insufficient. They worry that they would be a burden to their own children after retirement.",8,512,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00512
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We also have more ""middle-aged"" families. They are in their mid-30s or 40s with school-going kids and have relocated from their BTOs in Punggol or Sengkang to Pasir Ris to be closer to their parents who will retire soon. They are concerned about the rising cost of living for their family and the assistance available to care for their elderly parents. They feel sandwiched between their family and responsibility for their parents.",9,513,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00513
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In the last Budget debate in February this year, Deputy Prime Minister Wong highlighted that we almost tripled healthcare spending from $3.7 billion in 2010 to $11.3 billion in 2019. If our current healthcare spending continues to increase at a similar rate over the coming decade, we will spend around $27 billion by 2030.",10,514,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00514
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"How can we fund this increasing healthcare cost?

2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),We all agree that more must be done to keep healthcare affordable and provide greater assistance to lower-income families. We want more to be done without overburdening the lower- and middle-income. We believe that those who have been blessed with more should give back more to society.,12,516,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00516
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"So, what are our options to provide the necessary healthcare support for our rapidly ageing population while minimising the impact on the majority of Singaporeans?",13,517,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00517
2022-11-07-T-016,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In MOF's analysis of revenue and expenditure based on FY2021, about 70% of Singapore's revenue comes from NIRC, corporate tax, income tax and Goods and Services Tax. In his Budget speech, Deputy Prime Minister Wong mentioned the consideration of all the other types of taxes. Hence, I will not touch on them here. However, I would like to provide a perspective from the industry on corporate tax and, in particular, the impact of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS 2.0) and if this can be a dependable alternative to raise the additional income we require to finance the increasing healthcare cost.",14,518,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00518

The enhanced GST cash vouchers, GST U-Save rebates to offset utilities, S&CC rebates, MediSave top-ups for seniors and GST Seniors' Bonus means that many Singaporeans pay GST below the headline rate.

How do we then depend on something so uncertain to fund our increasing healthcare cost?

2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"But Sir, before I do so, I think it is even more important to re-examine why we are having a GST hike. Of course, we all know a GST hike is never politically popular at any point in time anywhere. But in Singapore, the PAP has always done what we think is in the best interest of Singapore now and for successive generations; sometimes, regardless of the political cost. That is why we are where we are today.",3,570,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00570
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The first principle in terms of taxes and expenditure is that each generation must, as far as possible, bear the cost of the public services it consumes. That should not be an inter-generation transfer of liabilities such that one generation pays for the services consumed by another generation. It is surely not a ""pay as you go"" arrangement that we see in other countries. This is the slippery slope that we must not go down and there are many examples of this elsewhere. Eventually, it pits one generation against another and leads to society fissuring and even fracturing along generation lines.

If we drop to 40% to reserves, what is there to say we cannot drop to 30% or even 20%?",5,572,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00572

We are an Asian society and generally speaking, our forebears have tried very hard to give us a better life than what they went through. This is possible only because they consumed less than what they produced and left us with the rest. We should continue this good practice of leaving something for our descendants.",6,573,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00573
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"So, at this juncture, I would like to take a pause and comment on some of the speeches that were made earlier. The hon Member Mr Louis Chua likened a GST increase to scoring an own goal when you are 5-0 down in football. When he said that, I am reminded of the Suzuki Cup semi-finals last year, on Christmas Day, where I was there with Minister Edwin Tong and which Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also mentioned during his Budget speech. In that game on Christmas Day last year, our Lions lost 4-2 against Indonesia. We had one man sent off, two men sent off, three men sent off. We were down to eight men. Our back was against the wall. But the Young Lions battled, they were clearing shots off the line, they defended stoutly and they were throwing bodies all around. That is how Team Singapore play. Not the way that Mr Chua has spoken about – conceding an own goal or scoring an own goal when you are 5-0 down.",7,574,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00574
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Speaker, Sir. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also made mention of over-saving for our reserves. For a small country like Singapore, there is no such thing as over-saving. We are not just saving, we are re-investing. We are then flowing it back to the NIRC of future generations. Just a short while ago, I see a group of students in our audience; they just left. But why do you think even in such turbulent times, we are able to invest in education, to invest for the future? It is precisely because of the reserves that our forefathers had given us. So, let us not kid around. There is no such thing as under-saving or over-saving for a small country like Singapore. We have to save as much as we can, and I dare say, for a small country like ours, do what you can and do not ever use that word ""over-saving"", please.",8,575,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00575
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Speaker, Sir. I will go back to my speech now. If I have time, I would like to say something on Mr Leong Mun Wai's speech but let us see.",9,576,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00576
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, the argument against the GST hike, as some have said, is that times are hard, we are experiencing terrible headwinds and people are suffering from the rising cost of living. I recognise that. We all know that. I am sure the Government knows that both in their hearts and their minds. So, what is their solution?",10,577,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00577
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Here I am reminded of what a doctor friend told me. I learnt a new word. The difference between analgesia – I hope I pronounced it correctly – analgesia and pain relief. Analgesia is the absence of pain. For example, an anesthetist is trained to achieve analgesia in a patient undergoing surgery. But when a patient is in this state, he needs constant monitoring and this consumes a lot of resources. It is not possible to have a long period of time whereby a patient feels no pain. This is because pain is a sensation and not to have any sensation is dangerous. While we do not like pain at all, a little pain is necessary because it is what makes us alert, it is what keeps us alive. To have no sensation of pain, unless induced by a doctor through anesthetic intervention for a short while, is not good at all. A good example is a person with badly controlled diabetes. Often, he has no sensation in his lower extremities because his nerves have died due to the scourge of diabetes. He feels no pain. Not just pain, he actually also feels nothing at all in the area where the nerves have died. As a result, he may not know he has developed bad diabetic ulcers, which can sadly end up with an amputation of a part of the leg. He may even die from these painless diabetic ulcers.",11,578,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00578
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"So, in summary, only the deceased feel nothing for a long period of time. It is therefore neither possible nor advisable that the Government shield Singaporeans from difficult economic conditions worldwide, so that they feel no pain at all. It is also not responsible for the Government of this generation to spend more than its fair share so that this generation of Singaporeans feel no pain. The can is kicked down the road and subsequent generations have to feel additional pain because of the profligacy that takes place now.",12,579,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00579
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I know this sounds somewhat harsh, but reality is like that. No one owes Singapore a living. We must be prudent so that we are always resilient, no matter what or how the global climate is. Any good government must understand this. Only then can we bounce back from difficult challenges and grow even stronger in the future.",13,580,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00580
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"But it is also vital that the Government also feels for and understands the pain of Singaporeans during such challenging times. What the PAP aims to do is to reduce the pain, as in providing effective and substantial pain relief. Where the pain is most severe and sharpest, we will give the most pain relief through targeted assistance schemes. But we cannot provide analgesia so that we do not feel, at all, the adverse conditions around us. That would obtund us to the point that we may have a festering wound threatening our lives in the long term and yet we are not aware of it. We may then die from it eventually, or at the very least, we may need drastic intervention not unlike chopping off a part of our limbs. That would be a disastrous outcome that we need to prevent.",14,581,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00581
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"We are here to help.

2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, the GST hike is implemented to help balance the books. But at a deeper level, the hike reminds us, both the Government and the individual, that we need to remain prudent in our consumption behaviour and that the world is going through tough economic times. But I must say, this does not stop the Government from intervening decisively to help families and individuals to lessen the pain in these trying times. And I think that the Government has shown, through the years, that no matter how challenging the internal or external environment is, we will continue to support Singapore and Singaporeans on the cost of living here. Even with the impending GST hike, the Assurance Package and Enhanced GSTV scheme effectively buffer many Singaporeans from the increase.",16,583,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00583
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, the fundamental difference between how the PAP and the Workers' Party approaches the problem is really this  the Workers' Party wants to provide analgesia for an extended period of time. The question is whether we, as a country, are better off and more resilient if we take this approach? Or are we better off if we take the PAP’s approach, which is to keep the country alert to dangers and challenges, while we give relief to those who are suffering more, as we forge ahead through these difficult waters?",17,584,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00584
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Speaker, I think that the answers are clear. Planning for the long-term interest of successive generations of Singaporeans, always ensuring that Singapore remains resilient through choppy waters, while at the same time, supporting Singaporeans in facing the challenges of today, is surely a better, more holistic approach than providing analgesia to numb the senses so that we can all pretend that the pain does not exist.",18,585,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00585

2022-11-07-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My point is that if I understood his speech correctly, he is saying that measures to ameliorate the negative impact of GST on the population are, in a way, kicking the can down the road or somehow dishonest because actually the population should feel the pain. And we should not try to take measures that are alternatives to that – even though there are viable alternatives that we believe, which we have put forward as proposals, relating to NIR, relating to land sales, for example – we should not take that route. Rather, we should allow the population to experience more pain. That is what I understood what the Member was saying.",2,598,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00598
2022-11-07-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"So, in that light, I would like to ask him whether some of the ameliorating measures that the Government has proposed will also fall into the same category.",3,599,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00599

In fact, I think they are very helpful and the Government is targeting it at the people who need it most. I did not say we deserve to go through this pain. What I am saying is that in these turbulent times of calamity, we have to bond together as a nation and we have to go through this together – 同甘共苦的精神, the spirit of sharing weal and woe – if the Member knows what I mean.",2,601,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00601

2022-11-07-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"If we take this argument to his own logical extreme, why do we not simply just lower our NIRC ceiling to 0% and not tap on NIRC at all?",2,604,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00604
2022-11-07-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Let me put it another way. If we think there is no such thing as over-saving, is he saying that the Government of 2008, having tapped on a lower percentage, actually under-saved?

2022-11-07-T-016,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"In 2008, as far as I believe, the Government altered its NIRC contribution percentage.

Our own calculations suggest that it went from somewhere in the order of 10% or 20% of the NIRC contribution up to the present rate of 50%.",1,614,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00614

2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the issue here is not about the NIRC. As far as I know, the Workers' Party agrees with having the NIRC system and so do I. It is a good system to have. But the question that they have posed is should we have 50-50 or should we allow 60% to be used as expenditure.",1,616,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00616
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"I completely agree that the NIRC system is a good system. It is here to stay. For now, I think 50-50 is about right. It is fair.",2,617,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00617
2022-11-07-T-016,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Leon Perera asked a question earlier after Mr Liang Eng Hwa's speech. I think he asked about what if 50-50 is not enough. Well, we have a mechanism, right? If using 50% of NIRC is not enough, there is a mechanism for the Government to tap on the reserves, with the permission of the President. I think our system works perfectly well.",3,618,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00618

2022-11-07-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I think the question was really, if we heard the hon Member correctly in his speech, the hon Member said that there can be no such thing, in theory, by definition, as over-saving for a small country like Singapore.

2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"GST is a tax on consumption. Although Singapore's GST rate, even at 9%, is amongst the lowest in the world, an increase in GST will still impact all Singaporeans and all Singaporean households, regardless of income levels.

2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"While none of us likes an increase in GST, it is reassuring to know that with the Assurance Package, the majority of Singaporean households will not feel the impact of the GST increase for at least five years. For lower-income families, the Assurance Package will delay the impact of the GST increase by about 10 years.",3,630,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00630
2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I thank Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong for recognising the challenges and the inflationary pressures that Singaporeans are facing and for his reassurance that the adequacy of the Assurance Package will be assessed and, if the situation requires, more support will be provided – as what he has announced today, the increase of the $1.4 billion in the Assurance Package to stand at $8 billion today.",4,631,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00631

2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In my Budget debate speech earlier this year, I had highlighted the point about the eligibility criteria for the support, which I wish to reiterate. The annual value (AV) of residence or your home address is used as the main criterion for means testing and eligibility for many of our support schemes. I agree that we need to do means testing and that those who are less well-off and vulnerable must get more support.",6,633,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00633
2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In the cash payout component of the Assurance Package, there is a change in the eligibility criteria where eligibility and the amount of the cash payout component of the Assurance Package are based on annual income and property ownership, instead of the annual value of residence. What this means is that with the cash payout of the Assurance Package, every adult Singaporean aged 21 and above, depending on assessable annual income and home ownership, will get a total cash payout of between $700 and $1,600 over five years from December this year to 2026 to offset the additional GST expenses.",7,634,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00634

2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),I was looking at the $700 – the lowest of the categories in these payouts – just to get a sense of what that means for the individual.

2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"What it means, really, is, if someone falls into the category of getting $700 over the five years, what it means is that, for each year, that person will receive a $140 offset. That means that $140 a year will offset 2% of the GST increase over the five years, which, effectively, means that for a spending of $580 a month for each individual – this is just the cash payout component – you will not be paying GST. So, it is not insignificant. It may not cover everything, but it is not insignificant. And it is also just one of the components.",10,637,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00637

2022-11-07-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"A point that I have raised several times in this House is the application of the annual value criterion for those who live with their extended families in properties with annual values above the eligibility criterion of $21,000. These persons could be elderly parents or siblings who live with relatives as they need care or cannot afford housing. In several of these cases, they do not have means.

For those who have seen the award-winning film, Parasite, we would be familiar with the basement apartments in South Korea. When the floodwaters rush in, people living in these humble dwellings get their homes destroyed and, worse, lose their lives.

When it hits, the lives and livelihoods of those at the bottom are the first to be put to the sword – all the way up to the middle of the ladder, we have Singaporeans up to their necks with surging prices on living necessities. Of course, I could have spared the analogy, for this is basic economic theory. Yes, basic, but, for many of us, it merely remains in theory. For lower- to middle-income working Singaporeans, rising GST rates will be felt in the flesh.",2,686,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00686

These measures will tide Singaporeans over fiscal challenges as they navigate the rising cost of living in the near-term, and the Union brothers and sisters I have spoken with are grateful for this support on behalf of our Singaporean workers. However, while such assistance provides relief, we must continue to look to policies that imbue resilience. Rising costs are, undoubtedly, a perennial issue – every generation reminisces about the prices of their kopi, a bowl of noodles back in their day. We can choose to look on and rue rising prices like sitting ducks or match the rising cost of living with increased productivity and fortified wages undergirded by the equitable and sustainable gains sharing.",3,687,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00687
2022-11-07-T-016,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"That is exactly why the Union has thrown its weight behind the rollout and expansion of the Progressive Wage Model, deepening its reach in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors, as well as being newly implemented in the retail sector in September this year, with the Food Services sector following very closely in six months' time and more sectors to come in the months ahead. We are encouraged by the Government’s commitment to resilience-building on top of mere relief-provisions as seen in the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS) introduced during Budget 2022. PWCS served to encourage salary increments for lower-wage workers despite the poor macroeconomic climate, incentivising, therefore, lower-wage workers’ investment in the development of their craft. As the cost of living rises, we are confident that Singaporeans will be well-resourced to match its demands for greater productivity in a sustainable gain-sharing ecosystem.",4,688,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00688

While established corporations have elaborate pricing models to capture profits amidst the volatile economic climate, small business owners in Singapore feel a special affinity for their customer base and have an often overlooked obligation to their regulars to keep prices down. It is not uncommon to hear residents name their favourite food after their associated prices. Think the “$2.50 chicken rice” or the “$1 banana leaf nasi lemak”. Those dishes just have a special ring to it. In our communities, small business owners who have fought to keep their prices down to keep serving their loyal customers are celebrated as community stalwarts, and treasure this trust more than just gouging profits. Many of these small businesses, Mr Speaker, also happen to be not GST-registered, meaning that they are unable to charge GST and claim GST costs. As their suppliers pass the increasing costs of goods down to these small business owners in light of the rising GST rates, small business owners can, at best, apologetically raise their prices, or, at worst, absorb these costs out of their pockets to their own personal detriment. This dilemma is one unique to small business owners in Singapore and need not be the one that we put them through if we pull the right policy levers.",7,691,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00691

Our drivers from the National Taxi Association and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association have told me that they are worried about the impending GST increments and thus affecting their daily takings and livelihoods. The costs of doing business would go up, from larger dollar items, such as fuel, car rentals, insurance, to the smallest of purchases essential to their businesses, such as masks and even sanitation wipes. Our drivers, being price takers, and individually not earning enough to be GST-registered, what more can we do to cushion the impact of rising costs handed down to them from upstream stakeholders?

Perhaps this allowance can be extended to a basket of low-value goods and can be considered and reset on an annual basis. This discernment in the application of GST will go a long way to supporting our SMEs and the self-employed who might feel cornered by the GST increase.

The culpability for this strict-liability offence is lower and this offence attracts lower penalties than the one for participation.

2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"What is salient and is key is that, taken holistically, the support packages transform the GST scheme into a tiered consumption tax system.",12,721,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00721
2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In the prospective regime, the lower-income, including retirees, continue to pay an effective GST rate of zero to 3%, the middle segment or those with per capita household income from $2,000 to $4,000 will pay around four to 7%, of which 7% is already the existing GST rate. It is actually the higher income who will pay closer to the new headline rate of 9%.",13,722,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00722
2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"There were suggestions in this House to consider further increasing taxes paid by those in the higher income segment, in place of this proposed GST Bill. However, this proposed GST system, when taken holistically, in fact, taxes those in the higher income significantly more, not only at a higher effective rate, but also because of their relatively higher consumption and, therefore, significantly more spending on luxury goods.",14,723,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00723

2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Shifting to the focus on businesses, I understand through the Association of Trade and Commerce the concerns expressed by smaller SMEs. They, generally, worry about cost increases. In particular, those who are non-GST-registered cannot claim GST expenses paid to GST-registered suppliers. Some considered voluntary GST registration but find it difficult to comply with the requirements due to limited resources. Against this, can the Deputy Prime Minister share if there will be further support for smaller SMEs to better navigate the GST rate change?",19,728,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00728
2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In the longer term, should economic uncertainties persist and result in lower tax receipts even after the GST increase, can the Deputy Prime Minister share what are other potential levers to ensure we can keep up with our long-term expenditure needs? Can the Government assure us that the GST rate will not increase beyond 9% in the near term? Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.",20,729,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00729
2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, as our society spends more and more, it is necessary to raise the GST. However, with inflation and cost of living rising, I am worried that residents will not be able to bear the cost. Therefore, I have examined our GST system very carefully. If we include the GST and the various assistance packages such as the $6.6 billion Assurance Package and the annual GST Vouchers, it is estimated that the actual GST paid by the low-income and retirees is between 0% to 3% and that for the middle-income is 4% to 7%. Only those high-income earners will have to pay 7% to 9% GST. I believe that Singapore's GST system, with its unique design, is more in depth and layered. It can help to address the challenges faced by Singapore in a more practical manner while taking care of the needs of Singaporeans at the same time.",21,730,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00730
2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Nevertheless, to Singaporeans, the burden of the cost of living is already very heavy now. I can understand their concerns about raising GST at this juncture. I am very glad that the Government has done its part to help Singaporeans when it is needed as they have promised to do so. For example, the two additional Assistance Packages announced in June and October this year will help Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living.",22,731,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00731
2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The Deputy Prime Minister has also just announced that the Government will announce the updated Assurance Package next year.

2022-11-07-T-016,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Lastly, I hope that the Government can further help local SMEs. Some small business operators will also face pressures because of the increase in GST as their costs will go up. However, they are also worried that if they raise their prices, they will be seen as profiteering and that their old customers will not accept the new prices. I believe that the Government will not forget our SMEs.",24,733,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00733

And I want to offer some constructive suggestions to Mr Leong so that the next time he tells this story, it can be more accurate and more complete.",2,741,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00741
2022-11-07-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Mr Speaker, Mr Leong mentioned the story of Ah Gong and Ah Seng. We know that in Singapore society, it is more accurate to say that the money Ah Seng gives to Ah Gong is less than the money Ah Gong gives to Ah Seng. As my Parliament colleague Mr Shawn Huang mentioned just now, if Ah Seng is from the lower-income group, for every one dollar of tax that he pays to Ah Gong, he will receive $4 in benefits. If Ah Seng is middle-income, every dollar that he pays to Ah Gong, he will receive $2 in benefits.",3,742,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00742

2022-11-07-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Secondly, Ah Gong and Ah Ma have worked very hard for many years to save some money, not for them to spend frivolously, but for Ah Seng and Ah Seng's children and their future generations. In fact, part of Ah Seng’s expenditure every year comes from the returns of the invested savings that Ah Gong and Ah Ma have accumulated. 50% of the returns are spent on Ah Seng and his family, while the other half is put back into the savings, so that the savings can grow and achieve more returns in future. For every $5 Ah Seng needs every year, $1 comes from the 50% of the returns of Ah Gong's investment.",5,744,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00744
2022-11-07-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Thirdly, Mr Leong mentioned that Ah Ma is already old. She is not so healthy. Healthcare costs have increased, and Ah Ma needs someone to take care of her. I feel that Ah Gong and Ah Ma have worked so hard to take care of Ah Seng and bring him up, now that Ah Gong and Ah Ma have aged, it is time that Ah Seng takes care of them. This is the right way as filial piety is a virtue in Asian societies.",6,745,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00745
2022-11-07-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"For Ah Gong, he has been very understanding of the difficulties that Ah Seng is facing.

Instead, he gave Ah Seng a buffer of five years or even 10 years to help him tide through the challenges.",7,746,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00746
2022-11-07-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Mr Speaker, I mentioned that Ah Gong and Ah Ma have worked so hard for many years, and whom are they working for?

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Where we come apart, clearly, is whether GST should, and can be, a source of revenue.

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let me try and answer this by offering a historical perspective. In 1993, the GST Bill was introduced in this House. Then, as now, it was an unpopular move. Then, as now, there were good reasons to do so – we needed to strengthen our tax base to ensure that our tax structure was resilient and promote enterprise and growth.",7,755,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00755
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In 1993, direct taxes made up about 60% of our tax revenue, of which 73% was income and corporate tax. Introducing a consumption tax would keep Singapore competitive and also allow us a stable and diversified stream of tax revenues and allow us to invest more heavily in growth. The WP raised strenuous objections to its passing.",8,756,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00756
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The hon Member then, Mr Low Thia Khiang, in his speech, felt that there was no basis to suggest that high income and corporate taxes had the effect of driving talent and entrepreneurism away. He was concerned about the regressive nature of the tax, especially on low-income people.",9,757,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00757
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The PAP's response was to recognise the possible shortcomings and work in policy fixes, such as GST offsets for low-income households. GST was introduced on 1 April 1994 and what happened thereafter? Historically, the rate of corporate and personal income taxes was at 40% before 1985; this came down to 33% after the recession in 1985. After GST was enacted, it came down further, to 28%, now it is up to 24% for personal income tax and 17% for corporate tax.",10,758,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00758
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In fact, the majority of Singaporeans do not pay income tax. In the meantime, our Government grew our economy by leaps and bounds.

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In other words, whatever the hon Ministers then, Dr Richard Hu and Mr S Dhanabalan, said on behalf of the Government on that occasion in 1993 would happen, happened. Our tax rates went down, our tax revenues did not. Our social spending went up – benefiting the poorest amongst us the most.

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the issue of timing, it should be borne in mind that, in 1993, there were strong economic growth and budgetary surpluses. It could have been argued that there was no pressing need to pass the GST Act. But when you cast your eyes into the long-term, your perspective changes. In 1993, when our economy was strong and our people were young, it was already felt that GST was needed for the long term. Today, when we are older and the economy is struggling, it turns out that our 1993 decision was correct.",13,761,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00761
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I then fast forward to 2003. Those were tough times, more like 2022.

Then, like now, some voices had suggested to defer, but that will heighten the risk of leaving the Government with insufficient funds for healthcare, education and defence. Singapore would then be in a structural deficit.

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"They said, and I quote  ""Political courage means recognising that the facts and assumptions that supported an earlier decision have changed... Political courage means being able to recognise that contrary arguments have merit, even though those arguments come from one's political opponents. Political courage means not opposing for the sake of opposing.""",31,779,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00779
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I have no trouble with the statements, but, surely, this applies both ways. History reveals that the WP has always been taking a conscientious objection to GST, regardless of the effects it has brought about. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim quoted about the Japanese experience of over 25 years to justify his proposition that GST will lead to runaway inflation.",32,780,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00780
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I thought it was noteworthy that he did not analyse the Singapore experience instead. Rhetoric, for effect, seldom helps. Political courage commands a price, but mere talk of political courage is cheap.",33,781,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00781
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I now come the crux of my decision. Objectively, what has happened in history favoured the PAP. What we are doing now, as a matter of approach, is no different. It is not just theory; it is almost 30 years of practice. It is clear to me that we will continue to have fiscal pressures. We will have to deal with it, failing which, we will pay a serious price. We also need to get the balance right, so as not to affect our attraction as a hub for talent and investments.",34,782,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00782
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"We just increased our personal income tax, property tax and vehicle tax. To be fair, this was something that the Workers' Party has broadly advocated for. To further increase these tax bases will upset this balance.",35,783,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00783
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I therefore support the increase in GST with the features and schemes addressed to help the less well-off. I also support the judgement call at this point not to deplete income from reserves through land sales and increasing the NIRC ceiling.,36,784,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00784
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It is asked how much is enough when it comes to our reserves. No one knows. And I join Mr Sitoh Yih Pin in expressing his view on the same matter. I remember this question came up in the last session of Parliament and I ventured to suggest – think of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Nobody expected it to happen, but it happened, and we had to deal with it.",37,785,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00785
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),There could be a collapse of an Antartica ice shelf and we will have to deal with the ramifications of it. We may have to accelerate the poder construction. All these cost money.,38,786,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00786

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The 50-50 NIRC ratio is equitable because it balances current needs with future needs, putting it on an equal platform. Tilting it in favour of current needs is, I think, selling our children too short.",40,788,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00788

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This is not to say current needs are unimportant. The Government is on record to say that no one will be left behind.

This twin approach must carry on at the same time – fiscal responsibility with inclusivity.",42,790,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00790
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"To argue that Government should sequence its actions is to ignore the reality that our Government has to just develop the tentacles to deal with all the multiple existential issues happening at the same time to steer our country out of stormy waters.

2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I asked how is it that the PAP and the WP, which are aligned on many points relating to the need for tax revenues, can be so far apart in assessment of whether or not a GST hike is the proper thing to do for our people.",44,792,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00792
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The answer lies partly in political principle and partly in a difference of political judgement.,45,793,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00793
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On political principle, we part ways on many counts, but just on the point of political courage, the WP sees it as courageous for the PAP to accept good ideas from the WP.",46,794,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00794
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The PAP does not. We see it as good sense. The PAP has pledged to do our best for Singaporeans and being in a small country, we must not care about the pedigree of ideas, merely about their quality. The Hansard is replete with illustrations where suggestions made across the aisle were accepted by the Government. One vivid example is WP's call to level the playing field for accused persons in 2020, which led to the passing of the Public Defenders Act this year.",47,795,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00795
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the other hand, what we see as true political courage in the context of a GST hike, the WP dismisses as being unnecessary or bad timing.",48,796,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00796
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"We are not so naive as to think that the GST will gain us political favour. We know that it will be a tough pill.

We ask this because there are hard, immovable economic and fiscal realities in public life that can be either sugarcoated beyond recognition or presented in their true form.",49,797,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00797
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The PAP's choice, from 1993 till 2022, has always been the latter. We do so as a matter of principle and also because of our deep and abiding faith in the Singaporean people to understand the need for these hard choices and why we have to make them. This is not mere theoretical conviction, but a judgement call born of years of experience in running the government and understanding the global marketplace.",50,798,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00798
2022-11-07-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),We ask this at this difficult time because we truly believe that it will give us a fairer and more progressive way of financing our government and build a stronger foundation for our nation.

2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken on the Bill. There were broadly two categories of questions. The first relates to the technical and operational aspects of the GST regime – I think not so many people spoke about that – but the other set of questions relates to the GST increase itself, which many more Members spoke about.",1,801,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00801
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Let me first address the technical and operational clarifications.,2,802,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00802
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Derrick Goh suggested that we do more to help small businesses register for GST voluntarily. I completely agree and we will do more. Today, seven in 10 businesses that newly register for GST already do so voluntarily. We will continue to help businesses who wish to register for GST to do so. There are support schemes under Enterprise Singapore. We will do more to engage SMEs on this.",3,803,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00803
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the GST transitional rules, Mr Saktiandi Supaat was concerned that smaller businesses might find it difficult to understand these rules.",4,804,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00804
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Again, we likewise share the concerns. We have been very mindful of their needs. That is why since early this year, IRAS has been helping businesses prepare for the GST rate change by conducting monthly live webinars, publishing e-tax guides and FAQs on its website, as well as launching a YouTube video. Businesses that require more clarifications on the transitional rules can approach IRAS for more assistance.",5,805,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00805
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked how offenders will be prosecuted differently under the new Missing Trader Fraud section 62C.,6,806,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00806
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Currently, perpetrators of Missing Trader Fraud can only be prosecuted under non-tax Acts like the Companies Act, but as I mentioned just now, these provisions may not be able to cater to the specificities of Missing Trader Fraud, which is a very complex tax crime.",7,807,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00807
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Therefore, section 62C addresses this by introducing a new two-tiered approach to prosecute offenders based on their level of culpability and through enhanced penalties. Providing for this under the GST Act will also empower IRAS to investigate and prosecute these offences more effectively.",8,808,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00808
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As Mr Louis Ng highlighted, there is a clear distinction in the penalties between tiers one and two. The distinction between tiers is based on the presence of criminal intent. Where a person knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that his participation is for a fraudulent purpose, he will be prosecuted under tier one, regardless of whether he has full oversight of the entire operation.",9,809,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00809
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Where there is no such criminal intent, and yet a person's business entity is eventually used in a specified arrangement, he will face the lesser, strict liability charge under tier two. This will apply when business owners do not exercise the reasonable care and due diligence expected of them.",10,810,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00810
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Establishing criminal intent, like for all criminal offences, is a question of fact that will need to be proven in Court. The eventual sentencing of cases will be determined by the Courts.",11,811,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00811
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,IRAS has provided guidance on its website and through an e-tax guide on how businesses can avoid being drawn into a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement.

2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, let me move on to the questions on the GST rate increase itself. Members – from the speeches I have heard – broadly agreed that our structural needs are rising and we do need to raise the revenues to fund them. The key issues are how we go about doing so and these issues can be summarised into two broad questions.",14,814,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00814
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, why raise the GST now; and second, why not alternatives to the GST? Let me take them in turn.",15,815,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00815
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, why raise the GST now? I fully understand and appreciate Members' concerns about doing so in such a challenging economic environment. This was a very difficult decision for me and the MOF team. We had considered this very carefully, leading up to the Budget, as I explained in the Budget speech and in our Budget debate and subsequently, even after the Budget when we saw conditions deteriorating. But eventually, we decided that it was still necessary to move.",16,816,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00816
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For now, our economy and labour market are still holding steady. Our GDP growth is projected to come in at 3% to 4% this year. Our resident unemployment rate has also recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Sectors such as aviation and tourism that were badly affected by the pandemic are continuing to recover. There are some indications of weaker growth in some sectors and we are monitoring this closely.",17,817,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00817
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More importantly, the economic challenges we face are not just near-term or cyclical in nature. The ongoing war in Ukraine, disruptions to energy and food supplies as well as rising geopolitical tensions and more fragmented supply chains – these are the realities that we have to deal with not just in the near-term but very possibly for a more prolonged period.",18,818,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00818
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In other words, international economic conditions have fundamentally changed. While we expect inflationary pressures in Singapore to ease in the second half of next year, according to MAS' latest forecast, inflation rates are unlikely to go back to what they were over the past decade. Both globally and in Singapore, the ""new normal"" may well be a higher rate of inflation than what we were used to.",19,819,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00819
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is why where inflation is concerned, the Government has extended comprehensive support to Singaporeans, especially lower- and middle-income families, through three packages this year totalling more than $3.5 billion.",20,820,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00820
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On average, as I have explained, these measures will fully offset the inflation-driven increases in spending for lower-income and retiree households – fully offset the increase in spending for lower-income and retiree households due to inflation.",21,821,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00821
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the typical middle-income household, the Government support provided will offset more than half of the inflation-driven increases in cost of living this year.",22,822,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00822
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If you take the example of a middle-income family – which I think Mr Louis Chua highlighted just now in his speech – inflation is coming in at 6% this year, their annual expenditure will go up by – Mr Louis Chua estimated – around $2.700. Our estimates are not very different. So, yes, there is an increase in spending because of inflation, but the support they are getting this year is around $1,500. So, it will, again, keep to our commitment to offset more than half of the inflation-driven increase in cost of living this year for middle-income households. This does not take into account wage increases for individuals, which many of whom are very likely to enjoy.",23,823,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00823
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is what we are doing this year. Next year, we will continue to monitor closely the inflation situation and we will assess what additional support measures might be needed. At the same time, we will press ahead with our economic restructuring and transformation plans because when we make ourselves more productive and competitive, our workers will be able to earn more and this can more than make up for the higher prices and ensure that we are better off in real terms.",24,824,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00824
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked if the GST rate increase is the right macroeconomic stance to adopt in the face of higher inflation and a slowing economy.,25,825,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00825
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, in calendar year 2023, the additional GST support going to households is expected to be comparable to the additional GST revenue we receive. We have designed our assistance packages to start flowing support early, ahead of the GST rate increase.",26,826,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00826
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As a result, the combined impact of the GST increase and the offset schemes we have put in place is broadly fiscally neutral. Furthermore, we are targeting our support at the lower- to middle-income households rather than doing it in a broad-based manner. This will minimise any additional inflationary pressures.",27,827,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00827
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In sum, we have designed the overall package to ensure we neither stoke inflation inadvertently nor choke aggregate demand. This is an appropriate macroeconomic stance to adopt at this juncture.",28,828,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00828
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim cited what happened in Japan when they increased the GST rate as a warning of what might happen. But surely as a professional economist, Assoc Prof Lim must know better. Context matters. Japan was in a low inflation environment. They raised GST and their inflation doubled, yes, but from a chronically low 1% to 2% and, even then, temporarily. So, let us avoid raising these alarmist examples that may not be so relevant to our context.",29,829,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00829
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Does that mean there is nothing to learn from overseas? No, we must continue to learn from countries' experience, but let us make sure we get the right lessons.",30,830,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00830
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, there are no end of international examples, including recent ones, where governments have weakened their foundations of their fiscal systems and they have ended up paying a very major price. So, let us never, ever be tempted to go down that route.",31,831,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00831
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"While there are considerable uncertainties in the economic outlook, there is certainly nothing uncertain about Government expenditures, especially in the area of healthcare, which many Members have cited, including Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Sharael Taha and Ms Joan Pereira.",32,832,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00832
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Our population is ageing with every passing year. Government support and spending on healthcare has been rising over the past decade, tripling from $3.7 billion in FY2010 to $11.3 billion in FY2019. Since then, we have continued to age, and our healthcare needs have become only more acute. I have said this before, we expect the Government's healthcare spending to go up, from 2.2% of GDP to 3.5% of GDP. That is 1.3 percentage points of GDP, much more than the revenues we get from the GST increase.",33,833,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00833
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And this is on healthcare alone. So, even as we deal with healthcare spending, we have to resource many other spending needs. For example, we want to invest more in early childhood education, to give every child the best start in life. Annual spending there is expected to double to over $2 billion in the next few years.",34,834,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00834
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We also want to do more to uplift our lower-wage workers. Surely, there is unanimous agreement in this House to do more here. Mr Desmond Choo and Ms Yeo Wan Ling spoke passionately about this, and I assure them this is also a key priority for the Government. This is why I had announced in the Budget that we will be spending over $9 billion over the next five years, on the enhanced Workfare and the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, and I announced further enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme earlier this year. We will continue to closely monitor the progress of our efforts to uplift the wages of lower-wage workers and we stand ready to do more if needed.",35,835,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00835
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Ms Yeo Wan Ling also highlighted concerns about SMEs and self-employed persons and we are also looking at how we can do more to help them.,36,836,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00836
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Today, public housing is a key concern for many and we are ramping up our BTO supply to ensure accessibility and affordability of public housing and to address the backlogs due to COVID-19 amid higher construction costs, and all that will, again, cost more.",37,837,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00837
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We also need to spend more to strengthen our social compact. This is an exercise we are undertaking now through the Forward Singapore conversations, and we are considering further policy shifts to do more for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. These moves will certainly require additional resources.",38,838,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00838
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, healthcare already, you can see where the spending needs are going to be, it is very clear, because of the ageing population. Then, you add up all of these other needs. It is a few billion here and a few billion there – they all add up. None of these needs have become less urgent because of the global economic situation. On the contrary, we must do more, especially in an uncertain and volatile environment.",39,839,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00839
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If we do not deal with this huge spending gap now and decisively, the problem will only snowball and very soon we will ourselves be unable to fund programmes that Singaporeans need.",40,840,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00840
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is why, having considered this so carefully before the Budget and after the Budget, even in the last few months when the global economic environment had deteriorated, we felt that there was no possibility for us to delay the GST increase any further.",41,841,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00841
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But what we can and what we will do is to delay the impact of the GST increase. That is done through the Assurance Package for the majority of Singaporean households for at least five years. In the meantime, as Members noted, we can then start to benefit from the recovery in tourism and collect more GST from tourists, foreigners and those who are better-off. That is the reason why we are doing it like that, because people say, forget your Assurance Package. I do not do the Assurance Package, do not do GST, we square off and we will just do GST later. But do not forget, when we do it the way we have designed, revenues start flowing in. From who? From foreigners, from the better off people, from tourists. So, we are already getting benefits from revenue sources from these groups through the way we have designed the system.",42,842,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00842
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked whether we would proceed with the second step of the GST rate increase if there were a sharp deterioration in the economic conditions next year, like a major global downturn. If indeed such downside risks were to materialise and our economy is severely impacted, we will need to take a careful review and we will consider whether to proceed with the second step of the increase in 2024.",43,843,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00843
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For now, this is not our baseline expectation. Barring a severe downturn in global economic circumstances, we will proceed with the second step of the increase to put our public finances on a much stronger footing and we will ensure that households are well-supported through the transition.",44,844,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00844
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, let me talk on the second set of questions around why not consider alternatives to the GST? Here, several alternatives were offered. Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim and Mr Louis Chua suggested that there was fiscal surplus or fiscal slack, which would enable us to delay the GST. I wish that were so. I wish that were so, but unfortunately, we do not have any surplus.",45,845,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00845
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim said that the Government is shielded from inflation because when inflation goes up and prices are higher, we will automatically collect more revenues in nominal terms. He is right. But do not forget, and he did not mention this, Government spending must also go up correspondingly. Public servant salaries must go up surely. Are we going to deny them wage increases?",46,846,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00846
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Support schemes must go up surely, to keep pace with inflation. So, on both sides, yes, we may collect more in nominal terms, but we will also have to spend more. In FY2021, we did enjoy higher than expected revenue and we had a surplus of $1.9 billion in FY2021. But we have already used this surplus, as well as the better-than-expected fiscal outturn for the first half of FY2022 to fund the June and October support packages this year.",47,847,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00847
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At this stage, it is still too early to determine the eventual fiscal outturn for the second half of FY2022. But for now, we are not expecting a surplus for the year and we will provide a firmer update, of course, at next year's Budget. But the bottom line is, any surpluses that you can think of are imaginary. They are not there and will not allow us to delay the GST.",48,848,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00848
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second set of suggestions of alternatives are largely to use more from the past reserves. And there, you have different variants, including tweaking the formula for NIRC from 50% to 60% or changing the definition of land sales revenues so that all the revenue from land sold attributable to the first 10 years of lease goes into current reserves as opposed to past reserves.",49,849,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00849
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Basically, whichever the suggestion, the point is, these suggestions are asking the Government to use more from the past reserves. That is what it comes down to. The Workers' Party have said that what they are suggesting is not to raid the past reserves, but it is really just to slow down the accumulation in reserves. It sounds very attractive, but it essentially means that we are leaving our next generation with fewer resources.",50,850,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00850
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This will just make it harder for them to meet future needs at a time when things are going to be more challenging, as Ms Foo Mee Har and many others have highlighted. At a time when our economy will be maturing, our population will be ageing rapidly and the uncertainties in the world are only becoming greater and greater. Surely, this cannot be the responsible thing to do.",51,851,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00851
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, let us not succumb to the temptation of taking this easy way out and making things worse for our children and grandchildren. In any case, as Mr Derrick Goh has highlighted, the growth of the reserves is already expected to slow, given the significant headwinds in the global investment environment, long-term structural changes that we can see happening in the world, including the rise in geopolitical tensions, climate change, ageing populations, lower productivity growth. All this will affect future long-term returns. Geopolitical tensions, in particular, might not only reduce investment returns but could even result in conflict or war, which can impact the value of our investments.",52,852,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00852
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Derrick Goh had asked about the process to determine the long-term expected real rate of return, given these structural trends, and I assure him that we have a robust process in place. Basically, before the start of each financial year, the investment entities – MAS, GIC and Temasek – will calculate the expected long-term real rate of return for the assets they each manage. This has to be certified by their respective boards and then they will submit it to the Government. The Government would take these inputs to propose the overall long-term expected real rate of return to the President. The President will consult with the Council of Presidential Advisors before deciding whether to agree with the Government's proposal. So, it is a very robust system with a few layers of checks in place.",53,853,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00853
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Given the trends that we expect over the coming years, it may well be that the expected long-term returns will have to come down – just based on these professional inputs and the assessment of these structural challenges we face. And if so, the right approach and certainly the approach that the Government will take, is to accept the lower NIRC and either adjust our spending accordingly or we will have to find other forms of revenue.",54,854,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00854
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, that is the second broad range of suggestions – to use more from the past reserves. I heard just now from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, the third area of suggestion which is to fine-tune the GST system to have exemptions for essentials. That is something that Ms He Ting Ru had suggested during the Budget debate as well and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has reiterated that proposal.",55,855,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00855
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is, again, one of those things that sounds like a wonderful idea.",56,856,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00856
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But the road to perdition is paved with many good intentions. And this is not just from our analysis. You look around the world, multi-tier GST systems have lots of problems, huge difficulties trying to distinguish between the products. The system is so costly, it is onerous to implement and it becomes very, very cumbersome.",57,857,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00857
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is not talking in the abstract. More recently, I saw a BBC article about the Indian system. Pizza toppings are now deemed not to be classified as cheese. Why? A fifth of the toppings are made by vegetable oil and vegetable oil is not considered cheese. So, they charge GST at a higher rate of 18% for what they deem as ""edible preparations"" rather than at 12%, which is the rate for cheese. And this had to go through the Courts and it was determined by the Courts.",58,858,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00858
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"No end to this sort of challenges. That is what we have seen everywhere and the bigger problem behind this is just that besides the administration, the cumbersomeness, the complication, it is just not effective. It sounds good on paper but it is not effective because when you exempt a basket of goods like essential items, in the end, you benefit the well-to-do because the well-to-do will spend more on everything, not just luxury items, but basic necessities as well. And this is a conclusion not just made by us. It is a conclusion reached by studies, based on studies by numerous governments as well as organisations like the OECD. So, we have more than enough evidence to show that this multi-tier system does not work effectively.",59,859,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00859
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, according to the BBC report I read, 80% of countries which introduced GST after 1995, have opted for a single-rate system – like us, for good reason.",60,860,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00860
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, let us not try to come up with ideas that sound good on paper, sound attractive, but in the end, we know, not just because we do not like the idea, not just because we are not open to new ideas, but we know from independent analyses done by other countries, done by the OECD, that these ideas, these alternatives, do not work. They are not effective.",61,861,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00861
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, we have designed a different system in Singapore, which is, as I described in my first speech just now, also multi-tier, but it is multi-tiered by income and it is a far more effective system.",62,862,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00862
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim said it was a patchwork of offsets. Well, I think he does not give Singapore enough credit. If you look around the world at any GST system, I dare say we are one of the few, if not the only country with such an effective system of GST that has taxed consumption fairly and effectively. Certainly, not a patchwork, but a thorough, deliberate design of the GST system to make it fair and effective.",63,863,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00863
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The fourth idea to why not alternatives to GST is, let us look at other revenue alternatives. Whether it is property tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax. Look at sin taxes. Let us look at all these other revenue alternatives.",64,864,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00864
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, we have been through these arguments. We went through them in great detail at the Budget debate. I will go through them again.",65,865,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00865
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The problem with these ideas, not because we are not open to them. We have considered all of them carefully and, in fact, in the Budget, we did raise property tax, we did raise personal income tax as well. But the problem with these ideas, as a substitute for the GST, is that simply the sums do not add up. Why?",66,866,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00866
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me explain. Again, if I may say. Property tax on residential property yields only $1 billion in annual revenue, today. How much more do you want to get from property tax? We have already raised it significantly this Budget for the high-end properties. You want to get more revenues from property tax, you will inevitably have to cover a wider group of property owners, including the middle-income.",67,867,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00867
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Personal income tax – we have raised it in the Budget but if you want to raise more – for example, as I mentioned in the Budget debate – if you want to load all of the GST revenue on personal income tax and push it only for the top marginal rates, the top marginal rates will go up from 22% to 42%. Why would the top earners stay in Singapore and pay 42% tax?",68,868,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00868
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, again, inevitably when you talk about personal income tax, any way to get more revenue, will inevitably mean higher rates for a broader group of income earners.",69,869,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00869
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Or corporate income tax for that matter. Yes, there is BEPS 2.0 which may yield more revenue, according to some estimates . But it is really too early to determine how much we will get from the changes in BEPS 2.0 because as I keep saying, there are two pillars in BEPS 2.0 – Pillar One, Pillar Two. Pillar One would definitely impact us. Pillar Two is where you talk about minimum corporate tax globally of 15%. We may get some revenue there, but we have to look at the combined effects of Pillars One and Two. And even after looking at all that, even if we do get additional revenues, the reality is that global competition for investments will only get more intense in this new environment.",70,870,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00870
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With geopolitical tensions going up, countries are talking about reshoring, friend-shoring, onshoring. What does that mean? ""Investments come back to my country."" And governments are offering very generous subsidies and grants to attract these investments back. Never mind BEPS 2.0 and corporate minimum tax rates of 15%. They are offering very attractive packages to attract these investments back to their home countries. Surely, our jobs and investments will be at risk if we are not able to keep pace and offer equally attractive value propositions in Singapore.",71,871,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00871
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, I have gone through these four different buckets of ideas  fiscal surpluses, use more from past reserves, zero-rating, multi-tiered GST, tap on other revenue alternatives. And I have explained why actually it is very hard to for any of them to replace the GST increase.",72,872,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00872
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, as I said just now, the GST revenues alone are not even enough to meet our healthcare funding gap – 1.3 percentage points of GDP is the gap by 2030 but our GST increase only yields 0.7% of GDP. This is healthcare alone. We have not talked about social spending. We have not talked about lower-wage workers, early childhood, all the other meritorious things we want to do.",73,873,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00873
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, really, the question is not GST or these other alternatives. But we need GST and other alternatives. That is why from MOF's point of view, we will continue to study all other fiscal options, all other revenue options and consider how best over time to ensure more resilient and more sustainable revenues for the future.",74,874,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00874
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Having explained my position and also gone through all these different alternative ideas, I should say one thing, which is, I also take issue with the way that Opposition Members and especially Members of the Workers' Party have characterised the Government's position.",75,875,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00875
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Essentially, they have painted a very simplistic narrative. That Government has not considered these alternatives, that we are on autopilot, we are not open to ideas, we are just stubbornly pushing away at something we decided to do anyway. But that is completely false. It is completely false because we have gone through this already in the Budget debate. I have explained repeatedly in the Budget debate that we had thought about all the options very carefully, explained why many of these alternatives are not substitutes for GST. I have gone through them again today. In fact, I have said it is not just GST or these alternatives. We have to consider so many different options together given our huge funding gap and I have also explained that we have studied this carefully before we made the decision, the very difficult decision to proceed, both in the Budget and after the Budget.",76,876,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00876
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, this false and simplistic narrative painted by the Workers' Party which, as Mr Murali Pillai has kindly reminded us, is not the first time. A pattern of repeating the same arguments against the GST, time and again. Really, it does not do justice to the commitment and professionalism of the entire team in MOF, including the public officials who are trying so hard to do what is right and to pursue a strategy of fiscal responsibility and discipline for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans.",77,877,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00877
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To be clear, the Workers' Party is entitled to your own position. By all means oppose the GST, adopt a different position. Fine. But at least be honest and responsible – acknowledge that your alternatives will either end up requiring the middle-income to pay more or will use more of the past reserves therefore, less for the next generation. And at least have the decency to acknowledge that the Government had considered all of these alternatives carefully. We debated them in the Budget – thoroughly and rigorously – before we decided on this move.",78,878,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00878
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would have thought that is what a responsible political party would have done. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed that the Workers' Party has chosen to take a different path. And I wonder if this is because they feel that this approach is the best way to advance their political agenda as they have been over the years – to paint the PAP Government as uncaring and out of touch.",79,879,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00879
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, we have gone through this debate in great detail, in the Budget debate and now, I can assure you this that in terms of the process, in terms of thinking about the alternatives, thinking about how best to meet our funding needs, we have left no stone unturned. We have looked at each and every option very carefully and we have decided this is the best way to manage the fiscal gap that we face and make sure that we continue to keep Singapore's fiscal foundation strong and resilient, especially for the future.",80,880,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00880

2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Foo Mee Har and Ms Joan Pereira suggested making it easier for people to understand our schemes and how they can benefit. Those who are not sure of their eligibility may refer to the GSTV website, as well as MOF’s website and the various press releases that we put out for more information. We will certainly continue to review to see how we can make information more easily accessible to Singaporeans.",83,883,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00883
2022-11-07-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I want to also assure Members that we keep a close eye on improving the administration of the GSTV scheme. Most eligible Singaporeans – about 98% of recipients – today get their cash payouts seamlessly through PayNow or direct bank crediting. Those who remain unbanked were previously paid via cheques which required encashment over bank counters, but we have since moved to using GovCash to make payments to these individuals and we expect the move to help reduce administrative costs and allow the unbanked to receive their payouts more quickly and conveniently.",84,884,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00884

So, it actively monitors and reviews all feedback on such cases.",85,885,2022-11-07-T-016-S-00885

2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"A consumption tax, yes, it is regressive if implemented as a standalone measure. But this is not how we have done it in Singapore. We have worked hard to design a system where GST is implemented together with permanent offsets through the GST Vouchers to negate that disproportionate impact on lower-income households. We have also taken great pains to make sure that the middle-income households are looked after so that they only pay slightly more GST, but the full impact of the GST, the full burden, is borne largely by high-income households as well as foreigners based here and tourists.",4,900,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00900
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is how we get the benefits of the GST system, which is a broad-based consumption tax without its drawbacks. What we have is a much, much better alternative than taking more from future generations or significantly raising property or personal income taxes on the broad middle class. It is, certainly, a more responsible approach than planning on the basis of revenues or surpluses that may not materialise.",5,901,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00901

Instead, we focus our efforts on designing effective policies to benefit all Singaporeans. This may mean that the policies are a little bit more complicated.

2022-11-07-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The first is with regard to this year's fiscal outturn. I think the Deputy Prime Minister shared that we do not have any surplus this year but, at the same time, it is too early to determine. But also, at the same time, whatever surplus we have is imaginary.",2,923,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00923
2022-11-07-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I recognise that I have limited information. But as I shared in my speech, just based on the first six months of the operating revenues that have been disclosed so far, we have a $5.8 billion increase in revenue, compared to the year before. So, even if we less off the $1.5 billion package in October and $1.4 billion announced today, would it be wrong to say that there is still some slack, at least based on what is disclosed so far?",3,924,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00924
2022-11-07-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Second, in terms of the NIRC contribution, is it wrong to say that increasing the NIRC contribution rate will not result in a decline in revenue? I think an example would be, as I shared in my Budget speech this year, where even if we put into context the drawdown of $43 billion in our reserves for the COVID-19 packages, our reserves today are still higher than they were five years ago.",4,925,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00925
2022-11-07-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Lastly, on GST exemption and all that, at this point in time, based on my understanding, there are already provisions of zero-rated GST for exports of goods and international services. At the same time, there are certain classes of goods and services that are exempted from GST, such as the sale of residential properties and the provision of financial services as well.",5,926,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00926
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, on the three questions, on the fiscal outturn, Mr Louis Chua only looked at the revenue side of the house. He has not looked at the spending side, which I mentioned just now.",1,927,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00927
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Yes, revenues have gone up in the first half of fiscal year 2022 but spending has gone up as well. As I said just now, overall, the surplus in FY2021 and the better-than-expected outturn – revenue, net of expenditure – in the first half of 2022 have already been fully utilised for the packages this year.",2,928,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00928
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"What happens in the second half of FY2022 is still to be seen. Yes, there may well be some buoyant revenue sources. We will see. But our spending is also going to be higher in the second half and, net-net overall, as I mentioned just now, we do not expect a surplus in FY2022 at the end of the financial year. But we will, at the end, in the Budget next year, give a firmer estimate, as we always do.",3,929,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00929
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On NIRC, I have also explained our position on NIRC. I have said that, going forward, we anticipate that NIRC, which contributes about 3.5% of GDP to our revenue today, we think that is likely, over the longer term, to keep pace with economic growth. NIRC will keep pace with economic growth, we think, but this has not taken into consideration the potential for our expected long-term real rate of return to be reduced because of all these structural challenges that we have just been talking about – climate change, ageing population, geopolitical tensions.",4,930,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00930

2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On GST exemption, yes, there are certain classes of items which are exempt or zero-rated today but they are done for very good reasons, including difficulties in collection and we have kept it to a very, very, very tiny group of items. Very small. Look around at all the GST systems in the world, I think ours, we have kept it very, very limited.",6,932,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00932
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"By and large, most items are taxed on a single-rate GST and if we were to expand the exemption of zero rate to many more items, for that matter, to essential items, food, then we are talking about a large expansion of exmempting of zero-rating in our GST system. All the complications, all the downsides, all the problems, all the ineffectiveness that we have seen in other countries will be experienced in Singapore, too.",7,933,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00933

2022-11-07-T-018,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"The Deputy Prime Minister reiterated that he and his MOF colleagues do not believe that it is possible to delay the hike. If I could just confirm my first question that the estimates of impending healthcare needs over the next two years are, in fact, so urgent that they cannot be delayed even for the short run such that, in the absence of the hike, the Government will inevitably find itself in a deficit.",2,936,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00936
2022-11-07-T-018,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"My second point is to clarify that I was not, in fact, being alarmist in my speech about potential inflationary consequences of the hike. In fact, I clearly explained that the Japanese environment was different but since the Deputy Prime Minister is so confident in his claim that there will not be an increase in inflation as a result, I wonder if the Government will, in fact, commit to a pause in GST increases to 9% if inflation does turn out to be higher than expected as a result of the hike.",3,937,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00937
2022-11-07-T-018,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Finally, the point about the multi-tiered system. I think the whole point was that we should use the current circumstances as a way to pilot the idea. I think we have never shied away from talking about how policies need to work for us. I wonder if he would agree that the postponement of GST on essential items actually affords us this opportunity to testbed this idea.",4,938,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00938
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, on delaying GST, say, for one or two years, we are doing much better than that. We are delaying for more than five years with the Assurance Package. So, I am not sure why I would want to delay only for one to two years because I can delay for much longer.",1,939,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00939
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And with the design of the scheme that we have done, as I have mentioned just now, delaying for the vast majority of Singaporeans but getting those who can pay to pay first. Is that not better? [Applause.]",2,940,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00940
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, on pausing the second step of GST increase, should there be much higher than expected inflation. I mentioned just now the circumstances under which we might reconsider the second step. And that is really in the event of a very significant change in the external environment, globally and then impacting Singapore. This has to do not just with inflation, but with the economy, with labour markets, for example, if we were to go into a deep recession next year. It is not in our baseline expectations at all, but who can tell in this uncertain world what can unfold?",3,941,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00941
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If something like that were to happen, then as I said just now, we will certainly take a pause to review, to take stock of the economic circumstances and consider our position for the second step.",4,942,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00942
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, on the multi-tier and the pilots. Do not get me wrong. It is not as though we are reluctant to take in new ideas and to consider pilot schemes. We always do and we are always open to experimentation and policy reviews, but on this particular case, it is not for lack of studies. There has been considerable amount of work done to look at the effectiveness of multi-tiered systems all over the world by governments, by independent organisations. We have looked at all of these studies. And when the studies are overwhelmingly negative, it ought to give us pause to consider, is it even necessary to pursue a pilot for Singapore's circumstances, or should we think of alternative solutions? And that is exactly what we have done. We have developed a different system in Singapore. Also, a multi-tiered system, but I dare say, a more effective multi-tiered system, because the GST is tiered by income and we ensure that we can tax consumption in a way that is fair and effective.",5,943,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00943

2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Allow me a little bit of preamble, just one minute. I think, however —",2,946,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00946

2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, two clarifications. But before that, let me say one thing, is that the basic differences between the position, at least for PSP and the Government, is that we think that the Government still did not appreciate enough the financial position that the Singaporeans are in. They are not just paying taxes, there are many kinds of indirect taxes. As a result, let me quote one thing —",1,948,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00948
2022-11-07-T-018,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, Mr Leong, please proceed to your clarifications. It is not an opportunity to repeat your speech again.",1,949,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00949
2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, I am coming to that. Let me quote one thing. Even when we talk about the NIRC, we are trying to fanthom up this whole money scheme, the fiscal system that the Government has on the people. So, let me just talk about the NIRC. Two questions to Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, please.",1,950,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00950
2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"One, what is the share of NIRC? We give 50% of the NIR to the Budget, right? So, NIRC is the 50%. But what is the share of NIRC that is not spent in the Budget year?",2,951,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00951
2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Two, there are operating expenditures in the Budget and recently we have discovered, you have HDB grants which cost the Budget money, deficit to the Budget, and this in turn, will eat into the NIRC that you contributed, right? So, I ask you the second question  did the NIRC contributed by the past land sales cover the deficit of the HDB grant?",3,952,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00952
2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Two questions, thank you.",4,953,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00953
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, there is no unspent NIRC because the Government does not run a surplus anymore. Maybe in the past but nowadays, what surplus are we talking about? We literally are running balanced Budgets, if not deficit Budgets, so there is no unspent revenue. Every revenue we collect, including through the NIRC, is spent.",1,954,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00954
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, on the HDB grant and Mr Leong Mun Wai says, ""We have just discovered"". I am not sure how he just discovered this. This has been going on for years since I was a young officer in MOF. We have always financed HDB on its deficit, it is called deficit financing, which means when HDB has a deficit because it has a shortfall, it has to sell the flats at a subsidised price, the selling price is less than the development cost, deficit. And therefore, there is a Government funding to HDB. This has always been the basis of our system, because we want to assure Singaporeans that they will always be able to afford HDB flats in Singapore.",2,955,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00955
2022-11-07-T-018,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,956,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00956
2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, thank you. I have expected the Deputy Prime Minister to answer like that. First, on the NIRC. There is a large share of the NIRC being apportioned to funds, right? Just like a few years back, you took $6 billion out of the NIRC and put it in the GST Voucher. So, that means, for that particular year, I think it was 2018, we do not have $6 billion benefit from NIRC. So, one would think that we have been discussing a lot today – would the Deputy Prime Minister commit that in the future, all NIRC will be spent in the current year?",1,957,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00957
2022-11-07-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, on the HDB grant, you did not answer my question. I asked, the HDB grant, like this year, the grant may be close to $4.5 billion, $4.8 billion to cover the deficit of the HDB. So, the amount of NIRC will be reduced by that amount, right? Because you have to pay for the HDB grant. And besides that, there are other expenditures, which two of them I have mentioned in my last Adjournment Motion speech. So, can you answer the question, please?",2,958,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00958
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, I have already answered the question on the second point. The basic point is all Government sources of funding, whether from NIRC or from revenue, come into a consolidated fund. We do not hypothecate, which is something that Mr Leong is saying – identify this revenue source, link to this particular spending item. That is not what we do in Singapore. All the revenue sources come in; because monies are fungible, this is a general pot of funding. And then, we spend according to our priorities and therefore there is no point going through and identifying these sorts of linkages.",1,959,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00959
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the first point of whether or not there will be unspent funding, it is the same point. Generally, we do not believe that there will be surpluses, because we are running such a tight ship now, these days. But should it happen, for example, that we have an unexpected windfall, a good year, maybe because of property sentiments, cyclical reasons why revenue has some upside, can it happen? Maybe, from time to time, it can happen. Then, what is the right response for us to do? Well, if there is that surplus, we might very well consider whether there are longer-term needs in the future that would be prudent for us to set aside some of that surplus into these so-called funds.",2,960,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00960
2022-11-07-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, climate change adaptation. We have set aside, I think, $5 billion. Do you think we would only need $5 billion for climate change adaptation? To build sea walls and all? Of course not. So, in a good year, for example, if we have that extra money, we will look at longer-term needs and we will set aside these funds prudently, as we have always done to manage our fiscal and finances in a responsible manner.",3,961,2022-11-07-T-018-S-00961

2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I just have a few points of clarification and firstly, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his replies and to respond to the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai, I think there are points of agreement between the PAP and the Workers' Party in this debate.",1,966,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00966
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"We are not advocating going to debt markets, for example, to finance a deficit, to make the constitutional changes necessary to do that, we are not advocating that. So, there are points of agreement, but I think the disagreement is philosophic and it has to do principally, I think, with the slope of the reserves growth and we advocate for certain measures that would slow the slope of the reserves growth and PAP disagrees with that. We may have to agree to disagree.",2,967,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00967
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"But my clarification is really on whether the Deputy Prime Minister would acknowledge that as countries evolve, societies evolve, and also as the size, the absolute size of the financial reserves increase, different policies, are necessary and advisable, compared to when the reserves was $100 billion versus what it is now.",3,968,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00968
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"And on this point, in this context, I would like to bring Members back to the point my colleague, Mr Louis Chua, made that in the crisis of a generation, during COVID-19, many Members of this House, used the term ""the crisis of our generation"", ""the crisis of our generation"", we drew down about $50 billion. How large is that as a proportion of the reserves, I am not asking that as a question, I know the Government's position on that. But by most estimates that have been in circulation, it is a very, very small fraction. So, it begs the question, how much is enough? And we are at this stage as a society. When we are at this level, this quantitative level of financial reserves. And given that it was 15 years since the framework was last revised, does the Minister and the Government not acknowledge that it behooves us to work on these options at this point in time? So that is my first point of clarification.",4,969,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00969
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My second point of clarification is I wonder if the Deputy Prime Minister underestimates the risk of inflation specifically regards to this point. When the GST hike comes into effect in January next year, we have all acknowledged that may be an issue of some merchants using that as an excuse to increase prices more than necessary, and this is common everywhere in the world. We have a Committee Against Profiteering, but I think we should also acknowledge it is very difficult for any Committee in a time when inflation is running at very high levels to sort of effectively address and disentangle legitimate price hikes from profiteering-related price hikes. And in fact, many members of the public may not even raise feedback to the Committee because they may think that if certain prices by certain merchants are going up, well, that is just because of inflation, it is not because of profiteering.",5,970,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00970
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"So, from a point of view of practical execution, will the Deputy Prime Minister agree that it is very difficult to clamp down on this potential for profiteering and therefore, there is a macroeconomic inflation risk from introducing GST in the calendar year next year. I take the Deputy Prime Minister's point that fiscally it is neutral but there is this other risk of macroeconomic inflation.",6,971,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00971
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,And my last point of clarification —,7,972,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00972
2022-11-07-T-020,Speaker,Mr Speaker,If you can keep the third clarification shorter than the first two.,1,973,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00973
2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Yes, it is very short. I did not hear the  Deputy Prime Minister",1,974,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00974
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, let me take these three questions in turn.",1,975,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00975
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, Mr Leon Perera says there is a disagreement with philosophy and the main disagreement is on the slope of the growth in reserves. I would say the main disagreement is this  the Workers' Party basically wants to use more past reserves and leave behind less for our children and grandchildren – just state it honestly. There is no need to have fancy words. ""Slow down the rate of growth of reserves"". Basically, you are asking to use more of the past reserves and leaving behind less for the next generation. Fine, that is a legitimate position to have, but is this a wise thing to do? Is it a responsible thing to do, considering the new global environment that we are in, the uncertainties that we face, all the challenges that many Members here have spoken about. Is it wise to do it this way?",2,976,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00976
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And if you think about it, if our forefathers had taken that same approach, I said in my Budget speech or in my round-up speech during the debate, if our forefathers had thought exactly the same line of thought, take 20% more of NIRC for themselves, today, we will be not just talking about a 9% GST, we will be talking about an 11% GST.",3,977,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00977
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, if we were to do the same, then the next generation – because fiscal needs will continue to grow – they will have to face a greater tax burden, not to mention having fewer resources to cope with crisis, emergencies or anything that can emerge in this uncertain world. And not to mention that we have not even talked about the more than $50 billion which we have drawn from past reserves so far, for which we are very unlikely for now, to be able to pay back. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance"", Official Report, 7 November 2022, Vol 95, Issue No 73, Correction by Written Statement section.]",4,978,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00978
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"How can one tell whether or not in the coming years there will not be similar emergencies, pandemics, crises for which we may very well legitimately have to go to the President and ask for permission to use the past reserves.",5,979,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00979
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, in light of all of these considerations, I would say, the Government's position is very much to say today's system, do not change the parameters now. If we need revenues, we find revenues in other ways that we can do, whether through the GST increase or through other revenue raising sources.",6,980,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00980
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second point I would say is in fact, the disagreement on philosophy, is not just on reserves. Because as Mr Murali Pillai has highlighted, WP has consistently, time and again, throughout Singapore's history, basically, opposed the GST increase.",7,981,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00981
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, it is not just a philosophical matter about the reserves. It is also a philosophical matter about the GST. You fundamentally oppose the GST increase, for whatever reasons, I cannot quite fathom, because the way that we have designed the GST in Singapore is very different. I have explained this repeatedly, it does not hurt the poor, it is fair, it is effective, it is a unique system. And yet, WP continues to oppose GST and the GST increase. And that is why I surmise, the only reason you might do so, is because of a political reason, because you know this is unpopular, and therefore, it serves your political interests to oppose GST.",8,982,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00982
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, on the macro inflation risk and the practicalities on tackling profiteering, this is not something we talk about in theory, because we have had experience doing this, through repeated rounds of doing GST increases in previous years. And the Committee Against Profiteering, each time we stand it up, has proven to be effective, has proven to be able to effectively deter any businesses from profiteering and when we catch someone, we have been able to take very quick action.",9,983,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00983
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, we have confidence in doing these sorts of things, not because of theory, but because of practical experience gained from past rounds of GST increases.",10,984,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00984

2022-11-07-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,I would just like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he could respond to my third clarification on healthcare expenses and the urgency of introducing GST to meet healthcare expenditure in the next few years.,1,986,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00986
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I forgot to talk about healthcare. I have already talked about the projections for healthcare in 2010. That is a projection that we are able to make on account of our ageing population. [,1,987,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00987
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Because, remember, the elderly on a per capita spend basis incurs more healthcare spending than the young. Most of our healthcare spending is incurred when we get older, not when we are young.",2,988,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00988
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Just the simple mathematics of it, as our population pyramid shifts to an older population, on that simple mathematics, healthcare spending must surely go up. That is why, we have good basis and good confidence to project in the longer term, where the trends are. The only way in which we can avoid that, is somehow magically, we have older folks spending less on healthcare. I do not know how that might even happen. I hope Healthier SG will pay some dividends but let us be realistic. Even if it helps to slow things down, I think the fact that older folks will incur more healthcare spending, I think that is not going to go away. So, the trend is very clear. The upslope is very clear.",3,989,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00989
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The only other way to address this again, is, again, if we are honest, let us not spend so much for the elderly. And I am sure, no one in this House wants to take such a position. That structural increase is very clear, but on a year-to-year basis, next year, two years' time, how much more will healthcare spending go up, it is not so clear. Because there will be some lumpy investments, there may be a new hospital here; maybe for pandemic reasons, we need to enhance our infection controls.",4,990,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00990
2022-11-07-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, these are nearer-term projections which may be slightly lumpy, a little bit more unpredictable. But the broader trend of increase is very clear and we have start preparing now for that increase.",5,991,2022-11-07-T-020-S-00991

2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Sir, the ability to attract global talent is particularly important for an advanced economy like Singapore where we have more jobs than the number of local workers and senior corporate and skilled roles to be filled in our diverse sectors. While many countries have also embarked on a drive to attract global talent, others have turned increasingly inward and there are indications that such sentiments are growing in Singapore. This is natural, because at its basic, global talent policies are about allowing people into our home. It is therefore not only a practical matter but also an emotive one. As such, a winning global talent strategy must rely not only on facts and figures; it must also build comfort and give assurances to our local Singaporeans.",1,1009,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01009
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Global talent policies look at attracting and retaining global talent in Singapore that is complementary to our local workforce. But a global talent strategy is far more complex because it must take into consideration many other areas that are intrinsically intertwined, including education, upskilling and reskilling, national identity and culture, economic development and competitiveness, entrepreneurship, research, housing, law enforcement amongst others.",2,1010,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01010
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Over the past few months, the hon Minister for Manpower has, in great detail and quite painstakingly set out how the various global talent schemes work, including new schemes like OnePass and COMPASS. He has also explained the rationale for adjustments that have been made to existing schemes. And I am in agreement with the Minister that these are steps in the right direction. In fact, today, the Minister and I have also agreed on the colour scheme for our outfit, and it is purely incidental, Mr Speaker.",3,1011,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01011
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"These programmes have, in part, led to Singapore being consistently recognised as one of the top countries in the world for global talent to consider moving to. Just last week, INSEAD and the Portulans Institute ranked Singapore second in their Global Talent Attractiveness Index. This Index recognises not only a country’s ability to bring in global talent, but also how well it develops its local talent. So, overall, we are recognised internationally as doing very well and we can take heart that our global talent policies are generally sound.",4,1012,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01012

The initial impetus should not be about immigration bolstering our population numbers or immediately settling in as residents. The first impetus is to fill gaps in our economy.",9,1017,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01017
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"This transactional first instance will be a testing phase, to see if they like us and we like them. If it is a match, then we should certainly invite them to become Permanent Residents and citizens. This is because as much as we say that we are ourselves a nation of immigrants, over our decades of independence, we have formed an identity of our own and become a proud nation and a proud people. Hence, we must ensure that foreigners seeking to settle here respect and accept our national identity, shared values and our way of life. This testing phase could occur both while an expatriate is in Singapore on a work pass or during permanent residency.",10,1018,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01018
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"I note that the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority already considers as criteria for Citizenship or Permanent Residency, an applicant’s “family ties to Singapore”, their “ability to contribute to Singapore and integrate into our society” and their “commitment to sinking roots in Singapore”. If this meeting of minds and hearts are amongst the chief considerations and criteria for residency and citizenship, it will ameliorate the concerns of Singaporeans that naturalised citizens and permanent residents are going to be foreign from us, or even worse, that they will all be fabulously rich, beyond our understanding, and more ""atas"" than us. It will also render irrelevant any distinction sought to be made between Singapore-born Singaporeans and naturalised Singaporeans – a distinction some quarters have sought to make.",11,1019,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01019
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"My view is that emphasising a transactional initial relationship with global talent will not affect Singapore’s attractiveness as a magnet for global talent. In Dubai, for example, it is near impossible to become a citizen and yet, it has not had any trouble attracting a cosmopolitan pool of global talent to set up shop there, with many staying for the long term. Changes were made to their citizenship rules last year, but the criteria remain extremely stringent and even under the new rules, citizenship will only be offered to a very exceptional few.",12,1020,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01020
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Immigration and our global talent policy, although related, should not be seen as one and the same. I therefore encourage the government to emphasise that citizenship and to a certain extent, permanent residency is not merely a matter of skills and qualifications, but also one of fit and acceptance. This could be done by, for example, elaborating on how ICA assesses the criteria of whether a person would be able integrate into our society or whether they are ready to set roots down in Singapore.",13,1021,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01021

2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"I now come to my next point, Sir, on respect. Whether on a work pass or a permanent resident, global talent coming to Singapore are our guests and we, as Singaporeans, are their hosts. As much as we are hospitable and welcoming, it is also perfectly reasonable to expect that our global talents here respect their hosts. I suggest three key “respects” that global talent should keep in mind when coming here.",15,1023,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01023
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The first ""respect"" is respecting our laws and regulations. Singaporeans get particularly inflamed when we see incidents of foreigners flouting laws. This is because we, as a people, are famously law abiding and we expect others to be the same in our country. A case in point was the public furore that arose over foreigners gathering outside bars and restaurants in May 2020, which was during the circuit breaker when such gatherings were disallowed.",16,1024,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01024

These flashpoints often lead to a backlash against our global talent policies. Tellingly, in relation to this particular incident, MOM had to respond to queries related to work passes, saying in a statement, that ""foreigners working in Singapore must abide by our laws and that those convicted, regardless of the type of work pass they hold risk having them revoked and banned from working in Singapore"".",17,1025,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01025
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The second ""respect"" is respect for our culture, sensitivities and ways of doing things. Expatriates in Singapore should seek, as far as possible, to learn how we do things and to adapt. This is one of the aims of the National Integration Council (NIC). I have looked at some of the resources provided by the NIC on its website and there are many suggestions as to how Singaporeans can reach out to expatriates and make them feel comfortable here. But it is a two-way process. Expatriates must also abide by our ways of doing things. These may be small things like respecting personal space or simple courtesies which are the norms here but may not be expected behaviour in their home countries.",18,1026,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01026

We need to make it a culture to consider locals first, in particular, for expats coming in who are in decision making or influential roles affecting hiring. We expend massive resources to educate, train, retrain our people and we have become one of the most highly skilled workforces in the world.

As I mentioned earlier, we should look to adopt an initial transactional approach to global talents coming in to fill jobs. In the midst of this, some Singaporeans will lose jobs to foreigners. But what our policies must ensure is that over time, foreigners will lose jobs to Singaporeans, as we become able to fill these roles ourselves, including by know-how and skills being transferred to us from our expat colleagues. Our foreign workforce must shift and it must mould itself around us. And this is what I believe is MOM’s new schemes and adjustments will be able to achieve.",23,1031,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01031

2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"As Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said at the Singapore Economic Policy Forum last month, thinking that we can get simply just get rid of foreigners to “reclaim” jobs for Singaporeans is flawed because these jobs may not automatically go to Singaporeans – they may go overseas, to countries with larger pools of talent. This replacement will instead, be dynamic and will be aided precisely by COMPASS, the FCF and dependency ratios.",25,1033,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01033

2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"This replacement is, however, also dependent on us grooming our local talent to themselves become global talent. It is not being a foreigner that makes one a global talent, it is the fact that these people have worked in other countries, some in many other countries and that they have international experience and networks. Such exposure is invaluable and in order for our local talent to become global talent, we must encourage the acquisition of precisely this quality.",27,1035,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01035
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Our local Universities are recognised as some of the very best in the world and this has led to some comments that since we have the best universities, why do we need global talent to come into Singapore. It is naïve to believe that one can graduate from our local University, work locally and then be able to take up top spots in MNCs. In Singapore, if one does not have international exposure, it will be increasingly difficult to compete for these top spots. As a global hub, we attract multinational corporations that look at the world as its talent pool because they want to get in the global best.",28,1036,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01036
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"My suggestion is that we need to do more not only at the universities but even at the Secondary level to encourage a global mindset amongst our local students who are our future workers. This should not only be in our school curricula or in the form of exchanges with other schools, but also through attachments with global companies and their laboratories, factories and facilities overseas or even in Singapore. In particular, we need to build a strong group of future workers who are well-acquainted and well-connected with Southeast Asia and APAC. This is especially important because of the growing number of corporate regional headquarters being set up in Singapore. The Singapore worker must see herself as a global worker – either working overseas for a time or travelling for work if based in Singapore.",29,1037,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01037

Kabam builds next generation robotic and connectivity solutions for built-environment businesses. Despite being a pandemic baby, has seen rapid growth over its two years of operations, partnering and providing services to, amongst others, Certis, the Singapore Land Authority, Singapore Technologies and Konica Minolta. Michael acts as the CEO of Kabam and his co-founders Kelvin Wee and Benjamin Chia credit him, with his prior experience in bomb disposal, subsea vehicles and logistics robotics, with the company’s rapid growth. Kabam employs 30 Singaporeans and they have shared with me that they had to shore up their technical team with some foreigners because the talent pool in robotics in Singapore is limited, but that they were working, through extensive partnerships with our IHLs to build up the expertise of their Singaporean Core.",32,1040,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01040

The criteria they apply to whom they seek to hire must also be very strict, to ensure that they thoroughly consider local applicants before looking at foreign candidates. Again, control mechanisms like the salary stipulations for each type of pass, dependency ratios, the FCF and COMPASS, will operate to as far as possible, make sure that locals are considered first in SMEs before foreign talent may be admitted.",33,1041,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01041
2022-11-07-T-022,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Sir, to conclude, my take on the restiveness surrounding our global talent policy is that is it borne not out of Singaporeans’ fear of competition, but out of thinking that we are subject to unfair competition. In fact, if we look at the various policies that govern how we approach global talent, it is quite clear that the criteria for a foreigner to come to work in Singapore is very stringent and that the system is heavily weighted towards Singaporeans. In fact, as much as there has been suggestions that foreigners are taking jobs from Singaporeans, many local businesses have asked instead that the regime be loosened to make it easier for skilled foreigners to come into Singapore.",34,1042,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01042

2022-11-07-T-022,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"First, on integrating work pass holders. As the Member has shared, we maintain a clear distinction between our work pass and immigration framework. Applications for Permanent Residency (PR) or Citizenship are assessed independently, and they are based on considerations, including the applicant's family ties to Singapore, their ability to integrate into our society, their economic contributions and commitment to sinking roots in Singapore.",8,1057,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01057

While we do not provide any guarantee or fast tracks to PR for our EP and ONE Pass holders, we hope that, as they spend time in Singapore, top talent will choose to make Singapore their home. Granting PR or Citizenship to deserving global talent means that we can anchor them here to continue creating opportunities for Singapore and Singaporeans in the long run.",9,1058,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01058
2022-11-07-T-022,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"There are clear benefits if work pass holders are well-integrated into Singapore's society.

We want to seek to strike a balance between promoting integration and not being overly prescriptive in how we achieve this aim. Employers also have an important part to play in supporting foreign employees who are new to Singapore. For instance, DBS Bank launched their own Singapore Immersion Programme. It assigns all new employees a Singaporean buddy and it organises activities, such as sharing sessions on Singapore's nation-building journey and walking trails exploring our multi-cultural heritage.",13,1062,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01062

We provide the necessary tools, at every step of the way, for locals to strengthen their own capabilities – we invest in education, from preschool to tertiary education; we have programmes that locals can tap on to upskill, reskill and make career transitions; and we provide financial support for those who may have been hurt or hit by curve balls in life.",15,1064,2022-11-07-T-022-S-01064

2022-11-07-T-022,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Second, developing a global mindset amongst our future workers. As the Member has shared, gaining overseas exposure is key to taking up leadership positions later, especially in global companies. We have programmes to start such capability building early.

2022-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB car parks are not common property and, therefore, do not come under the management and maintenance of Town Councils (TCs). However, the Town Councils Act allows TCs to manage and maintain HDB car parks on terms and conditions mutually agreed between HDB and TCs. In this regard, HDB offers TCs the option to serve as the maintenance agent for HDB car parks, as there may be operational synergies in TCs doing so. For instance, TCs can, potentially, obtain lower prices from calling bulk tenders for maintenance services. TCs can also better coordinate the scheduling of maintenance works to minimise disruption to residents.",1,1142,2022-11-07-T-032-S-01142
2022-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB ensures that the fees are fairly set in a number of ways. In determining the maintenance fees, HDB considers both TCs’ submissions of their operating costs for maintenance of car park equipment, such as pumps and fire protection systems, as well as the equivalent private sector rates to ensure that TCs are compensated fairly relative to market prices. It then adds an agency fee to TCs. The maintenance agreement period is, typically, three years. So, this allows for regular review of the fees. In addition, TCs can assess and decide if they wish to serve as HDB’s maintenance agent. Should TCs decline the offer to maintain HDB’s car parks, HDB will procure alternative maintenance services via tender.",2,1143,2022-11-07-T-032-S-01143

HDB carries out regular flat inspections to ensure that the occupancy cap is adhered to, and investigates public feedback received on suspected cases where the cap has been exceeded. Besides operating a dedicated hotline for the public to report suspected infringements, HDB also organises community programmes and publicises cases of action taken against flat owners to deter flat owners from breaching the rental rules. Depending on the severity and circumstances of the infringement, HDB may issue a written warning, impose a financial penalty of up to $50,000 or acquire the flats compulsorily from the owners.",2,1146,2022-11-07-T-033-S-01146

2022-11-07-T-035,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider funding or implementing noise mitigation measures to address the problem of noise generated by persons using amenities, such as basketball courts, playgrounds and fitness corners, that are in close proximity with residential flats outside the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme cycles.",1,1151,2022-11-07-T-035-S-01151

2022-11-07-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the design and provision of precinct amenities, HDB takes proactive design measures to minimise noise disturbances, for example, by locating playgrounds and fitness courts away from residential units. If Town Councils (TCs) face localised noise issues arising from the use of common spaces and facilities under their management, TCs can also implement measures to encourage considerate behaviour, such as switching off the lights in the shared facilities during rest hours and putting up advisory notices.",2,1153,2022-11-07-T-035-S-01153
2022-11-07-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB will continue to explore practical solutions to mitigate noise. However, it will not be useful to site such common facilities too far from residential blocks, which may make them inaccessible. Therefore, it is important for residents to be considerate towards their neighbours, such as by keeping the noise level down when going about their daily activities, especially during quiet hours, so as to provide a harmonious living environment for all. The Community Advisory Panel on Neighbourhood Noise will be recommending a set of community norms that residents should adopt to better manage neighbourhood noise by the end of the year.",3,1154,2022-11-07-T-035-S-01154

2022-11-07-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We expect the global economic environment to remain challenging in the year ahead. Growth in advanced economies, such as the US and Eurozone, is projected to slow due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, and as central banks intensify their synchronised tightening of monetary policy to curb rising inflation globally. Meanwhile, China continues to grapple with domestic COVID-19 outbreaks and a property market downturn. As the US, Eurozone and China are key trading partners to many countries around the world, a slowdown in these economies will have a negative impact on the global economy.",1,1156,2022-11-07-T-036-S-01156
2022-11-07-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As a small and open economy, Singapore will be affected by the economic slowdown in the US, Eurozone and China and the broader slowdown in the global economy. In particular, we expect outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing, maritime transport and finance and insurance to be adversely affected. However, we expect recovery in tourism-related and consumer-facing sectors to provide some support to growth. On balance, while Singapore’s economy grew by 4.3% year-on-year in the first three quarters of the year, growth is likely to moderate in the fourth quarter. For 2022 as a whole, the Singapore economy remains on track to expand by ""3% to 4%"".",2,1157,2022-11-07-T-036-S-01157

2022-11-07-T-063,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the current number of driving schools and driving instructors are able to meet the demands for practical driving lessons to obtain a Class 3 driving licence.,1,1274,2022-11-07-T-063-S-01274
2022-11-07-T-063,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As of September 2022, there are three driving schools with a total of 845 school instructors and an additional 345 private driving instructors.",1,1275,2022-11-07-T-063-S-01275
2022-11-07-T-063,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"From January to September 2022, the combined enrolment rate was 7,100 learner motorists per month for Class 3 and Class 3A licences. This is higher than pre-COVID-19 levels, where the enrolment rate was around 6,600 learner motorists per month. There is likely some pent-up demand from the pandemic period.",2,1276,2022-11-07-T-063-S-01276
2022-11-07-T-063,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Given the relatively higher enrolment rates now, learner motorists may have to wait longer before they can begin their driving lessons or may find it more difficult to book their desired lesson slots. The driving schools have been monitoring the situation and are actively hiring more driving instructors to meet the demand.",3,1277,2022-11-07-T-063-S-01277
2022-11-07-T-064,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Manpower in light of the recent historic fall in the pound sterling and the rise in the United Kingdom's borrowing costs, whether the Government has assessed the extent to which Singaporeans' CPF savings invested under the CPF Investment Scheme are directly or indirectly exposed to UK gilts and pension-linked funds.",1,1278,2022-11-07-T-064-S-01278
2022-11-07-T-064,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"CPF Investment Scheme, or CPFIS, is for CPF members who have the knowledge and time to invest and are prepared to take the risks.

2022-11-07-T-064,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Members’ investments under CPFIS are not directly exposed to risks associated with foreign products, such as UK gilts or UK pension-linked funds. This is because only products listed under the Singapore Exchange or registered with MAS are included in CPFIS. Based on our estimates, only $3.1 million out of the $22.6 billion invested in CPFIS has indirect exposure to UK gilts.",2,1280,2022-11-07-T-064-S-01280
2022-11-07-T-064,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Ultimately, as with all investments, members participating in CPFIS may be better or worse off, depending on their timing and selection of investments. Alternatively, members can leave their savings in their CPF accounts and earn interest of up to 6% per annum.",3,1281,2022-11-07-T-064-S-01281
2022-11-07-T-065,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Prime Minister in light of the recent historic fall in the pound sterling and the rise in the United Kingdom's borrowing costs, whether MAS has assessed the extent of Singaporean retail investors' exposure to UK gilts and pension-linked funds.",1,1282,2022-11-07-T-065-S-01282
2022-11-07-T-065,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Singapore retail investors would have minimal exposures to UK government securities, also known as gilts, or to UK pension-linked funds. Gilts are, as with most major government bonds, predominantly bought by institutional investors and financial institutions. UK pension-linked funds manage the pension monies of UK residents, and Singapore retail investors are unlikely to have invested directly in them.",1,1283,2022-11-07-T-065-S-01283

Following the public consultation, we aim to complete our review, including the possibility of allowing pet cats in HDB flats, in the later part of next year.",1,1286,2022-11-07-T-066-S-01286
2022-11-07-T-066,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As we review HDB’s pet ownership policies, we will carefully consider the feedback received through our various consultation channels. These include our online survey, which has gathered close to 30,000 responses so far, and our upcoming community dialogues and focus group discussions. In conducting the review, we will continue to balance the needs of different segments of the community, such as residents who would like to keep cats in their flats, and others who may have concerns about the disamenities caused by irresponsible cat ownership.",2,1287,2022-11-07-T-066-S-01287
2022-11-07-T-066,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will also place importance on protecting public health and animal welfare. For example, the possibility of regularising the keeping of pet cats in HDB flats will be studied alongside the proposal to introduce a licensing and microchipping scheme for pet cats. This would improve the traceability of pet cats, so that we can respond to animal disease outbreaks more effectively and better protect public health. In addition, this would allow us to hold irresponsible cat owners to greater account if their cats are found to be neglected, abused or abandoned.",3,1288,2022-11-07-T-066-S-01288

2022-11-07-T-070,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"Singapore’s population size is influenced by several factors. Our resident population, comprising Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, is affected by marriage and fertility rates, mortality trends and migration levels. The non-resident population is dependent on economic cycles and manpower requirements of our businesses, as well as the needs of Singaporean households for domestic help and caregiving.",1,1311,2022-11-07-T-070-S-01311
2022-11-07-T-070,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"The global economic outlook over the next three years remains uncertain and the effects of COVID-19 on population trends may persist for some time. While our population trajectory in the near term may experience some fluctuations, the pace of population growth in this decade is likely to remain slower than that in the previous decade, in line with trends before the pandemic hit. We expect our total population to remain significantly below 6.9 million by 2030.",2,1312,2022-11-07-T-070-S-01312

2022-11-07-T-071,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Government has (i) engaged local banks to understand what the primary inhibitions are that preclude longer fixed rate mortgage loans from being offered and (ii) conducted any studies on whether the absence of a separate, Government-backed home mortgage company has inhibited local banks from offering longer fixed-rate mortgages.",1,1314,2022-11-07-T-071-S-01314
2022-11-07-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime MInister),The benefits of longer-term fixed-rate mortgage loans do not necessarily outweigh their costs and risks to borrowers. There are two pertinent considerations.,1,1315,2022-11-07-T-071-S-01315
2022-11-07-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime MInister),"First, mortgage loans with a longer period of fixed rates offer repayment stability but could come at higher costs over the lifespan of the loan. Financial Institutions (FIs) offering fixed-rate loans bear the risks of interest rate volatility and higher opportunity cost of funds when rates rise and will price them at higher interest rates than floating rate loans. This can already be observed in the market today. For example, the introductory rates for a two-year fixed rate mortgage loan offered by the local banks currently range from 3.5% to 3.75%, higher than those for floating rate mortgage loans of about 3% offered by the same banks.",2,1316,2022-11-07-T-071-S-01316
2022-11-07-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime MInister),"Second, borrowers may not have as much flexibility to refinance their loans when interest rates fall, as longer-term fixed-rate loans come with longer lock-in periods. Whether the longer-term fixed-rate loan benefits the borrower depends on the interest rate conditions when the loan is taken up. In a period of higher and more volatile interest rates, such as what we face currently, borrowers who enter into longer fixed-rate terms are at risk of being locked in at such higher rates, for a longer period. This means that should interest rates eventually decline, these borrowers may not have the option to refinance out of their loans or may have to incur substantial costs in doing so.",3,1317,2022-11-07-T-071-S-01317
2022-11-07-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime MInister),"Local banks, currently, offer a range of mortgages with rates that are fixed for up to five years. According to the banks that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has engaged, these offerings reflect customer preferences. Borrowers, generally, prefer near-term certainty in their monthly repayments while still having an avenue to refinance their loans later. MAS has received feedback from the industry indicating that customers had a generally tepid reception to previous launches of longer-term fixed-rate mortgages.",4,1318,2022-11-07-T-071-S-01318
2022-11-07-T-071,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime MInister),"In the United States, government-backed home mortgage companies, namely, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, were established to provide liquidity, stability and affordability in the mortgage market. They purchase mortgages from lenders to either hold or repackage, guarantee and sell them as mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market, thus making more capital available for lenders to provide new mortgages. Singapore’s FIs have sound capital positions and stable funding. Their mortgage lending approach is not constrained by a lack of available funding and they have been able to meet customers’ needs without any support from Government-backed entities.",5,1319,2022-11-07-T-071-S-01319

2022-11-07-T-072,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"The 2021 Marriage and Parenthood survey shows that while the majority, or 80%, of young singles still intend to marry, this has declined, compared to 83% in 2016 and 86% in 2012.",1,1321,2022-11-07-T-072-S-01321
2022-11-07-T-072,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"Among those who did not intend to marry, the common reasons cited were the preference for individual freedom and comfort, the preference to concentrate on their studies or career, and not feeling that marriage would improve their lives. The survey also showed that many singles were not proactive about dating, commonly due to a limited social circle, lack of opportunities to meet potential partners and a preference to leave dating to chance.",2,1322,2022-11-07-T-072-S-01322
2022-11-07-T-072,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"The Government recognises that decisions to date and marry are deeply personal. We are, nevertheless, committed to creating a conducive environment where marriage and parenthood are achievable, fulfilling and celebrated. For example, to help Singaporeans better balance their career and family aspirations, we are fostering supportive workplaces through a stronger push for the adoption of flexible work arrangements. We have also extended support to those who are interested in dating and marrying, such as by helping singles expand their social network. The Social Development Network collaborates with commercial and community partners to facilitate events and programmes for singles to meet and interact, such as through offering lifestyle activities at subsidised costs.",3,1323,2022-11-07-T-072-S-01323

2022-11-07-T-074,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"MHA takes a very serious view of abuse and harassment of security officers.

2022-11-07-T-074,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The amendments have been in force since May 2022. Given that it has only been six months since, it is too early to conclude on their impact.

2022-11-07-T-075,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Home Affairs how is the Ministry working with private security agencies to ensure that security officers receive training to deal with those who seek to abuse them.,1,1332,2022-11-07-T-075-S-01332
2022-11-07-T-075,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Preventing and deterring abuse and harassment of security officers require the whole of society.

MOP for PLH flats is, therefore, set at 10 years. PLH projects also offer 3- and 4-room flats for young couples starting a family. In addition, MOP for other new and resale flats in non-PLH projects remains at five years. This gives home seekers a range of housing options to meet different needs.",2,1431,2022-11-07-T-101-S-01431

2022-11-07-T-110,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In pricing Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, HDB’s key consideration is to ensure affordability for flat buyers, especially first-timers. HDB first establishes the market value of the flat by considering the prevailing market conditions, prices of comparable resale flats nearby and the individual attributes of the flat, such as its location, floor area, storey height, orientation and accessibility to facilities, key transport nodes and amenities. A significant subsidy is then applied to ensure that new flats are affordable to those buying their first home. The prices of new BTO flats are substantially lower than comparable resale flats, and pricing information is published at every BTO launch. The amount of subsidy applied varies across launches, depending on the prevailing market conditions, location and attributes of the flats offered. As such, it is not meaningful to compare it across years.",1,1468,2022-11-07-T-110-S-01468
2022-11-07-T-110,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the past two years, even as construction costs increased by about 30%, we have managed to keep BTO flat prices relatively stable by increasing the subsidy applied. The average selling prices per square foot for BTO flats in 2012 and the first three quarters of 2022 are in Table 1 below.",2,1469,2022-11-07-T-110-S-01469

2022-11-07-T-110,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On top of the subsidy applied, HDB provides further housing grants to help specific demographic groups achieve their home ownership aspirations. These include the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant, Proximity Housing Grant and Step-Up CPF Housing Grant, and are not accounted for in the selling prices reflected in Table 1. Over the same period, the median resident employed household income grew by 26%, and housing grants had also been increased several times.",4,1471,2022-11-07-T-110-S-01471
2022-11-07-T-110,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Altogether, the effective price of a new HDB flat for first-timer buyers is, generally, four to five times that of their annual household income. The mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) also falls below 25% for most new and resale first-timer flat buyers who take on an HDB loan, which means that most flat buyers can service their housing loans using their monthly CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay.",5,1472,2022-11-07-T-110-S-01472
2022-11-07-T-110,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On land costs, HDB pays fair market value for the land that is purchased to develop HDB flats, which is determined independently by the Chief Valuer. Proceeds from HDB’s land purchase are paid back into the Past Reserves, which are, in turn, invested to generate returns for future generations of Singaporeans.",6,1473,2022-11-07-T-110-S-01473

2022-11-07-T-110,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Apart from land costs, HDB also incurs construction costs to build HDB flats. The total development cost, which includes construction and land costs, cannot be fully covered by the selling prices of flats. HDB thus incurs a significant deficit each year for the Home Ownership segment, and the deficit incurred in FY2021 ($3.85 billion) was almost double that of the previous year.",9,1476,2022-11-07-T-110-S-01476

2022-11-07-T-111,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the recent data breach at eight Shangri-La hotels in Asia (a) whether the personal data of any foreign dignitaries who attended the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore have been compromised; (b) how will this affect Singapore’s reputation as the host of a top-tier security-related conference; and (c) what is Singapore doing to prevent such breaches in such top level events in the future.,1,1478,2022-11-07-T-111-S-01478

The majority of the Shangri-La Hotel guests who attended the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD), especially dignitaries, registered in groups through their Embassies without submitting their personal details. Some hotel guests provided their personal particulars, and Shangri-La Group has informed them about the data breach.

2022-11-07-T-115,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Creating fair workplaces is a long-term effort that involves educating companies to adopt fair and objective hiring processes, building a positive culture that supports fair employment practices and reducing personal bias across all levels of the organisation. This effort needs to be sustained at all levels, including business owners, human resource practitioners, supervisors and hiring managers, and results will not be apparent overnight. To help employers in such efforts, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) runs public awareness campaigns and promotes the adoption of Tripartite Standards, an initiative to encourage employers to adopt verifiable and actionable employment practices in areas, such as recruitment, flexible work arrangements and grievance handling.",1,1492,2022-11-07-T-115-S-01492
2022-11-07-T-115,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"MOM monitors the overall adoption of fair workplace practices through several indicators. For example, MOM regularly conducts the Fair Employment Practices Survey – recent results have shown that the incidence of workplace discrimination based on resident employees’ experiences fell from 24% in 2018 to 8% in 2021. We also closely watch the trend of discrimination-related complaints and proactively identify higher-risk employers through data analytics. Enforcement actions will be taken against egregious employers but, for other employers, our focus is on engaging them to improve their workplace practices. For example, employers on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist have not flouted any rules but may have greater reliance on foreign manpower, compared to industry peers, or a high concentration of a single foreign nationality. Since 2016, TAFEP/MOM has completed more than 1,700 employer engagements under the FCF.",2,1493,2022-11-07-T-115-S-01493
