2022-11-08-T-001,Koh Lian Pin,Prof Koh Lian Pin,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment when is Singapore expected to peak its carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.,1,1,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00001
2022-11-08-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to address this question from Prof Koh Lian Pin and written Question No 14 from Member Ms He Ting Ru, as well as Question No 29 for oral answer raised by Prof Koh Lian Pin from yesterday, in a single reply, please?",1,2,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00002
2022-11-08-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please do.,1,3,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00003
2022-11-08-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The REACH public consultation on Singapore's Raised Climate Ambition was part of a comprehensive series of engagements that the Government has carried out since April 2022, under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Through these engagements, we have received feedback and views from more than 1,700 stakeholders. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has published the summary of feedback from these stakeholders, as well as more detailed feedback from the REACH public consultation on Singapore's Raised Climate Ambition on its website on 25 October 2022. Both reports address the question raised by Prof Koh Lian Pin.",1,4,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00004
2022-11-08-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Singapore Government has just submitted Singapore's Second Update to our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In the submission, we indicated that Singapore intends to reduce emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2030 after peaking our emissions earlier.",2,5,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00005
2022-11-08-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Peaking our emissions earlier than 2030 is significant and requires substantial transformations across industry, economy and society. Unlike countries that have access to abundant abatement resources domestically, Singapore has to rely on external measures, such as electricity imports and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Negotiations with foreign partners on several arrangements are still ongoing. As such, it is premature to announce a precise year in which our emissions will peak. The Government's best estimate is for our emissions to peak between 2025 and 2028, which will be earlier than our previous 2030 target, at around 65 million tonnes.",3,6,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00006
2022-11-08-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Notwithstanding these uncertainties, we remain committed to achieving what we set out in the Second Update to our 2030 NDC – for our emissions in 2030 to be around 60 million tonnes, or five million tonnes lower than what we set out in the First Update in 2020. This five million tonnes reduction is substantial. It is more than the total emissions from households today. We have put in place a comprehensive package of mitigation measures under the five pillars of the Green Plan to achieve this.",4,7,2022-11-08-T-001-S-00007
2022-11-08-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry can carry out educational publicity to remind residents not to go to the accident and emergency departments of public hospitals except for genuine emergencies; and (b) whether the Ministry can encourage more clinics to operate on a 24-hours basis.,1,8,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00008
2022-11-08-T-002,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is being done to reduce the waiting time for (i) consultation at the accident and emergency departments of public hospitals and (ii) ward beds at public hospitals; (b) whether the waiting time has reduced; and (c) if so, by how much.",1,9,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00009
2022-11-08-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether an in-depth analysis is being done to identify the underlying causes of the hospital bed crunch problem; (b) how will hospitals ensure that care for patients in holding spaces, including those with non-critical issues, will not be compromised; (c) what mechanism is in place for the different healthcare clusters to forecast and raise the alarm about possible upward demand at emergency departments to make necessary arrangements in advance; and (d) when is the bed crunch expected to ease.",1,10,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00010
2022-11-08-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) with the activation of inpatient teams to help at emergency departments, whether this will cause other healthcare teams to be overworked; (b) where will the manpower for transitional care facilities (TCFs), particularly the TCF with 364 beds, come from; (c) how well-equipped are healthcare workers and aides in the step-down facilities to care for transferred patients; and (d) what are the immediate measures to expand our healthcare teams, considering that some services cannot be automated in the short term.",1,11,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00011
2022-11-08-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the main reasons behind the long waiting times for admission at some restructured hospitals' emergency departments in recent weeks; and (b) what are the measures the Ministry is taking to reduce waiting time especially for patients with higher acuity conditions.,1,12,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00012
2022-11-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the current hospital bed crunch (a) whether non-urgent elective surgeries in public hospitals will be postponed; (b) if so, whether this will once more result in a backlog after the current bed crunch is alleviated; and (c) how will the Ministry prevent the occurrences of deferring non-urgent treatments from turning into a vicious cycle of care backlog.",1,13,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00013
2022-11-08-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the critical bottlenecks in hospitals resulting in patients being held for long periods of time at emergency departments; (b) whether this has resulted in ambulances being unable to be deployed for other emergencies; and (c) what steps is the Ministry taking to more permanently resolve the lack of bed spaces in public hospitals.,1,14,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00014
2022-11-08-T-002,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the risk of suffering from pressure injuries amongst bedridden patients who are kept for significant lengths of time at the accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals before being admitted to the wards is being monitored; and (b) whether such patients may be screened in advance for their susceptibility to develop pressure injuries and treated accordingly.,1,15,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00015
2022-11-08-T-002,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider developing a gatekeeping role and process at the polyclinics and GP clinics to reduce the number of patients whose conditions do not require emergency care at hospital emergency departments.,1,16,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00016
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I address Question Nos 2 to 10 in today's Order Paper, please?",1,17,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00017
2022-11-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please proceed.,1,18,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00018
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Sir, during the Delta wave last year, our  Intensive Care Unit (",1,19,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00019
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, over the past year, I have reported to this House on several occasions that although we did not let the virus overwhelm our healthcare system, our hospitals and, especially, the EDs, have been very busy.",2,20,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00020
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Why are the hospitals still experiencing heavy workload, given that life has gone back to pre-COVID-19 normal?",3,21,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00021
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The simple and fundamental reason is that the pandemic is not over. It may feel like it is over for most of us, but it certainly is not over for hospitals and our healthcare workers. We are learning to live with the virus, as an endemic disease. As I have explained to the House before, endemicity does not mean the virus disappears from our lives. On the contrary, it means that it is a permanent feature of our lives, circulating amongst us and we have to take personal precautions and implement public health measures in order to manage and live with it.",4,22,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00022
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"What are these public health measures? Essentially, there are three. First, the safe management measures (SMMs) to restrict social interactions and, therefore, reduce viral transmission. Two, transmission still happens and, therefore, we do vaccinations, so that infections do not translate into many cases of severe illnesses and deaths.",5,23,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00023
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When these two cannot prevent cases, the third lever – which is our healthcare system – will then have to manage; it has to catch the problem and then, manage it by treating and caring for infected patients who become severely ill.",6,24,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00024
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let us take stock of the three measures. For SMMs, we have removed almost all restrictions, so that life goes back to the pre-COVID-19 normal. This is what all Singaporeans wish for and the whole point of treating COVID-19 as an endemic disease. Therefore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been very reluctant to re-impose SMMs, unless it is absolutely necessary.",7,25,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00025
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second public measure, vaccinations. We have already covered the great majority – over 90% – of our population. Our vaccination exercise is ongoing, but this is largely to extend our coverage at the margins, namely, now, infants and very young children, and to keep vaccinations up-to-date for the others. So, we are just maintaining our immunity and resilience, now no longer able to achieve the kind of quantum improvement in resilience that we could achieve when we first started our national vaccination programme.",8,26,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00026
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"That means that the burden of endemicity will fall disproportionately on the last public health measure – which is our healthcare system. That is why our wards and EDs have been very busy over the past year. The media highlighted it only recently, but really, our hospitals have been experiencing it for the whole year.",9,27,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00027
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I hope that as we enjoy our hard-fought freedom from COVID-19, we remember the toil and sacrifice of our healthcare workers – doctors, nurses, social care workers and so on. They are sacrificing and toiling away, in order to secure freedom and the state of endemicity for the rest of society. So, COVID-19 may feel like it is over for many of us; it is not over for them.",10,28,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00028
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the hospitals and EDs, therefore, service levels may drop and waiting times become longer. Out of frustration, we understand that there will be public complaints, but I sincerely hope that our hospitals and healthcare workers will continue to receive the appreciation, understanding and support of all Singaporeans.",11,29,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00029
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Sir, let me now describe what exactly is the situation at the EDs today. First, I want to assure the House, that for critically ill patients, they are attended to almost immediately at the EDs, due to the way that we triage patients and allocate resources. So, priority always goes to them.",12,30,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00030
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For non-life-threatening but emergency cases, the median waiting times for consultation across all our EDs are averaged to about 20 minutes from January to September this year. It is not a very long wait, and it is important for this group of patients to be attended to quickly, so that they are evaluated and then can be discharged promptly.",13,31,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00031
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For emergency cases that require hospital admission – this is where the bottleneck is – the median waiting times for wards is about seven hours, from January to September. It is a few hours longer than 2019. What I quoted, ""seven hours"", that is the median. There are variations. So, when we have an infection wave, like recently, waiting times can spike up sharply – to the reported 50 hours – for certain hospitals that are busier.",14,32,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00032
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Despite the heavy workload, our hospitals will not compromise the safety of patients. As mentioned earlier, life-threatening cases will be attended to immediately. If surgery is required, it will be carried out promptly and beds will be there for the patients.",15,33,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00033
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For non-life-threatening patients who are waiting for admission, medical teams will continue to monitor them and institute appropriate investigations and treatments.",16,34,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00034
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For bedridden patients who are at higher risk of developing pressure injuries, hospitals will implement preventive nursing interventions. This includes the use of thicker mattresses or air mattresses, turning of the patients periodically and changing of diapers and drawsheets for bedridden patients.",17,35,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00035
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Sir, I will now address the most pertinent question, which is what can we do about crowded EDs, to alleviate the problem?",18,36,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00036
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The current situation, make no mistake, is not sustainable, and we need to resolve it. But it has not been easy to solve the problem as we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Each time a wave subsides and we started dealing with the problem, another wave would come, and attention and resources will be diverted to fight fire again.",19,37,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00037
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"With the XBB wave subsiding earlier than expected, we hope that this time round, we will have the time and space to deal with the problem properly and decisively. To do so, we need to diagnose where exactly is the operational bottleneck.",20,38,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00038
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The issue actually is not the ED. It is really about matching the demand and supply of hospital beds. The crowdedness and long waiting times for patients at the EDs in some hospitals, especially during a wave, is a manifestation of the problem, a mismatch of demand and supply of hospital beds.",21,39,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00039
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let us look at the demand for hospital beds. If we look at average monthly ED attendances, which translate into demand for hospital beds – from 2019, before COVID-19 started – to 2022, there is a reduction from 75,000 patients per month to 63,000 patients per month. So, translated to daily attendances, it was about 2,500 patients a day in 2019 to 2,100 patients a day in 2022. This is a 16% decrease.",22,40,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00040
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, it would appear that all of our measures to educate the public to not go to EDs unless absolutely necessary, the GPFirst initiative and the setting up Urgent Care Centres in the heartlands as an alternative – they have all worked. Or there can be a simple reason – that during a pandemic, people actually do not like to go to EDs; that is also a possible reason.",23,41,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00041
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, while the overall number dropped, if you look at all ED attendances, the proportion of patients with highest acuity – this means they have the most serious conditions and need the most attention and probably need hospital beds – had increased from about 8% in 2019 to 11% in 2022. In absolute numbers, this is an increase of a few hundred patients per month. It is not huge but it does add to the operational burden of hospitals.",24,42,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00042
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"More importantly, I think, is this point, we are again looking at averages. While the average number has come down, during a pandemic, that number is a lot more volatile. So, during an infection wave, many more infected people and recovered patients go to EDs.",25,43,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00043
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For example, at the peak of the mid-year Omicron wave and the recent XBB wave, COVID-19 infected patients added another 600 ED visits every day. This is 30% more workload at the ED, which is very significant.",26,44,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00044
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I should mention a separate problem that we now encounter at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH). The ED has been experiencing very high visits every day – at levels that they used to experience only during Chinese New Year, when all other clinics are closed. So, come Chinese New Year this round, I do not know what kind of numbers they are going to get.",27,45,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00045
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is a separate problem, due to what we call an ""immunity debt"" in children. It means that for the past two years, SMMs – including mask wearing – has shielded children from many forms of viral infection, and not just COVID-19. Now that life is back to normal, viral infections are making a strong comeback and demanding payback – with interest!",28,46,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00046
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Let us look at the supply side of the hospital beds. There are a few factors constraining the supply and slowing down the process of warding ED patients.,29,47,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00047
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, due to our ageing population, there is a secular trend of rising numbers of patients with long stays and that reduces the turnover of hospital beds. To illustrate, the percentage of patients who stay longer than 21 days has doubled from 1.6% of all hospitalised patients in 2019 to 3.8% in 2022.",30,48,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00048
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, the pandemic caused construction disruptions which delayed the opening of healthcare facilities, namely the Woodlands Health Campus and the Integrated Care Hub at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. If these facilities had opened as originally planned in 2022 without the COVID-19-related delays, they would have added at least a few hundred beds to our system and would have alleviated the problem.",31,49,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00049
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Similarly, construction delays due to the pandemic have also postponed the opening of several nursing homes and community day care facilities, and that also constrained the ability of hospitals to discharge less acute patients and free up hospital beds.",32,50,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00050
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Third, supply constraints. As part of our emergency planning, hospitals are required now to set aside, or ringfence, beds for the care of COVID-19 patients. Members of the House may recall at the height of the pandemic – and at that time we were imposing SMMs to preserve healthcare capacity – many Parliamentary Questions were filed, asking the Ministry of Health (MOH) if we had planned for adequate healthcare capacity in such emergency scenarios.",33,51,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00051
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Well, ringfencing hospital beds for COVID-19 patients is part of that planning effort. However, we inject flexibility into the plan, raising or lowering the number of ringfenced beds according to the pandemic situation. So, for example, again, at the peak of the recent XBB wave, we set aside 800 beds for COVID-19 patients, as ringfence. About 80% were occupied at the peak of the wave, which meant we still had 160 beds unoccupied for contingency purposes. Not a big number, but nevertheless, constrains hospital operations and impedes the clearing of patients waiting at EDs.",34,52,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00052
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Whether due to demand or supply factors, we need to recognise this – that is, we run a very high throughput hospital system. In such a system, even a very small mismatch of demand and supply, a couple of hundred beds, will cause waiting times to spike up very significantly. You think of it that way – it is not very different from an expressway with very heavy traffic flow. All it needs is for one branch to fall on one lane or half a lane, and you will have a massive traffic jam. We have a similar situation in a very high throughput hospital system.",35,53,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00053
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, how do we resolve the current problem? The hospital clusters, working with MOH, have issued a statement recently, outlining all the measures they are taking. They continue to be relevant and we will continue to pursue them.",36,54,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00054
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Just to briefly recap, they include the reducing of EDs demand through primary care, alternative pre-hospital care options; educating the public to use EDs only when absolutely necessary; diverting them to nearby primary care clinics; and coordinating with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to divert less serious cases away to less crowded EDs.",37,55,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00055
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We are also actively transferring patients in acute hospitals to step down or home care whenever possible. We are partnering private hospitals, such as Raffles Hospital, to accept patients sent by SCDF ambulances for emergency medical treatment and we also offer subsidised rates even though treatment is at Raffles Hospital.",38,56,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00056
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"New nursing homes are coming on stream and they are very helpful during the XBB wave. From the end of next year, Woodlands Health Campus and Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub should start to open progressively. Over the next five years, we target to add about 1,900 more public hospital beds, including the aforementioned two projects, and also the expanded Singapore General Hospital Medical Campus.",39,57,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00057
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But today, let me focus on two important structural adjustments that we will make which will hopefully help to alleviate the crowdedness at EDs in the short term.",40,58,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00058
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Number one, we will activate more TCFs, what we call Transitional Care Facilities. Three TCFs are already in operation, with a total of 400 beds. These are operated by private providers at wards at Sengkang Community Hospital, Changi Expo Hall 10 and Crawfurd Hospital, along Farrer Road, which just opened a few days ago.",41,59,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00059
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The TCFs serve a special purpose. They admit medically stable patients from public hospitals while they wait for their transfers to intermediate or long-term care facilities, or for their discharge plans to be finalised. It is, therefore, a very important step-down care facility, to free up acute beds in hospitals.",42,60,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00060
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But TCFs are not just about providing beds space that is operated by private hospitals. There has to be a very firm handshake between the TCF operator and a public hospital. Because with that firm handshake, the privately operated TCF will gain confidence in admitting patients transferred by a public hospital – because they will feel assured that should they need any clinical help, in unforseen circumstances and for some complications, the public hospital will still step in. Without this understanding, TCFs will naturally be very conservative in admitting patients and there will be very little movement in stable patients.",43,61,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00061
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The Sengkang Community Hospital TCF run by Thomson Medical Centre is a very good example. They have a very strong partnership now with Sengkang General Hospital.,44,62,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00062
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We will replicate this, to pair up Changi General Hospital with Expo Hall 10 run by Raffles Medical Group; and Tan Tock Seng Hospital with Crawfurd Hospital. We are actively working on new TCFs in the north and in the west, to partner Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital respectively.",45,63,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00063
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second structural shift  our approach to living with COVID-19 needs to be extended to hospital operations as well. It is time for us adopt a more flexible and balanced approach to hospital bed assignments. We should move away from ringfencing beds just for COVID-19 patients. We had done so in the earlier stages of the pandemic, when hospitalised COVID-19 patients faced a very high chance of developing severe illnesses and numbers can spike very high during an infection wave. Hence, reserving beds – actually, we reserved wards – is the appropriate thing to do.",46,64,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00064
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, we are now at the stage when most residents have been vaccinated and boosted or recovered safely from COVID-19 and have good levels of hybrid immunity against severe illnesses. We should, therefore, allow hospitals to triage or assess their patients based on clinical severity and priority for treatment, and not manage COVID-19 patients to a different standard. This flexibility is important for our hospitals to help them optimise the use of beds. In a crunch situation, just like the expressway with very high throughput, it makes all the difference.",47,65,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00065
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"With this change, hospitals will no longer set aside whole wards to cohort COVID-19 positive patients as a standard pandemic practice. They will continue their current practice of using isolation beds for patients with infectious diseases, including COVID-19, if there is a risk of infection spread.",48,66,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00066
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is not a sudden change, but a transition process that has started and is ongoing. Hospitals will continue to exercise various precautionary measures on infection control to protect the vulnerable and prevent spreading of infectious diseases in hospitals. They have done so for many years, for influenza, for all kinds of infectious diseases. They will apply the same measures now for COVID-19, but without setting aside entire wards which will stall their operations.",49,67,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00067
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Beyond these two structural measures, every one of us can do our part. While ED attendances have fallen compared to 2019, non-urgent cases still make up 40% of all ED attendances. We can use EDs more judiciously. Use alternatives, such a general practitioner (GP) clinic or call our family doctors.",50,68,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00068
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We should exercise social responsibility, such as staying at home and self-testing when not feeling well. Most importantly, we need to continue to keep our vaccinations up-to-date and prevent ourselves from falling severely ill if we are infected by COVID-19. Today, a senior without minimum vaccination protection is still about three times more likely to end up in hospital and needing to be warded, than one with minimum vaccination protection. So, by taking another jab to keep vaccination up-to-date, you may well be freeing up an additional hospital bed.",51,69,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00069

2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The backlog is not huge. Because ever since we started opening up, hospitals have all realised that to postpone electives and postpone non-urgent surgery, it all comes back after a while – and with interest usually. So, for the past two or three waves, we have been very reluctant to postpone these electives. In the recent wave, we postponed some, but only 5% to 10%. So, it is not a huge backlog and certainly we will want to clear it as soon as possible.",1,75,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00075

2022-11-08-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thank you, Speaker. May I ask the Minister, what can we do to encourage more clinics to open 24-hour services. Earlier this year, my 90-year-old mother was ill and I just found it so difficult to find a 24-hour clinic. So, if MOH can encourage more clinics to open for longer hours, that will certainly help. Otherwise, my option was to send her to the emergency department.",1,77,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00077
2022-11-08-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The second question, Sir, is TCFs, will that be a difference in cost because these would be run by private clinics? So, if I am a patient going to a TCF, I would be concerned about the cost.",2,78,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00078
2022-11-08-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"And finally, what is the percentage of space that is available, when you free up the number of beds for COVID-19 purposes?",3,79,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00079
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for his questions. The short answer is we will try to encourage it, but opening for 24 hours is not easy. They will need a few doctors to cover each other. Many clinics do open to late at night and, hopefully, with something like Healthier SG, we are changing the mindset of GPs and also changing health-seeking behaviour. Hopefully, we will get more help from GPs in attending to some of these urgent cases. For your mother, if it is in the middle of the night, I think going to ED is probably justified.",1,80,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00080
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Two, TCFs cost no different from public hospitals. We are running these and subsidising them in the same way.",2,81,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00081
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And finally, the percentage, or number of beds that would be freed up, I gave a ballpark just now at the peak of the Omicron variant XBB wave, we were still setting aside 160 beds at the peak; sterilised it, ringfenced it, even though we had patients waiting downstairs because we were afraid of a spike of COVID-19 patients. Off-peak, the number was actually larger. So, I would say, at least 200 to 300 beds. And I think they will make a big difference to the operation of hospitals.",3,82,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00082

2022-11-08-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, I am heartened to hear that TCFs will be paired with our hospitals. Notwithstanding, would there be enough healthcare workers to run the TCFs, given the overall tightened manpower situation in our hospitals?",1,84,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00084
2022-11-08-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, how is MOH supporting our healthcare workers to do their work more efficiently and to prevent burnout during this period of high patient load?",2,85,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00085
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We know that healthcare workers are never enough. There is a manpower crunch and intense competition between different countries trying to hire healthcare workers. Fortunately, this is something we can solve in the short term, over a few months, by recruiting, training them and putting them in place. So, this is something we are doing actively. Now that the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, borders are opening up, we have started our overseas recruitment process as well as continue to work with our local institutions to bring in more healthcare workers.",1,86,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00086
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second question on how to prevent burnout, if we solve all these jam problems, manage the pandemic and move to endemicity form of operations, I think it will go a great extent to reduce the workload.",2,87,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00087

2022-11-08-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for his reply. I deeply appreciate all our healthcare workers and staff – from doctors to nurses to hospital receptionists – for their tireless efforts in caring for patients. Both they and the patients suffer tremendous stress when the queues of patients build up. So, I have two clarifications for the Minister.",1,89,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00089
2022-11-08-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"First, I understand that some patients are not discharged because the downstream care facilities are not available to receive and accommodate them. The Minister said just now that there were some delays in the opening of nursing homes and daycare facilities, and transitional care facilities are being used to reduce the burden on acute care hospitals. Can the Ministry also look into providing more home support for patients to help their families care for the patients who are suitable for discharge from acute care hospitals?",2,90,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00090
2022-11-08-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And secondly, queue clearance depends, in part, on the ability to triage and diagnose arriving patients and this, in turn, is limited by the number of qualified healthcare professionals. Is the Ministry looking at giving greater responsibilities to nurses so that they can take on more of the responsibilities that are currently being done by doctors?",3,91,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00091
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We are certainly looking at home discharge as well. In fact, that is a major initiative. So, in a complex system like that, it is all of the above – whether it is a nursing home, step-down care, community hospital, home discharge. We will look at all of them.",1,92,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00092
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Just a point on home discharge  actually, it is quite manpower intensive. Because once you bring a patient home, a nurse does have to visit them, call them; but it frees up the bed spaces. So, it does add to the workload of nurses. So, we are managing different resources as optimally as we can. But this is a major area that, at some point, we should discuss further with Healthier SG, ageing-in-place, home nursing is a very important prong.",2,93,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00093
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, on triage, I think nurses are already doing some of the triaging. And certainly, with our move to Healthier SG, preventive care, bringing healthcare into the community away from the hospitals, there is a lot more our nurses, allied health professionals and pharmacists can do. It is a direction we are moving towards.",3,94,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00094

I also want to express my deep appreciation to our healthcare workers, especially the doctors, nurses and staff working in the EDs, some of whom are my personal friends and I have seen how they have persevered through these few years of COVID-19 pandemic. And I am journeying with them. I have two supplementary questions.",1,96,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00096
2022-11-08-T-002,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Pertaining to the GPFirst initiative that was piloted in Changi General Hospital back in 2014, how many of our current slate of about 1,800 GP clinics are on it?",2,97,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00097
2022-11-08-T-002,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"My second supplementary question is that I have spoken to some of the GPs in my Jalan Kayu constituency about the situation in the EDs and what is the role that they can play, especially under Healthier SG to be part of the solution for the ecosystem. They have asked whether there can be more practical resources, such as a peer-to-peer call line for them to reach out to their Accident and Emergency (A&E) doctor counterparts in the public hospitals in the region so that they can triage and also assure the patients that the conditions may not warrant an ED admission.",3,98,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00098
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member. First question, I do not have the number. Maybe the Member can file another Parliamentary Question? GPs can certainly take a load off the EDs. First, open 24 hours; if not, open at night, make yourself available to telemedicine; you can assuage the concerns of many patients and avoid the ED visits. As to whether to set up a call line to EDs, I suppose the more they call, it does add to the workload of EDs as well. Notwithstanding that, I think we can approach the Agency for Intergrated Care (AIC), and AIC will help link up with the nearest EDs.",1,99,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00099

2022-11-08-T-002,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Speaker. I have one supplementary question for the Minister. There may be elderly facing non-life-threatening cases who may not have been able to share their condition while waiting for a doctor to see them at the A&E. They may have felt nauseous, cold, scared, hungry. How then does MOH identify or how then do the nurses identify such cases and help comfort them during that waiting period?",1,101,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00101
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When the queue is long and you start to have crowded EDs, the nurses do that. I think they have the skills to do that, including the language ability, because in a team, there will be multiple language skills and they would be able to comfort the elderly. I think the problem that the Member raised is probably a result of very crowded EDs, when nurses are under tremendous pressure, so the kind of attention is probably not given, compared to normal times.",1,102,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00102
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, I think we still go back to the same problem we raised earlier, that if we can resolve the crowdedness at the EDs, I think the problem that the Member raised will be addressed.",2,103,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00103

2022-11-08-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Sir. The Minister mentioned about the non-urgent cases attended by EDs. I understand some are because the clinics could not cope and refer the patients to EDs – including some polyclinics, I understand. So, can I ask the Minister – he mentioned about TCF, whether that can also be another place? So, can clinics refer patients to a TCF instead of going to the EDs?",1,105,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00105
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,A TCF is not quite the place to refer ED cases to. It is more a step-down care facility. But what we are doing is setting up more Urgent Care Centres (UCCs). We have one in Admiralty and that has been very useful.,1,106,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00106
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ultimately, it goes back to how we diagnose a problem. Reducing non-emergency cases to EDs certainly will help. But that is not the main bottleneck today. The main bottleneck remains a mismatch in demand and supply of hospital beds, which leads to long waiting times at the EDs, waiting for wards and crowding the EDs.

Does the Minister have some indication as to when that demand is likely to taper or is it a case of having to stand up more beds in  KKH over time?",1,109,2022-11-08-T-002-S-00109
2022-11-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The bed situation for paediatrics is actually quite okay.

2022-11-08-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you, Sir. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has estimated that households and individuals paid around $6.8 billion of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) annually in 2018 and 2019, after netting off refunds under the Tourist Refund Scheme. After further netting off GST Vouchers (GSTV) of over $1 billion provided annually to Singaporean households, the net annual GST from households and individuals was estimated to be around $5.7 billion.",1,116,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00116
2022-11-08-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Tourists and foreigners residing in Singapore accounted for around 50% of this net GST, while the top 20% of resident households accounted for close to 20%.",2,117,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00117

2022-11-08-T-003,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. Just two follow-up questions. The first is, I am wondering whether the benefit of the additional revenue gain from an estimated, as he had shared, 50% drawn from foreigners and non-residents may actually be worth the additional pain that our middle class will need to endure? I speak especially for our sandwich generation in my constituency of Sengkang, where households who earn sufficiently high incomes nevertheless receive limited support, in terms of support programmes from the Government and continue to face high expenses supporting their children and parents, which will now be subject to a higher GST.",1,121,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00121
2022-11-08-T-003,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"My second question has to do with whether the Ministry has also studied the incidence of the tax. Because, as we know, the burden need not fall on the party which the tax is levied on. To put it another way, the higher GST charges may well crimp demand at the margin, and this may result in Singaporean businesses bearing the burden of reduced demand and hence, lower profits, rather than foreigners paying more, even if it looks like the revenue comes from foreigners. Does the MOF have any estimates of the relative share of GST that will be paid for explicitly by foreign consumers versus local businesses?",2,122,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00122
2022-11-08-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, the first question from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim – if I understood him correctly – because I shared earlier that 50% of the net GST is borne by foreigners and tourists, he asked whether that GST collection is worth it – if I understood him correctly.",1,123,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00123
2022-11-08-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, we have explained that if you look at the package that we have designed, due to the support package and due to permanent features like the GST Voucher, the bulk of the net GST that the Government collects is borne by two groups of people. If you look at the total amount, 50% comes from tourists and foreigners residing in Singapore and about 20% comes from the top 20% of households.",2,124,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00124
2022-11-08-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"What this means is that the remaining 30% is spread over the rest of the 80% of households and individuals. So, yes, there will certainly be some part of the net GST that is paid for by different groups of society, different income quintiles, including the middle-income and the upper middle-income. So, if you look at the middle 40th to 60th, and also the 60th to the 80th, certainly, I think they do bear some of the GST. But the impact of the GST that they bear is not the full amount. The bulk of the net GST that is collected is borne by foreigners and the top 20% of households, and the remaining 30% of the net GST is spread over this remaining 80% of households and individuals.",3,125,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00125
2022-11-08-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"In addition to that, Sir, we have also shared earlier that we provide support, to include the middle-income households. So, the support that goes to lower-income households is a lot more because they are more vulnerable and they are more affected by price increases. But in designing the support packages, what was announced in Budget this year and the two packages of $1.5 billion each, we did not leave out the middle-income. In fact, part of those packages included the middle-income.",4,126,2022-11-08-T-003-S-00126

2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 15 to 17 together?",1,134,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00134
2022-11-08-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,135,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00135
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We are at a critical juncture in the development of our energy market. Since the 1990s, we have operated an open energy market and this has served us well. A competitive market has incentivised generation companies (gencos) to bring in new and more efficient technologies and they also offered more choices for consumers. Many consumers have also enjoyed lower electricity prices as a result.",1,136,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00136
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"However, the energy landscape has changed drastically, and new sources of supply risks and volatilities have emerged.",2,137,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00137
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"First, heightened volatility arising from tight power generation capacity. This has emerged in liberalised markets all around the world, where capacity planting decisions are made by private gencos based on short-term price signals in the wholesale electricity market. For these gencos, high electricity prices typically signal that capacity is tight and that new generation plantings are, therefore, needed. However, very often, these price signals can come a bit too late and it takes about four to five years typically to build a new generator. The time lag between the price signals and the construction of new generators, therefore, leads to shortages of generation capacity and can lead to sharp spikes and protracted elevation of electricity prices and even blackouts during periods of system stress, as we saw in some cities last year.",3,138,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00138
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Second, supply risks and volatility arising from disruptions in global gas supply. As we rely on imported natural gas for almost all of our electricity production, global supply and demand shocks will spill over into our domestic electricity market. As fuel prices surged last year, our electricity market was severely tested. Gencos were reluctant to contract for gas, for fear that they would be left holding on to expensive gas inventories should prices moderate subsequently. This, in turn, increased the risks of gas shortfalls and it caused prices in the wholesale electricity market to surge.",4,139,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00139
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Third, volatility arising from failures in intermediaries. We observed this in the fourth quarter of last year, where six electricity retailers exited the market as they were not sufficiently prepared to deal with the extreme market volatilities. While affected consumers did not experience any disruptions to their power supply, some of them experienced inconveniences as well as price surges while sourcing for alternative electricity retail contracts and they faced higher prices.",5,140,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00140
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"These sources of volatility have tested our energy market over the past year, with the ongoing energy crisis. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has put in place emergency measures which have helped to stabilise the market. However, Members of the House, this is unlikely to be the last energy crunch that we will face, and we would need to be even more prepared for a more volatile global energy market going forward.",6,141,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00141
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We will, therefore, need to introduce safeguards to manage the risks of volatilities in our energy market. Last month, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced that it would be introducing guardrails to strengthen our energy market in three key areas – power generation, gas supply and electricity retail markets. These guardrails are intended to ensure that our energy market continues to function well even under volatile conditions.",7,142,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00142
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, allow me to broadly recap these measures for this House.",8,143,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00143
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"First, to ensure that we continue to have sufficient generation capacity in time to come, EMA will introduce a centralised approach to facilitate investments in new generation through a competitive tender. The tender will be conducted in advance of when the new capacity is needed, taking into account the lead time which is required for construction and development. Should there be inadequate private sector interest to plant new capacity, EMA will step in to build the required new capacity.",9,144,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00144
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Second, to safeguard energy security and enhance the resilience of our natural gas supply, we will institutionalise some of the measures that we had introduced late last year to safeguard energy security as permanent features of our market. These are the regulations requiring gencos to maintain sufficient fuel for power generation and the standby fuel facility to guard against risks of gas supply disruptions. EMA will also be working with the industry to explore ways to aggregate gas procurement and obtain longer-term, more secure contracts.",10,145,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00145
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Ms He Ting Ru have asked about our measures to strengthen the electricity retail market. We will enhance the regulatory requirements imposed on electricity retailers, to ensure that they are sufficiently prepared and that they are better able to withstand market volatilities. The regulatory enhancements include raising the qualifying criteria so that only credible industry participants with sufficient financial strength and sustainable business propositions will be allowed to retail electricity to consumers. As for whether EMA will prohibit retailers from prematurely terminating contracts with their consumers, this is already the case under the Code of Conduct for Retail Electricity Licensees. Retailers cannot unilaterally terminate contracts unless under stipulated conditions, such as if they are exiting the sector, or consumers are insolvent or had a breach of contract. EMA will be launching a consultation in the coming weeks on specific proposals to enhance the regulatory requirements for retailers.",11,146,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00146
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"For consumers, EMA will look into tightening the eligibility criteria for Wholesale Electricity Price (WEP) plans, so that only larger consumers who are better equipped to deal with the risks of price volatilities would be allowed to enter into such plans. All consumers will continue to have the option of entering into retail contracts with electricity retailers, or, in the case of households and small business consumers, returning to the regulated tariff.",12,147,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00147
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,EMA is also in discussion with market participants on operational measures to strengthen the wholesale electricity market.,13,148,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00148
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Members of the House, our experience over the past year has demonstrated that a robust wholesale electricity market can have a stabilising influence on the broader retail market, and is an important pillar of our efforts to strengthen the electricity retail market.",14,149,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00149
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"EMA will consult the industry as well as the public on the details of these enhancements. We plan to implement them progressively from 2023 onwards. We welcome feedback and suggestions from Members of this House, the industry and members of the public on our enhancements.",15,150,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00150
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, all of these measures will incur higher costs. I would like to reassure Mr Louis Chua that in implementing these measures, MTI and EMA will do so in a calibrated way to balance the cost burden, while ensuring that electricity continues to remain affordable. But the value of a more stable, secure and resilient energy system cannot be overstated. It is fundamental and foundational to our ability to grow our economy, to create good jobs for our people and to maintain our quality of life. EMA will continue to do its best to ensure that Singaporeans can continue to enjoy a stable, secure and reliable source of electricity for years to come.",16,151,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00151

2022-11-08-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have just two supplementary questions for the Second Minister.",1,153,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00153
2022-11-08-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I read recently that Indonesia will extend its gas supply contract to Singapore by about five years. I think it was announced over the past week. But, reportedly, based on a Reuters article, distribution volume is reportedly 30% to 40% lower but at higher prices. So, in light of these guardrails which, I recognise, strengthen our gas supply agreements, what is the expected change in the mix between piped natural gas and liquified natural gas (LNG) over the next five years and beyond when this new contract expires?",2,154,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00154
2022-11-08-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Secondly – and this is related to my original Parliamentary Question – in terms of the expected increase in the cost of electricity eventually, what is the increase in this gas supply pricing agreement versus what was agreed on in the prior contract?",3,155,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00155
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Currently, the majority of the gas supply comes from piped natural gas and the balance from liquefied natural gas.",1,156,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00156
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"As the Member would have known, we have our Singapore LNG (SLNG) terminal and this terminal allows us to import liquefied natural gas from all over the world. And the mix – I do not have it off-the-cuff today – I think that it is probably about 60 40, or 40% LNG. So, that drop from the new gas contract that was signed and entered into – I think that it was announced today – between Gas Supply Pte Ltd (GSPL) and MedcoEnergi (Medco), there is some drop. But the drop will be made up for by imports through LNG. And the shortened period today, the new gas contract of five years, is also a function of the volatility in terms of the pricing that countries all over the world are going through and experiencing.",2,157,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00157
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"If the price is pegged at too high a level, then obviously, the ability for us to import LNG from other parts of the world would become more attractive. So, it is actually a fine balance. This is a commercial arrangement between GSPL and the Indonesian entity, just like for the imports of natural gas from other entities, those are also private commercial agreements. I do not think the Government should comment on these things.",3,158,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00158
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the point about how these gas prices will translate into higher cost, natural gas, over the medium term, is still one of the most environmentally-friendly transition fuel as we move towards our zero-carbon emission target by 2050.",4,159,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00159
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"As we progressively move towards renewable energy imports from the region to the ASEAN regional grid, as we adopt and intensify our land use for solar power adoption, as we move towards funding, going into more research into the carbon capture storage solutions, as we go into hydrogen – there is a Parliamentary Question, if we get there, which I will speak more on later – we believe that the dependency in the long haul on natural gas will start to drop.",5,160,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00160
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"However, I think the caution that I want to add to this House is that the transition towards renewable energy may not necessarily result in cheaper electricity, because there is a cost in terms of adopting green sources of renewable energy. I hope that clarifies.",6,161,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00161

2022-11-08-T-005,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Speaker. I have just one follow-up supplementary question for the Minister. This relates to retail consumer protection. Will EMA or MTI consider strengthening retail consumer protection and safeguards such as the ease of transfer ability or novation of consumer contracts to alternative retailers, or also maybe a recourse mechanism for a more cost-efficient and expeditious consumer-related dispute resolution.",1,163,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00163
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Ms Nadia for her question. Indeed, EMA will launch a consultation in the coming weeks on specific proposals to enhance some of these regulatory measures and requirements for retailers. As part of the consultation, we will be releasing more details in the coming weeks. We want to reassure the Member that in tightening regulatory requirements, EMA will also strengthen safeguards for consumers affected by exiting retailers, or even retailers who want to novate their agreements. So, the short answer is, we will be consulting more, and we will be tweaking and also improving on the existing suite.",1,164,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00164
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"One of the key takeaway is that, the energy market, the Open Electricity Market (OEM) has worked well for us thus far; it has resulted in a lot more efficiencies in terms of the pricing mechanism. What has worked, has worked based on a certain band of volatility. In this particular period of time and in the foreseeable three to five years, as I have shared in my earlier speech, the volatility range has increased significantly. And the existing frameworks would now have to be tweaked, to take into consideration the heightened range, the increase range of volatilities and it is timely for us to also do this public consultation exercise to see how we can work collectively together. As I have also exhorted the House  Members, if you have ideas, please share them with us, we are happy to take them on board.",2,165,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00165

2022-11-08-T-005,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I thank the Minister for the reply. It is also good to hear that some of these protections for retail consumers will be progressively rolled out from 2023. I just have one supplementary question and it is whether or not there will be consideration given to better consumer education about the choices that they are facing, in terms of which retailer to go for. I think some of the feedback that we often get is that the various options available, the various contractual options, the lock-in periods, even the rates that we are paying, the differing rates; some consumers can find that quite confusing and I am just wondering whether there will be better consumer education or sharper consumer education, so that the consumers do not think, ""Hey, there are more protections coming in, therefore, there is no risk or lower risk"". Because, as the Minister shared earlier, there is still volatility that we expect in the future. So, whether or not we can start looking at sharpening the consumer education, about the consequences of the choices that they might make.",1,167,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00167

2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"These include  one, requiring retailers to comply with fair contracting practices, such as providing consumers with the consumer advisory and fact sheets to summarise the key terms of their retail plans and consumers must acknowledge such information before signing contracts with the retailers.",3,170,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00170
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The second point, the code of conduct also prohibits retailers from unilaterally terminating contracts with consumers, unless under stipulated conditions – such as if they are exiting the sector, or consumers are insolvent, or had breached the terms of their contract with the retailer.",4,171,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00171
2022-11-08-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"And the third point is that there are safeguards in retailer exits. Exiting retailers are required to refund all security deposits collected from household consumers, after offsetting outstanding charges. Exiting retailers must also approach other retailers to seek their interest and agreement to accept the novation of the contracts on the same terms and conditions before the consumer can be transferred to SP group under the default supply arrangement.",5,172,2022-11-08-T-005-S-00172

2022-11-08-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we thank Ms Denise Phua for her questions and also her comments. Indeed, the skillsets for both the learners and the teachers will have to evolve to meet the demands of the future. As I always share with my colleagues in MOE, teaching today is not just about the transmission of knowledge and learning is not just about the absorption of knowledge. A few things have changed and will continue to change.",1,190,2022-11-08-T-006-S-00190
2022-11-08-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In today's world, knowledge is commoditised. Having knowledge alone is not sufficient; what is more important is the ability to make use of the knowledge to discern and to make clear decisions, good decisions, based on sound values. And, to this end, that is why the skillsets of our teachers must continue to evolve. Beyond just being a transmitter of knowledge, it is increasingly important for our teachers to be able to be a facilitator in the learning environment that our students are in, for our teachers to help our students make sense of the amount of information that they come across.",2,191,2022-11-08-T-006-S-00191

2022-11-08-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Third, we will need our teachers to learn throughout their life to make use of the latest technologies available – how to use technology to scale up the size of the classroom so that we can spend more time to attend to the high needs students. Such technologies include the adaptive learning technologies that allow us to stretch the abilities of the high performing students while allowing us to dedicate more time to the high-needs students. So, these are the new skillsets that we will require our teachers to constantly evolve.",7,196,2022-11-08-T-006-S-00196
2022-11-08-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But having said that, we do not believe that we will be able to frontload all these new skillsets even or only when they are at NIE.

2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, my reply will also address questions that had been raised by Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman in an earlier Sitting, and also by Mr Saktiandi Supaat",1,206,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00206
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, in deciding on changes in public transport fares, the Public Transport Council (PTC) aims for fares to keep up with costs increases over time whilst ensuring affordability. The fare formula, therefore, incorporates component indices, such as core inflation, wage growth and energy prices, which reflect the cost drivers of providing public transport services. The output of the fare formula establishes the fare increase cap for a given year. PTC then considers various other factors before deciding on the actual fare increase to implement and, consequently, how much to carry over to future Fare Review Exercises (FREs).",2,207,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00207
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"PTC considers overall economic growth, wage growth, unemployment rate and other metrics that reflect the state of Singapore's economy at the time of each FRE.",3,208,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00208
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"PTC also seeks to ensure that public transport, as an essential service, remains affordable to all Singaporeans. As wages have risen over the past decade, households have been spending a lower proportion of their income on public transport. For the second decile of households, which essentially represents lower-income public transport users, this has fallen from 3.5% in 2012 to 2.5% in 2021. For the second quintile, which represents average public transport users, that figure has also fallen from 2.3% to 1.8%.",4,209,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00209
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In this year's FRE, the fare formula output set the maximum allowable fare adjustment at 13.5%. One main contributory factor was the 117% increase in energy prices. PTC decided to implement a lower increase of 2.9% after considering the economic and social impact on commuters. The remaining 10.6% will be carried over to future FREs. Meanwhile, the Government will provide additional subsidies of about $200 million in the coming year to make up for the shortfall. This benefits all commuters as it defrays the overall fare increase. To reiterate, without this additional support, commuters would have had to pay a much higher fare increase of 13.5%.",5,210,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00210
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"At each FRE, PTC will also consider both the carry-over from previous FREs, as well as that year's fare formula output. So, for example, in 2021, the formula output was -2.2%, in other words, a reduction, but there was a carry-over amount of 4.4% and, therefore, the increase that was implemented was 2.2%. Apart from the 10.6% carried over from this year, all other carried-over amounts have been implemented.",6,211,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00211
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Over the past decade, we have enhanced the quality of our public transport system, with a larger network, higher frequencies and more reliable services. Despite this, fares have not kept up with costs of running the public transport system. From 2012 to 2021, the compounded increase in costs has been about 7%. Fares have been increasing over the same period at about 1% a year.",7,212,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00212
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the Government has stepped up with funding to bridge the gap and ensure the continued operation of public transport services. The cumulative sum is now more than $2 billion a year, with the additional subsidy of about $200 million in the coming year.",8,213,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00213
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Gerald Giam has asked whether PTC decides on fare adjustments based on bus service reliability. We have made steady improvements over the past decade, with maximum scheduled frequencies during peak periods falling from 30 minutes to 15 minutes today. In terms of Excess Wait Time (EWT) and On-Time Adherence (OTA) scores between 2018 and 2022, all services have met the required standards, and this includes service 228, which, I know, is close to Mr Gerald Giam's heart.",9,214,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00214
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Looking ahead, it is essential that public transport fares keep pace with cost increases. Otherwise, the public transport system will become financially unsustainable and that will be to the detriment of commuters and taxpayers. When PTC reviews fares, it will continue to ensure that any increases are subject to prevailing economic and social considerations.",10,215,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00215
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, let me reassure Members that we are fully committed to ensuring that public transport fares remain affordable, even as we keep a keen eye on the financial sustainability of our public transport system. Today, seniors, students, lower-wage workers and persons with disabilities are eligible for concession fares and increases in their fares are typically less than that for adult commuters. The Government has also made available Public Transport Vouchers (PTVs) to cushion the impact of fare increases for eligible households. For this year's FRE, these vouchers will help up to the 30th percentile of income-earning households, or the 40th percentile of all resident households. And we will continue to address the needs of vulnerable commuters through the provision of PTVs and other measures as necessary.",11,216,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00216
2022-11-08-T-007,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.,1,217,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00217
2022-11-08-T-007,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Thank you. I thank the Minister for his reply. Indeed, bus service 228 is very close to my heart and, more importantly, close to the hearts of my residents in Bedok Reservoir.",1,218,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00218
2022-11-08-T-007,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I would like to clarify with the Minister what he deems to be an acceptable interval between feeder buses, because he says that all the services, including bus service 228, have met the standard. What is really the interval, because I just checked the bus stop opposite Block 716 in Bedok Reservoir Road and it shows an interval of seven to 15 minutes, which I would think that it is a bit long because, previously, residents had several other buses to be able to get to Bedok Interchange from their houses. But now, they have only one bus. So, they depend on that bus and the low interval of that bus.",2,219,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00219
2022-11-08-T-007,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, can the Ministry look into reducing the headways further because this will go a long way in terms of improving the commuter experience of many commuters?",3,220,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00220
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. I note that his questions are very specific, and actually quite a deviation from public transport fares themselves.",1,221,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00221
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Nevertheless, first, what constitutes an acceptable interval? I think it is very hard to give a universally applicable answer. The reason is because the same bus service, or the time of day, there will be variations because of traffic conditions, such as peak, off-peak. Peak periods, you try to keep the headway shorter because of the needs. But off-peak, you allow for more.",2,222,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00222
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, there will always be a range and that also applies to geographic distribution. What we try to do is – because, specifically, the Member's point is on buses – bus contracts spell out clearly the performance requirements and we hold the public transport operators (PTOs) who are awarded the contracts closely to the delivery of those key performance indicators (KPIs). There are incentives and disincentives that apply when they deviate. And, of course, if the deviations are systematic or problematic, then we take further action in that regard.",3,223,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00223
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, can we reduce headways? Well, this is basically re-canvassing the discussions we have had at the Budget and many other occasions, and I compliment the Member on his consistency in raising the issue. But the bottom line is this  every decision has an accompanying cost implication. I notice the Member has not commented on the 2.9% increase. So, I assume the Member finds it acceptable. But bear in mind that this comes with a significant subsidy from the Government, on top of what we are already doing for this year. Every time we reduce headways, it means you either have to have more buses and, therefore, you also need more bus captains, costs will go up and we have to find ways to address this.",4,224,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00224
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"This is not a theoretical argument either, because over the years, if you look at it, in terms of rail reliability – mean kilometres between failures – we have actually made significant improvements because the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has specified an outcome. But that is a number. To achieve that number or exceed it, then the PTOs have to invest significant resources on maintenance. That has a cost implication. We have added, I think, about 80-odd new bus services. That has a cost implication.",5,225,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00225
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, when we advocate, sure, I think we would all like to have shorter headways, more capacity and so on. But I just want to make the point that even as we consider this, we also have to take into account the cost implications and, as this year's exercise demonstrates, there is a major cost overhang that we are carrying, and we are carrying this as a Government, as representatives of the people.",6,226,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00226

2022-11-08-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The supplementary question I am going to ask is in relation to the gap that the Minister mentioned. There is a 7% increase in the cost of transport expenditure and infrastructure itself, as the Minister mentioned before. Also just now, the Minister mentioned about the 1% transport price increase annually. So, there is this gap of about 6%. Whether this gap is sustainable is one question that I have, and will the Government subsidies eventually stop?",1,228,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00228
2022-11-08-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second supplementary question is in relation to the PTVs. Can I ask if, eventually, these PTVs can be permanent or enhanced even further and made automatic in future Budgets?",2,229,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00229
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I am conscious of the time and I want to make sure I meet the on-time arrival KPI. But let me address the questions very quickly with your indulgence, Sir.",1,230,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00230
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, is the gap sustainable? As I have pointed out, that is precisely the issue because our costs have been rising and our fares have not been anyway near that rate. There is a fare formula review exercise that is underway. I think we will need to take a hard look at this and that is what the PTC is working on – what exactly is the way forward for us. And this is not just about the sums, but it really comes down to an overall discussion on the compact that we expect. And fare formula and fare adjustments are not just about the current generation because everything we do not pay now, as we discussed in other debates, also has an impact on future generations. So, we need to keep that in mind.",2,231,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00231
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, therefore, the implication for Government subsidies? Well, the Government has stepped up and has clearly put in a significant amount – $2 billion, and another $200 million for next year. What we do going forward, will again, be a matter of discussion that we will have to also address in this House as part of our larger policy with respect to public transport.",3,232,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00232
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, can PTVs be made a permanent feature? I suspect that question is best addressed by the Minister for Finance. But I would argue that from our perspective – and I want to reiterate the point – we are committed to making sure fares are affordable, especially for vulnerable commuters. That includes not just in the way we address fare increase adjustments and the discounts for what we can do and, also through the concession passes, but it is also through PTVs.",4,233,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00233
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As Members would have noticed, this year and, also in the previous exercise, there has been a very significant allocation for PTVs – up to the 30th percentile of income-earning households. I think that is a major provision and we will continue to see what else needs to be done in that regard.",5,234,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00234
2022-11-08-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I suppose permanent PTVs could be one of the possibilities, but I think that we should just see through this exercise first.",6,235,2022-11-08-T-007-S-00235

2022-11-08-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, given that the allowances are meant to reduce the ""near-term impact"" on business competitiveness, why does the Bill set no end date for such allowances to be granted?

There is no reason these names should be a secret. They are clearly not a matter of commercial sensitivity and companies that do not receive such allowances will rightly wonder whether the Government is secretly granting allowances to their rivals in the same sector.

2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"On this note, I would like to ask the Government to expand on the considerations that will come into play in awarding allowances in more detail, a topic treated briefly in section 20D of the Bill.",22,340,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00340

2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, this is so as to demonstrate our ambition and seriousness in the face of such a major challenge as climate change; to demonstrate the political will to keep allowances to the bare minimum, so as to generate a strong nudge on business.",25,343,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00343
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, this is so as to foster confidence among companies themselves that the carbon tax regime and, indeed, our entire business environment, are fair and transparent. This is necessary as the carbon tax is a significant burden applicable to firms and also the wider public. Imposing this burden comes with a responsibility to ensure that the public and business community see that the burden will be imposed fairly; and exceptions made on a very limited, transparent basis with strong reasons given, as opposed to a perception that allowances are awarded to companies close to any future government for one reason or another, for example. Only then will we obtain a wider buy-in to the carbon tax regime from citizens and the business community that we need.",26,344,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00344

2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Okay. Our amendment (3) in the Order Paper Supplement tackles this problem of having non-time-limited allowances that are not really as circumscribed in scope as they could be, by limiting the number of times a taxable facility can receive allowances. Assuming that businesses are able to get allowances when they ask for it, our amendment would mean – to take an example – that a facility can obtain allowances in the following years  2024, 2025, and, if still deemed necessary after a gap, 2029 and 2030, with 2026, 2027 and 2028 being no allowance years. This still leaves a substantial runway for companies to transform to low-emission processes and sources from now until 2026; and leeway for the Government to apply an allowance in 2029 for particularly large and strategic projects, if deemed necessary.",1,348,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00348

In other words, our amendment sets up a cap of 33%, because the tax charged must not be less than double the awarded allowance. We believe that lowering the allowance cap makes for a stronger nudge for large emitters to move towards greener business models faster. We believe that our amendment makes for a better balance point between the competing objectives on the table here.",3,350,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00350

2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"A carbon tax allowance is a reduction in tax applied to one entity, versus all similar entities which have to pay that tax. Hence, it is a lessening of a burden applied to all in the case of one. An economic incentive, on the other hand, gives additional benefits to one company that all do not receive. The difference between the two scenarios is that in the first case, a new tax being imposed means new costs to all. If one entity has their cost lessened, to obtain general buy-in for the tax among all companies and the public, a certain degree of transparency and public accountability is warranted for the new regime to be seen as fair.",15,362,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00362
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Moreover, given that the carbon tax imposes costs across the whole society and an allowance blunts the effect of that tax to some degree, there is a public interest in knowing who receives such awards, to ensure accountability vis-à-vis the goals of the carbon tax. This helps ensure that any government of the day does not prop up certain companies for an unjustifiably long period of time, or even in perpetuity, for whatever reason. This ensures public support for a costly tax that is meant to be, in the words of the Government spoken in this House in 2021, a ""fair, uniform and transparent price signal"" that advances climate change goals; or, to quote the Government's words again in 2018, to create a carbon tax regime that ""will apply uniformly to all sectors, without exemption.

We must not forget that we all share the same earth. While we are determined to stick to our environmental protection commitments, we cannot be sure others will do likewise. There remains a possibility that other countries will continue to resort to the easy way out, in order to make themselves more price competitive. This is the reality of the global marketplace.",2,376,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00376
2022-11-08-T-009,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"In view of this, how will the Government help EITE sectors, such as the electronics, chemical and energy industries to remain economically competitive? How will the Ministry ensure that jobs are not lost to jurisdictions with less stringent legislation? If this were to happen, the global carbon emissions will not be reduced despite the loss of local jobs and investments. How will the Government get the largest carbon emitters, such as all the energy producers in the world, to take the lead in becoming more green?",3,377,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00377

2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, I had previously spoken during the Climate Change Motion debated at the start of the year, about the elegant simplicity of a carbon tax, and its importance as an instrument for addressing the global climate emergency. At the time, I explained why the Workers' Party believes that an emissions price of $15 per tonne – targeted by the existing CPA for 2030 – would be inadequate, and why a tax ranging between $58 and $133 would be more tenable, with $100 a ton being a reasonably close-to-median and scientifically-supported benchmark.",1,381,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00381
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While the Government has declined to come as far as we have advocated, the proposed amendments to the CPA of 2018 provides for increases to the carbon price and carbon tax rate, which the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) has indicated, will now be in the order of between $50 and $80 per tonne by 2030. While we continue to believe that the appropriate level should be higher, we view this as an important compromise.",2,382,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00382

2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Because I am all about practice and not just theory, I wish to speak about transition issues associated with the practical implementation of a carbon tax; in effect, aspects surrounding the amended Third Schedule of the Bill. The Schedule currently proposes an increase of the carbon tax, from $5 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions up till 2023, to $25 in 2024 and 2025, and to $45 from 2026 onward. Presumably, there will be subsequent legislation after 2027 to conform with the stated $50 to $80 target.",4,384,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00384

2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"It is easy to recognise the appeal of a steady increase in the carbon tax  it is gradual, predictable and incremental, thereby affording businesses time and certainty as they adapt to an impending tax increase. But its unyielding nature may also be its undoing.",6,386,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00386
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"After all, the increase in carbon taxes to the proposed range is fairly sharp  in just three years, the rate will be one order of magnitude greater than the $5 a tonne currently in place. Such a significant hike may also appear to be ill-timed, with our economy just exiting a relatively recent technical recession in 2020 and currently struggling to manage global pressures from rising inflation.",7,387,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00387
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"There is, however, an alternative  allow the carbon tax to vary over time, with the specific rate adapted to the current prevailing state of the economy. Following standard principles of stabilisation policy, such an optimal tax would strike a balance between safeguarding the economy and jobs, while protecting the environment. If the economy is in a recession, God forbid, the tax would be scaled back. In contrast, if the economy is expanding strongly, it should be able to bear a stiffer increase in the carbon tax rate.",8,388,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00388
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Of course, accurately calling the state of the economy in real time is admittedly a challenge. But modern macroeconomics, along with access to big data, has already made substantial progress on this front, and it is now possible to reasonably gauge where we stand in the business cycle. In addition, modern central banks routinely gauge the extent to which the economy has deviated from its steady state. The European Central Bank, for instance, adjusts member states' budget balances to reflect the contemporary state of the economy. I would be shocked if the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not have its own in-house team that performs this very exercise.",9,389,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00389
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Using this approach, the tax would adhere to a central rate outlined in the Third Schedule but be up- or down-weighted by the MAS' evaluation of the current state of the economy. For example, if we find ourselves sliding into a recession next year, the $25 rate could drop to $15 or $20, depending on the severity of the contraction, whereas it could rise to $30 or $35 as the economy rebounds.",10,390,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00390
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Does this proposal undermine the case that other taxes, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), should not be raised at this point of the cycle? Not quite. If anything, the notion of tax policy being sensitive to the state of the economy is entirely consistent with the argument that an increase in the GST next year is also inappropriate.",11,391,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00391
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The basic principle is that carbon taxes – like all taxes – should be higher when the economy is growing steadily and lower otherwise.  But the reason why I had previously argued for a temporary freeze in GST hikes despite the economy presently growing steadily is because other policy levers – in particular, monetary and exchange rate policy, are already acting counter-cyclically. This implies that the role of fiscal policy should be limited to serving as a moderating ballast. Moreover, we should keep in mind that, unlike carbon taxes which applies to only goods and services that involve carbon in their production and hence, has a narrower impact, the GST is a broad-based tax, which affects nearly all supplies of goods and services. The impact that rising carbon taxes would have on the economy would have correspondingly a more limited scope.",12,392,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00392
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"This notion is corroborated by the data. A study that examines the macroeconomic implications of a carbon tax in Europe finds that there is no evidence to support the view that such taxes are job or growth killers. Another that explores whether carbon pricing on inflation, finds that it likewise does not.",13,393,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00393
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Incidentally, such a time-varying carbon tax need not apply only to this particular transition period. If the Government subscribes to the general principle that a time-varying carbon tax is attractive, the rate can be adjusted every time the Singapore economy experiences an economic weakness and vice versa.",14,394,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00394
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Beyond the instruments of fiscal policy – for which carbon taxation is a part – the Government can also attempt to realign monetary policy toward favouring green initiatives, too. This means that MAS can assist our transition process in its move toward net zero.",15,395,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00395

2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),The MAS chief Ravi Menon has also explained how the MAS is supporting the development of a transition taxonomy – both at home and abroad – and spearheaded a host of other Enterprise Singapore (ESG) initiatives.,17,397,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00397
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"That said, the MAS has mostly been engaged in these initiatives as either a convener or a coordinator, under its financial development mandate. My suggestion is that it can affect the transition process even more directly, by embedding green considerations into its day-to-day operations. For example, MAS can target its open market operations toward green bonds. While the amount of tradable green bonds may be limited, consciously including green bonds in its potential portfolio of securities that it buys and sells when it conducts monetary policy, can assist us in this transition process.",18,398,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00398
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Another way that the Government can support the green transition via financial development is to establish an Export Import (EXIM) Bank. This has been a core plank of the Workers' Party manifesto and is premised on the importance of offering financing to pursue internationalisation and digitalisation objectives for, especially, our small and medium enterprises (SMEs). To this, we can now add support for the green transition for SMEs to this list of objectives for a potential EXIM bank.",19,399,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00399

While I understand such reservations, it is useful to understand why the Workers' Party, along with, in fact, the MTI's own Economic Strategies Committee have called for such a bank.",20,400,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00400
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Export-import banks, along with export credit agencies, finance cross-border projects that the private sector would otherwise shun. Typically, these are projects that display substantial externalities, which are the costs or benefits that private agents either do not, or cannot, adequately factor into their own private decision-making. Such externalities include the risks of political upheaval, or propensity default on loans, or social benefits. Alternatively, projects may only be profitable at such a large scale that it is impossible for any single lender to achieve this scale.",21,401,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00401
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Green projects, especially in infrastructure, satisfy both criteria, making an EXIM bank ideally positioned to fund them. Existing financing schemes, such as ESG trade loan facilities, credit guarantees, or political risk insurance schemes, do not adequately meet these needs, since they may not garner sufficient financial scale, or entail externalities that simply are not insurable. EXIM banks have also proven their mettle in times of crisis, preventing complete collapses in trade finance markets.",22,402,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00402
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"EXIM banks are, therefore, well suited to support green transition objectives. In fact, many green financing needs, such access to green energy sources, or carbon credit exchanges, are already inherently cross-border in nature. Consequently, the trade financing and international financial access portfolios of an EXIM bank could easily be expanded to enfold sustainability objectives. And indeed, the number of other EXIM banks, such as those in China, India, Hungary and Thailand, have successfully rolled out green on-lending facilities.",23,403,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00403

As challenging as this may be, there is no reason why we should not ease the process as much as we possibly can.

This means that the percentage could be increased to more than 5% if the Minister permits. Allowing facilities to use ICCs for a sizeable portion of their emissions may mean that facilities end up having less incentive to cut down on taxable emissions, as they do not have to pay tax on that portion of emissions.",8,431,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00431
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Many Members in this House have spoken on the regime's allowing the surrendering of up to 5% of their taxable emissions and in particular, my Sengkang colleague, Mr Louis Chua during this year's Committee of Supply (COS), asked about what accountability measures will be put in place to ensure transparency and fair implementation of this regime.",9,432,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00432
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"This question is still pertinent today. How will the Minister decide when to lift the prescribed limit? Is there a framework to constrain this decision-making process? I have therefore sought to make the amendments, as listing the decisions of the Minister on a public registry will allow both industry players and civil society to observe the use of ICCs over the years and whether particular facilities are over-reliant on the use of ICCs.",10,433,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00433
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"First, the danger of allowing facilities to continuously use ICCs beyond the prescribed limit is that facilities may look to purchase ICCs with low and favourable prices. This could mean that the cost of producing emissions is significantly less than the cost of paying tax on emissions, which creates a disconnect between the purposes of carbon tax and the permitted use of ICCs. Instead of being compelled by the prevailing carbon tax to cut down their emissions, the entity-owning facilities may turn their efforts to purchasing favourable ICCs instead.",11,434,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00434
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The problem is exacerbated by how different ICCs may have different criteria for pricing credits. The value of credits also changes through rounds of trading between entities. The worth of each credit in a different ICC framework, and at different time periods, is different. And the entity-owning facilities can exploit these differences to obtain credits that give them the greatest financial advantage. This defeats the purpose of having a fixed carbon tax that has carefully calibrated increases over the years to discourage emissions and, in particular, to make emissions increasing expensive over time.",12,435,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00435
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Second, having the public registry listing the Minister's decisions will also be a first step in examining whether the use of ICCs indeed fits its purpose of allowing facilities some leeway in producing emissions only in the near to medium term. If facilities continue to surrender ICCs for many years beyond the prescribed limit, this indicates that they may not have found a way to reduce emissions adequately to avoid paying carbon tax excessively.",13,436,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00436
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Third, requiring the Minister to state their reasons for granting permission to surrender ICCs beyond the prescribed limit ensures that we are told the reasons for such decisions upfront, reducing the need for unhelpful speculation or even false rumours to take bed. It can also give comfort that the Minister has indeed carefully considered the issue of the surrender of ICCs and respect of each facility.",14,437,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00437
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Note, too, that I have not, in the amendment, asked for a disclosure of the amount surrendered as we recognise the commercial sensitivities surrounding this information, particularly in the market environment that is that is still finding its feet, so to speak.",15,438,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00438
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Finally, my proposed amendment is also aligned with the Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative's Claims Code of Practice, which calls for the transparent reporting of information. The Code of Practice states that companies must disclose how carbon credits are used towards their climate targets, including ""whether or not the current credit is associated with corresponding adjustments by the host and/or by a country"".",16,439,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00439
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"In addition, I would like to seek clarification on the quality and eligibility of carbon credits. I understand that NEA has signed separate MOUs with Verra and Gold Standard to support Singapore-based companies in using eligible carbon credits issued by Verra and Gold Standard to meet part of their carbon tax obligations in Singapore.",17,440,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00440
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"However, there is little further information on the criteria for eligible credits and the ability to verify the carbon-lowering activities of such ICCs is key. Could the Minister let us know when we can expect further details on the prescribed criteria as set out in clause 33A and how are these criteria being formulated?",18,441,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00441
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"It is also precisely because the market for ICCs is still new and highly unstandardised that makes it difficult to quantify, and therefore, their use can be controversial. Indeed, academics and environmental groups are concerned that the use of carbon credits could hinder, delay or even displace environmental efforts.",19,442,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00442
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Key aspects of ICCs have not yet been standardised and robust verification mechanisms have not been developed to be applied uniformly across various markets, unlike in the case of commodities, for example, which are traded using industry-specific standardised contracts.",20,443,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00443
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The under-regulation of carbon markets also means that there is a risk for greenwashing, a topic which I will come back to later.",21,444,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00444
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"If carbon credits themselves are not rigorously regulated, it may end up hindering emissions reductions by reducing the pressure on regulators and thus, businesses, to aggressively commit to investing in cleaner technologies and to move away from high emissions activities.",22,445,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00445
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"There is also concern that there have been consistent over-estimations of emissions reductions in the past. Studies conducted on two of the world's largest offset programmes, which are both administered by the United Nations under the Kyoto Protocol – the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint implementation (JI) – have found approximately 60% to 70% of their offset credits may not represent valid emissions reductions.",23,446,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00446
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Adding to the mix is the difficulty in proving a counterfactual – that is, it is hard to prove that offset programmes made something happen that would not otherwise have happened, regardless of the programme's existence. This is often referred to as ""additionality"".",24,447,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00447
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Yet, in spite all of these, the ICCs continue to have a role to play during the intervening years of our green transition. Limitations of today's technologies mean that hard-to-abate sectors still find it difficult to eliminate emissions. While costs may drop as we continue to work on better and cheaper technology solutions, high-quality ICCs are a way for businesses to plug the gap in the meantime. Our emissions reduction pathway to the 1.5-degree warming target still requires carbon offsets to play a role.",25,448,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00448
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Because of the above reasons, ICCs cannot be the only tool in our market's toolkit to facilitate the green transition. Some of the lessons learnt and concerns from the green and sustainability financial markets are also useful when we look at ICCs. I shall now turn to them.",26,449,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00449
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I note that closer to home, MAS has been making efforts to grow the size of the market here in Singapore and to improve both accessibility to SMEs, and also to maintain an eye on sustainability credentials. Initiatives, such as the Green and Sustainability-Linked Loan Grant Scheme (GSLS) and Project Greenprint aim to do just that, and we have also seen that the local green bond market has grown from S$1 billion five years ago to S$14.4 billion last year. The amount of green loans to has grown from S$2.9 billion in 2018 to S$17 billion last year.",27,450,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00450
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Green financing and the development of robust and large financial markets for green instruments play a very important role to support enterprises and economies towards a decarbonised future. Various financial institutions have been active in developing these markets and various banks have committed to contributing large amounts to sustainable financing and investment by 2030. This is, in itself, a good thing.",28,451,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00451
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Green instruments, like sustainability linked bonds, or SLBs, are ways in which businesses can get access to financing for investment and other activities, which are ostensibly for the purpose of transitioning to more sustainable activities. However, the nature of the market at the moment means that companies, the borrowers, pay experts and consultancies should set appropriate sustainability targets and to evaluate these during the course of the bond, to check whether these targets are being met. Lenders or arrangers, too, would like to be able to announce that they have a large amount of green loans or bonds on their books. In fact, all three parties benefit by being able to tell their involvement in green financing deals. This leaves a question about whether there is sufficient pressure and whether there is enough independent oversight be exercised to lower the risk of greenwashing.",29,452,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00452
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Compounding the problem is that the structure of these green instruments may not have enough negative incentives to make issuers do all they can to meet the sustainability targets set. For sustainability-linked bonds, in particular, the funds are not ring-fenced, making them vulnerable to greenwashing and allows financing to continue to be used by issuers to fund carbon-intensive expenses and projects. More generally, penalties by way of bumps of less than 100 basis points in the amount of increased interest payable is paltry, especially if these are percentages agreed to by the companies themselves, and often represent amounts that are tiny fractions, that work out to be far under 1% of the annual revenue of these issuers.",30,453,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00453
2022-11-08-T-009,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"And while it is true that there are attempts to create standards for sustainability and green targets that issuers and borrowers are expected to meet, such attempts are often voluntary in nature, like the International Capital Market Association (ICMA)'s Green Bond Principles and Sustainability-linked Bond Principles, and they do not address the lack of common disclosure frameworks for each asset class of green instruments and the technical nature of the green or sustainability data points themselves make it open to uncertainty.",31,454,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00454

My colleague from Sengkang, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, earlier mentioned how an EXIM bank can play its role in developing green financial markets. I would like to take that one step further by repeating our calls to ask for an EXIM bank to be directly involved in financing green loans and arranging green and sustainability-linked bonds for our enterprises, with a view to using the rich trove of data available from this to either fine-tune existing taxonomies or develop a set of robust and internationally-acceptable set of standards for green financing, which we would then export to the rest of the region and world for wider adoption.",34,457,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00457

I would like to know how the Government sets the amount of allowance for these large emitters.

If they are already complying, are we not subsidising them by providing them with allowance? Will these large emitters be prescribed a timeline to decarbonise?

I agree with him. We need MAS to incentivise and guide the financial institutions to provide transition finance to these large emitters which will try its best to nullify its GHG emissions. We need ESG to provide more assistance to SMEs so that they know how to measure emissions. And we should look to MAS to lead a regional effort to support a just transition and decarbonisation not just in Singapore, but in the region.

Across all scenarios considered by the IPCC, global temperatures will continue to increase until at least the mid-century. In fact, we are now expected to reach this 1.5 degree celsius tipping point 10 years earlier than expected. To limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius with no or limited overshoot, net global CO2 emissions need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

2022-11-08-T-009,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),My first point is on the carbon tax. The Bill proposes an increase in carbon pricing from the current $5 a tonne to $45 a tonne from 2026 to 2027.

2022-11-08-T-009,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Next, I will touch on the industry transition framework. The Workers' Party believes in the principle of allowances, and this will be important to ease the transition for both carbon emitters and for individual Singaporeans, such as in the context of a higher carbon tax on power prices. This transition framework could mitigate the impact of higher carbon taxes, such as by giving companies in EITE sectors more time to invest in cleaner technologies.",9,504,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00504

The introduction of allowances goes against the spirit of the Government's previous commitment to apply the carbon tax uniformly to all sectors, including energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors, without exemption. This is why we are proposing that the Government publicly disclose which facilities are receiving allowances, and for which emission years.",10,505,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00505

However, such a framework could be seen by some that the Government is overly protective of these industries in the face of the existential threat of climate change and with many of these very same companies keen to decarbonise themselves! Shell and BP, for example, have set net-zero commitments by 2050.",11,506,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00506

2022-11-08-T-009,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"However, clause 33B of the Bill currently provides an exception where the Minister may ""permit eligible international carbon credits to be surrendered in excess of the prescribed limit in any particular case or class of cases"".

2022-11-08-T-009,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on the recent US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). I shared in my previous speech about how in 1961, Shell built an oil refinery on Pulau Bukom, and this became one of the largest refinery complexes globally and sparked the start of Singapore's pursuit of the petrochemicals industry. In the same way, clean energy and green finance can be our next growth sector. The US appears to be leading the way with its recent IRA, which directs significant funding for climate efforts through a mix of tax incentives, grants and loan guarantees, and is set to be funded by prescription drug pricing reform and a 15% corporate minimum tax among others.",15,510,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00510

While the reduction in 2030 target emissions of 60 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent from 65 million tonnes is definitely welcomed, does it mean that we will still reach 65 million tonnes of CO2 or higher ahead of previous forecasts, even as we set a lower 2030 emissions target?",20,515,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00515

As part of the Bill amendment, there will be a transition framework to support companies to move to low-carbon operations. Most of the companies in the affected industries, large emitters especially, are already working on decarbonisation and many have pledged to get to net zero by 2050 or thereabout. Many of these companies, being MNCs, probably have already applied a shadow carbon price or an internal carbon price for their own projects and, therefore, understand and support the need for a meaningful carbon tax in Singapore in order to motivate industry to reduce emission.",6,524,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00524

2022-11-08-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Let me first touch on emission allowances. Industry players believe that there is a need for a differentiated emission allowance, both in terms of amount and timing, taking into account the specific industry and organisation's decarbonisation plans to achieve low-carbon operations. There is a thinking that carbon tax pricing should be based on the principle that it is pegged close to the abatement cost, so as to motivate the industry to implement abatement without losing competitiveness.",8,526,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00526
2022-11-08-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Next, the industry hopes that the transition framework will consider technology allowances, since countries and industries are all relying on future technologies such as carbon capture and utilisation and storage (CCUS), green hydrogen or nuclear just to name a few. These technologies are immature and are still in development. With current technologies, there will still be remnants of carbon remaining and the tax amount can be significant. I am given to believe that current technology is at best 90% efficient, and power and natural gas are still required for burn abatement. Industry believes that this carbon should be ""forgiven"" or returned as allowances for the industry to invest into technology development to achieve zero carbon. Maybe the allowances might even be pooled together to accelerate the development of the future technologies at a macro level.",9,527,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00527
2022-11-08-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The third issue concerns indirect carbon tax from electricity. Singapore power rate is amongst the highest across countries. The proposed carbon tax potentially increases power rates further, and industry has no control over it. Companies think that they should not be penalised from the lack of green energy in Singapore. Current plans have Singapore importing four gigawatts of low-carbon electricity only by 2035. Industry hopes that further allowance be factored into the transition framework while Singapore is building its green energy infrastructure, and carbon tax resulting from the lack of green energy, should not pass through to industry during this period.",10,528,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00528

From the Budget announcement, companies will have the option to use eligible ICCs in lieu of paying carbon tax for up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 2024 onwards. The industry feels that this 5% of taxable emission is rather insufficient. A company with high abatement solution will achieve maximum 90% emission reduction limited by the existing technology. For such a company, only 5% of the remaining 10% can be offset using carbon credit.

2022-11-08-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"The proposed amendments to the CPA are a positive step in the right direction and I stand in support of the Bill. I would, however, like to clarify the following points.",2,548,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00548
2022-11-08-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"The carbon price is proposed to increase five times to $25 per tonne of emissions by 2024 and $45 by 2026. According to the World Bank's State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2022, this would mean that Singapore would lead Asia in carbon prices. I would like to ask what this would mean to companies that are eligible to be taxed, in terms of Singapore's competitiveness as a destination to set up operations.",3,549,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00549
2022-11-08-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"In addition, with the significant increases in carbon tax, I would like to ask the Minister what the plans are for these additional revenues. One suggestion would be to allocate some of these to research and development (R&D) programmes related to green energy and sustainability, or education programmes to prepare companies for carbon tax reporting. I understand that there are programmes already in place to incentivise and support environmental sustainability. I would like to ask the Minister what the take-up rate of these grants are and how we can increase the utilisation of such grants.",4,550,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00550
2022-11-08-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"I am also concerned about how the increase in carbon prices will impact the daily living costs in Singapore and what are the Government's plans to ensure that energy prices remain stable. I recognise that there are opportunities for Singapore to pivot importing renewable energy from nearby countries; however, this would increase the reliance from overseas sources and affect our energy security.",5,551,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00551
2022-11-08-T-009,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member),"Lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like to reiterate my firm support of the Bill. It reinforces Singapore's commitment to a net-zero emissions country by 2050 and forces us to find solutions to demonstrate competitiveness in a low-carbon future.",6,552,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00552

2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite apt that after a long debate yesterday on the GST increase – whether it is necessary, and whether it is the right timing to do this next year and in 2024 – we are debating today about a higher carbon tax, from 2024 onwards.",1,554,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00554
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Just as we need a higher GST to help fund the healthcare needs of a population that is ageing surely and quickly with every passing day, we need a right price signal for carbon across the whole of our economy and our society, in a world that is heading quickly towards temperatures that are 1.5 to 2 degree celsius above pre-industrial levels, a world in which extreme weather has become more and more real for more and more people.",2,555,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00555
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Climate change is an existential threat, so we need the right price signal for carbon in Singapore urgently to drive the necessary changes in behaviour, by both individual consumers and businesses and producers.",3,556,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00556
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Singapore introduced the carbon tax in 2019 at a nominal $5 per tonne of CO2 emission to help the whole of our society transit and adjust. Three years on, there is an urgent need to do more, to ensure that ""the price is right"" – that the price signal for carbon is right. Yet, this could not have come at a more challenging time.",4,557,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00557
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"In what Senior Minister Tharman has described as a ""perfect long storm"", climate change is converging with other structural fragilities, like rising interest rates and inflation. And the need to bear a higher but right cost of carbon – now – is competing with very real concerns about costs of living, concerns that are immediate and real.",5,558,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00558
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Of course, in the medium term, by the end of a few years, we hope that individuals' consumption patterns would have changed and businesses would be well on their way to transit to low-carbon business models and practices, and the cost impact of carbon to both individuals and businesses and across the whole economy would have reached a new equilibrium, plateau, or even come down.",6,559,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00559
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"But there is no avoiding that we are raising carbon tax soon in the eye of this ""perfect long storm"" and a cost impact – higher costs – now and in the near term is almost unavoidable, coinciding with a period in which costs of living are sharply rising.",7,560,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00560
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),Electricity prices will go up because of the higher price of carbon. Public transport costs will likely go up too.,8,561,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00561
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"So, I like to ask and seek clarification on how does the Government plan to help Singaporeans cope with and adjust to this new normal of low carbon? How do we cushion the impact – and for which groups – yet maintain the integrity of the price signal of carbon across the whole of society and bring all segments in our society along in this journey towards a low-carbon future?",9,562,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00562
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"It is heartening to hear the Government's commitment to use part of the carbon tax revenues to help Singaporeans cushion the impact, by way of, for example, more utilities rebates and public transport vouchers (PTVs), but can the Government share more of its thinking about how it plans to deploy this, for whom, how much and what would be its guiding principles and key considerations as it moves ahead in this direction?",10,563,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00563
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Beyond the impact on costs of living, another very real concern of a higher carbon tax is the potential impact on Singapore's economic competitiveness, especially for traditionally emission-intensive trade-exposed industries.",11,564,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00564
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Singapore was the first to introduce a carbon tax in the region. And in very short order, Singapore will have the highest carbon tax in the region. How do we make sure we remain competitive in the region and that whole industries, like petrochemicals and electronics, do not lift and shift out of Singapore?",12,565,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00565
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"How do we ensure that Singaporeans can continue to look forward to good jobs in these industries in a low-carbon future? Can the Government share more details about how it plans to work with industry to build new capabilities, and indeed, turn this strategic challenge into new and exciting opportunities for Singapore and Singaporeans?",13,566,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00566
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Indeed, traditionally, emission-intensive industries can, and must, become a part of our future green economy.",14,567,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00567
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And while the competition may be regional, markets for these emission-intensive trade-exposed industries are, in fact, global. And these markets will lead and define the demand for low-carbon products and services in the future.",15,568,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00568
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And so, we have an opportunity in Singapore to build future green capabilities for the world, position Singapore as a global hub to leapfrog the status quo and help the world produce green products and services.",16,569,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00569
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"How might we better communicate this vision to all Singaporeans and make all of us part of this journey to turn the carbon constraint into exciting opportunities, and to turn the low-carbon challenge into a whole new world of possibilities in the next chapter of our Singapore Story, just as we have done for water, gas and land, in the Singapore Story thus far.",17,570,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00570
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Sir, before I conclude, I would also just like to make a quick response to Member Mr Louis Chua's suggestion just now, if I heard him correctly, he was suggesting a US$100 carbon tax. I would just like to ask if he has considered the impact of this proposal on both cost of living and economic competitiveness, as so many of our Members have raised.",18,571,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00571
2022-11-08-T-009,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Sir, in summary, notwithstanding the concerns about cost of living and economic competitiveness, this Bill raises the curtain on exciting opportunities and possibilities for Singapore, and I support the Bill.",19,572,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00572

2022-11-08-T-009,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I like to thank the Member Mr Xie for his question. In terms of the carbon tax rates, I quoted a series of various numbers – by the World Bank, the OECD and various sources, and I think that is also consistent with what some of the feedback that was provided through the MSE consultations. There are views that based on the existing level of carbon taxes that we have proposed, it is actually on the low end of both the scientific recommendations as well as what is proposed by some of these other organisations in their studies.",1,574,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00574
2022-11-08-T-009,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"More importantly, I do recognise and agree with the Member's point in terms of supporting households in this transition and this is something which we have spoken about in the earlier debates as well. In particular, when it comes to supporting households, we have talked about, for example, reducing the impact of higher carbon taxes on households, such as via a green dividend and a green fund. These are mechanisms which can be potentially put in place on top of the various utilities rebates which the Government has also put forth.",2,575,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00575

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Instead of peaking at 65 million tonnes CO2 in 2030, Singapore will step up our efforts to peak earlier and reduce carbon emissions to 60 million tonnes CO2 in 2030.

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"This is a bold announcement, given Singapore's alternative energy disadvantaged position and our absolute dependence on the imported LNG for 95% of our country's electricity generation.",3,579,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00579
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"However, as a responsible member of the international community committed to fight the climate emergency, Singapore's strategic commitment to achieve net zero by 2050 is a necessary undertaking.",4,580,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00580
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"What does Singapore have to do differently in order to meet the net-zero goal?

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"In the short term, we will have to aggressively abate carbon emissions in our economy. Therefore, the carbon tax is an important price signal and also an instrument to nudge industries, to internalise the cost of carbon emissions into their business costs and to adopt low-carbon business practices.",7,583,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00583
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"The Government is cognisant of the cost burden of the carbon tax on businesses and the consequential impact on cost of living that will be passed onto the consumers. Hence, only facilities that produces more than 25,000 kilotonne CO2 emissions annually, will be subjected to the carbon tax.",8,584,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00584
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Also, the carbon tax will be implemented in a progressive manner. It will be increased from $5 per tonne CO2 emissions to $25 next year, and to $45 in 2026. Even the long-term carbon tax of $50 to $80 expected in 2030, will still be considered comparable to the tax rates in other jurisdictions, for example in Europe, where carbon taxes can go beyond $100 per tonne CO2 emissions.",9,585,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00585
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"In general, the business community here is appreciative that the introduction of carbon tax has been gradual, so that there is sufficient response time to prepare for this transition.",10,586,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00586
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"And I am heartened to learn from the Minister that the revenue collected from carbon taxes are not meant for the purposes of deriving additional Government revenue.

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"However, perhaps more could be done to enable this green transition, to help the industries and to achieve better decarbonisation results. I would like to ask the Minister what is the projected revenue from carbon taxes that will be collected annually over the next 10 years? What are the additional decarbonisation programmes, incentives and subsidies that would be implemented to help industries, especially SMEs and large local enterprises (LLEs), transit into the green economy? What is the budget that is set aside for these programmes and incentives?",12,588,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00588

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Clearly, the increase in carbon taxes in 2023 will add greater cost pressures to industries that are already facing the triple whammy of the COVID-19 pandemic, higher energy costs and GST increase next year.",14,590,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00590
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Hence, I agree that the transition framework is a prudent strategy to help the EITE sectors ride out this cost increase wave, so that they can remain competitive against rivals in other jurisdictions that have nil or lower carbon taxes.",15,591,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00591
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Indeed, it will require a fine balance and sound judgement to use the carbon tax as a stick for some industries while for other companies, the carbon tax can be waived to help them with transition. As outlined in section 20D and 20E of the amended Bill, discretionary powers are vested with the Minister for Trade and Industry and appointed public bodies to assess each company's decarbonisation plans and determine if they are eligible for carbon tax exemption.",16,592,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00592
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"On this note, may I ask the Minister if an impact analysis of carbon taxes on the overall business costs of affected companies has been carried out, in particular, for our SMEs and LLEs? Also, how much transition time will companies in the EITE sectors be given before they are subjected to the full-blown effect of the carbon tax increase?",17,593,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00593

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"These companies may be paying both higher electricity tariffs due to the current energy crisis as well as increased carbon taxes for the carbon emissions generated. Otherwise, they may have to purchase renewable energies through private purchase agreements in order to meet carbon targets. Does MTI know the number of companies that will be in such a predicament and how can they be assisted in the energy transition?",19,595,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00595
2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Also, as carbon emissions accounting and ESG standards are still not fully harmonised, are there adequate well-qualified consultants in the market to help companies, especially the SMEs and LLEs, to account for their carbon emissions footprint, to advise them on the sustainability strategies and to project the corresponding carbon taxes? Will these consultants need to be accredited by the Ministry? If so, will there be guidelines on consultancy fees chargeable to prevent companies from being subjected to paying yet another hefty layer of cost?",20,596,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00596

2022-11-08-T-009,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"However, there will be three issues to consider. Firstly, for such high-quality ICCs to become meaningful carbon offsets options for companies, the price points must be comparable with the carbon taxes of $20 per tonne CO2, starting in 2023, and eventually, trending towards being $50 to $80 by 2030. According to the Bloomberg market analysis, under tighter regulations, carbon credit prices may rise 30 times by 2029 to $224 per tonne CO2 before tapering to $120 in 2050. Should such high prices prevail, then ICCs would become irrelevant for businesses as an alternative to paying carbon tax.",25,601,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00601

Singapore is firmly committed to doing our part in the global effort to reduce GHGs emissions. And to meet our climate commitments, we have put in place a robust suite of measures to spur and support our companies to decarbonise.",2,612,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00612
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"The carbon tax forms a key part of this effort. It prices carbon to guide investment decisions by companies and spurs company to reduce their emissions, while giving them the flexibility to do so in a way that makes the most economic sense.",3,613,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00613
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"As climate action gains greater urgency globally, the transition towards lower carbon and carbon neutral operations will increasingly become a pre-requisite for consumers, for investors. Hence, it is in the company's commercial interest to decarbonise and, in the same way, it is also critical for Singapore to transit to a low-carbon economy to maintain our long-term economic competitiveness, to remain an attractive investment and business destination as reminded by Ms Janet Ang, Mr Xie Yao Quan and many other Members during their very passionate speeches earlier, and to ensure good jobs for Singaporeans and good jobs created here in Singapore.",4,614,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00614
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),We have sought public and the industry feedback on the draft Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill. The majority of the respondents acknowledged the role of an appropriate price signal for carbon in order to enable the low-carbon transition.,5,615,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00615
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"For example, some respondents will favour a more aggressive carbon tax trajectory, given the latest recommendations by the IPCC for stronger actions to reach the Paris Agreement goals and the urgency to reduce rising greenhouse gas emissions.",6,616,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00616
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"On the other hand, some companies are concerned that the higher carbon tax will add to cost pressures, especially for the export-oriented companies that have to compete with those from jurisdictions with lower or no effective carbon price.",7,617,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00617
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Apart from the public consultation and since the announcement of the changes to carbon tax earlier this year, we have been engaging businesses that will be directly impacted by the increase. We appreciate their feedback that they recognise the need for an appropriate carbon price, but they are also concerned about the impact of higher carbon taxes on their operating costs and competitiveness.",8,618,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00618
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"We hear and we understand their need for time to make the necessary investments and changes to transit towards greener operations. This is especially so for companies that depend on low-carbon technologies which are still under development, such as CCUS, like low-carbon hydrogen that some of the Members talked about – Ms Poh Li San, Mr Cheng Hsing Yao and Mr Xie Yao Quan.",9,619,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00619
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"I want to assure the House that in designing the carbon tax framework, we have taken into consideration all these varying views and feedback. And I want to assure the House that we will continue engaging companies on their sustainability journey, including our SMEs and LLEs. Let me now respond to the points raised by Members on the impact of the carbon tax on businesses and how the Government is committed to actively supporting our companies as they adjust to the revised carbon tax regime.",10,620,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00620
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Firstly, I wish to highlight that under the carbon tax regime, only facilities that directly emit at least 25,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent of GHGs annually will be subject to the carbon tax. In this way, the carbon tax is targeted to apply to the key nodes of emissions in our economy. It will cover about 80% of our total carbon emissions. Businesses that are large emitters, for example in the energy and chemical sectors, will be directly impacted by the carbon tax.",11,621,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00621
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"We recognise the challenges that companies face, especially amid other increasingly tough operating conditions. The impact of the revised carbon tax regime will be especially pronounced for companies in the EITE sectors, such as the chemicals as well as the semiconductor sectors.",12,622,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00622
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Ms Janet Ang, and also Mr Xie Yao Quan – during their speeches, reminded us that these companies compete globally and face competition from counterparts in jurisdictions which have lower or, in fact, no carbon prices. In addition, many jurisdictions with carbon prices offer generous allowances and support to companies in EITE sectors to protect their business competitiveness. The allowances provided could cover as high as 100% of the companies' emissions in some of these countries.",13,623,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00623
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"It is with these factors in mind that the Government decided to announce the changes to our carbon tax rates ahead of time. We have spelt out the rates for up to 2027 and provided a range for up to 2030. This demonstrates our commitment to work closely with the industries to make the green transition as smooth as possible and by providing companies with advance notice, we hope it will facilitate their business decisions and plans for decarbonisation.",14,624,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00624
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"During her passionate speech, Ms Janet Ang reminded us that many EITE companies have placed significant and substantial investments in Singapore that continue to provide good jobs and secured jobs for Singaporeans and contribute to our economic growth. The sustainability journey is one that we walk together – and we seek to smoothen the transition path for companies – by providing the necessary support for their decarbonisation while maintaining Singapore's competitive edge.",15,625,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00625
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Hence, we will introduce a transition framework which will provide eligible companies with transitory allowances for a portion of their emissions.",16,626,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00626
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Members Mr Don Wee and Mr Leon Perera have asked if the transition framework will erode the price signal for companies to decarbonise and if the framework should be tightened. Let me reassure Members that the transition framework will not give a ""free pass"" to the companies. Singapore has committed to enhancing our 2030 NDCs to reduce our emissions to around 60 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030 and that is after peaking emissions earlier and to achieve net zero by year 2050.",17,627,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00627
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"This means that the Singapore Government is accountable to these international climate commitments, and hence, we will ensure that the transition framework will effectively, robustly drive companies to decarbonise. To address Mr Don Wee's concern, we will work with companies, including the large emitters, to ensure they have decarbonisation plans aligned with Singapore's net-zero commitment.",18,628,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00628
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),We are mindful that the transition allowances provided will not run counter to our long-term goals. I want to ensure and emphasise that the amount of allowances provided will only be for a portion of the companies' emissions. This will be determined based on internationally recognised efficiency benchmarks where available or based on the facilities' decarbonisation plans.,19,629,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00629
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"This means that any emissions above the allowances will still be taxed at the prevailing carbon tax rate. In time, when appropriate, the Government will also release aggregated information on the number of allowances provided, but I think Members have also raised, and they understand, that we will need to bear in mind considerations, such as whether such disclosures inadvertently divulge commercially sensitive information.",20,630,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00630
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"To address Mr Don Wee's query, the allowances are only provided for the carbon tax and are not tradable. In addition, the allowances will also be reviewed regularly against how the companies have fared against the efficiency benchmarks where available or based on their decarbonisation plans.",21,631,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00631
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Earlier in their speeches, Mr Cheng Hsing Yao and Ms Janet Ang spoke about the need to ensure that we are not being too prescriptive. We agree with them. We need to ensure that the framework retains some flexibility, adaptability to ensure that as we transit into a low-carbon future, Singapore remains a compelling and attractive business and investment location here, so that we can create good jobs, including new green jobs for Singaporeans.",22,632,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00632
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"We will also take into consideration international developments as well as technological developments of decarbonisation technologies, including CCUS, low-carbon hydrogen, much like how Ms Janet Ang spoke about the need to consider the state of technology development in determining the allowances. So, I can assure her that we will keep our eyes and ears very close on the global development, not just the efficiency standards, but also low-carbon technology developments.",23,633,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00633
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Furthermore, only existing investments and commitments will be eligible for transitory allowances. Many of these investments were made amidst a different operating context and would require time for them to transit, for them to make the necessary investment to ease into lower carbon operations.",24,634,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00634
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Without transitory support, there will be a significant near-term impact on their competitiveness. So, the transitionary support would especially help companies that have made large capital investments in Singapore, and have contributed to our economic story and the growth of jobs here in Singapore.",25,635,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00635
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"The transition framework will also help to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage – a risk that many Members spoke about in their speeches – so that we avoid companies shifting operations to other jurisdictions with lower or no effective carbon prices. Members reminded us that today, as we debate this Bill, Singapore is the only country within Southeast Asia to implement a carbon price regime. So, we want to make sure we mitigate any risks of carbon leakage because such an outcome would actually lead to loss of jobs and loss of economic value in Singapore, with no overall global reduction in emissions, if there is carbon leakage.",26,636,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00636
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mr Louis Ng, in his earlier speech, and Ms Poh Li San asked about the period of transition that will be provided to companies in the EITE sectors. I want to assure them that we will calibrate the duration of the transition framework based on international standards, developments and technological developments or decarbonisation techniques. We are aware that the carbon prices in other jurisdictions are not static – some may continue to maintain very low and, in some cases, no carbon prices for certain sectors at all, while others may raise carbon prices more aggressively. We are keeping a very close eye on that.",27,637,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00637
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),We also recognise that companies will need time to transition to low-carbon operations. The Government will consider all these factors when calibrating the transition framework. We will also inform companies in advance of the changes to facilitate business planning.,28,638,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00638
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mr Leon Perera earlier proposed that the allowances be awarded only to facilities that have received allowances for no more than one of the four preceding emissions' years. I want to share with him that companies had shared with us during the consultation that they need time to develop and implement new technologies to decarbonise and transform their operations. This effort could take a couple of years. Hence, restricting allowances in the manner suggested will not provide the support that is needed by the companies, nor meet the intended objective of the transition framework.",29,639,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00639
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mr Leon Perera also proposed that the awards of allowances, includes information such as reasons for awarding the allowances, be listed on a public registry. Earlier on, Ms Janet Ang shared that doing this might be unwise. Members will appreciate that doing so may reveal commercially sensitive information about a facility's scale of operations, revenue and so on, and over time really erode Singapore's competitiveness as a business and investment location and then at the end of the day, it will affect our ability to create good jobs for Singaporeans. Earlier, I said that the Government will, in time, release aggregated information on the amount of allowances provided. I have also explained the reasons and the basis for awarding the allowances earlier.",30,640,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00640
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mr Don Wee earlier also asked if Singapore is considering a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). A CBAM proposes a carbon tariff on carbon-intensive imports to stem carbon leakage to countries without a carbon price. We currently have no plans to introduce a CBAM because as a small market, putting in place tariff barriers would disadvantage our own companies and have a limited impact on stemming carbon leakage. Having said that, we will continue to monitor the global developments on CBAM and calibrate our position accordingly.",31,641,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00641
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mr Cheng Hsing Yao and Mr Mark Chay spoke about the need to ensure energy security, resilience and to preserve optionality as Singapore moves towards our net-zero emissions. I fully agree with them because energy security is always at the top of our minds even as we seek to decarbonise our grid. For example, as we scale up electricity imports, we will put in place sufficient backup generation capacity to ensure a continuous supply, even in the event of disruptions. Many Members also spoke about how we recently announced our National Hydrogen Strategy.",32,642,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00642
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Indeed, like what Mr Cheng Hsing Yao, Ms Poh Li San and other Members have said, hydrogen can complement and diversify our power mix alongside with solar, alongside with imported electricity as well as other potential low-carbon energy sources. In importing hydrogen, like other energy sources, we will adopt a diversified portfolio to ensure energy security and to ensure energy resilience.",33,643,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00643
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"We are pressing ahead with the development of such low-carbon alternatives, which will provide more options for businesses and consumers seeking to purchase renewable energy. But even so, and especially in the interim, I think Members will agree with us that both businesses and consumers – and in fact – all of us must play a part and improve energy efficiency and optimise and reduce energy consumption.",34,644,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00644
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Ms Poh Li San, Mr Xie Yao Quan, Ms Janet Ang and Mr Mark Chay asked about the support for companies that are paying higher electricity prices either due to the current energy situation, or indirectly, due to the carbon tax. We understand the challenges that our businesses are facing. We recognise that the companies will be affected by the indirect impact of the carbon tax, through electricity prices.",35,645,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00645
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Earlier on, Second Minister Tan See Leng addressed many of these energy Parliamentary Questions and shared with the House that as Singapore imports more than 90% of our energy needs, we cannot be fully insulated from developments, including volatilities in the global energy market. This is why we have adopted a calibrated approach of right-pricing electricity to help encourage prudent use of electricity.",36,646,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00646
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"At the same time, we will continue to support our businesses and SMEs to make more sustainable business decisions. For instance, we have schemes to help our companies like our SMEs improve their energy efficiency, which will, in turn, reduce their energy costs as well as the impact of the carbon tax. These include the Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions (REG(E)) administered by EDB as well as the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) administered by NEA.",37,647,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00647
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Let me just cite two projects very quickly. One project under the REG(E) scheme supported the replacement of a facility's existing chiller system with a more energy-efficient one, achieving energy savings of more than 3,600MWh. What does this mean? This is equivalent to an abatement of over 1,700 tonnes of carbon emissions annually. This is one REG(E) project and we want to encourage our companies to come on board the various schemes, whether it is the REG(E) or E2F, or the more recently rolled out Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG).",38,648,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00648
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"To Mr Mark Chay's query, we also periodically review these schemes to assess if updates and refinements are needed. We want to make sure they are relevant and accessible to our SMEs. For example, the E2F was just enhanced about six months ago in April this year. What did we do? We raised the grant support cap for the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, from what used to be 50%, we raised it to 70% of the qualifying costs. NEA has also recently simplified the grant application as well as the disbursement process for the standard retrofit projects. So, this makes it easier for SMEs and companies to apply and to benefit from the E2F.",39,649,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00649
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Let me give Members another quick example to show that even micro enterprises and smaller SMEs can come on board. This example is of a local company that has benefited from the E2F. The company's name is Kawarin Enterprise Pte Ltd. This is a local steel manufacturing company. With the support from the Energy Efficiency Fund, Kawarin upgraded their old air compressors to more energy-efficient models. Members may ask what the benefits are. This has allowed Kawarin Enterprise Pte Ltd to enjoy annual cost savings of more than S$30,000 and abated about 48 tonnes of carbon annually. This is just one E2F project. So, I hope that Members of the House will help us to share this information and allow more SMEs and local companies to benefit from all this array of programmes that we have availed to them.",40,650,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00650
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"I want to assure the House that the Government will continue to monitor overall costs for businesses, which could be driven by many factors. We have discussed about that besides the carbon tax, and MTI and the economic agencies stand ready to provide more assistance when needed.",41,651,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00651
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government remains fully committed to working with our industries on their decarbonisation journey to become more sustainable and more competitive in a low-carbon economy.

2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, on the environment. As Ms Janet Ang has highlighted, we must ensure that the carbon credits surrendered, or ""offset"", are of high environmental integrity. Ms He Ting Ru brought up the same point.",9,662,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00662
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our ICC framework will be underpinned by a set of robust criteria, which will, minimally, be aligned to the CORSIA standards which have been endorsed internationally. CORSIA standards are amongst the most rigorous in carbon markets worldwide and they include criteria, such as additionality and permanence – issues that Ms He Ting Ru has mentioned. ""Additionality"" means that emission reductions must be ""above business as usual"" levels. Permanence requires emission reductions to be durable and irreversible.",10,663,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00663
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Furthermore, we will ensure alignment with international rules, such as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. One such requirement is ""no double counting"". Double counting occurs when an eligible ICC accrues to both Singapore and the host country producing this ICC. To prevent this ICC from being double counted, the host country must authorise a corresponding adjustment, to ""give up"" the emissions reduction to Singapore. These are standards which must be mutually agreed upon when we conclude carbon credits collaboration with partner countries.",11,664,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00664

There is also a parallel work stream that is going on on the voluntary market side. So, MAS, the Singapore Exchange (SGX), for example, are hard at work to contribute to credible and robust taxonomies. This is a very nascent area and I think many parties, many different organisations, different sectors, are working very quickly to get alignment and harmonisation of standards. Singapore must be there in order to have the first-mover advantage that Ms Janet Ang has talked about.",16,669,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00669

In July, NEA signed MOUs with leading carbon crediting programmes, namely, Verra and Gold Standard, which, together, account for over 70% of global carbon credit issuances. With these MOUs in place, companies will be able to acquire eligible ICC from projects registered with these programmes and surrender them to offset part of their carbon tax liabilities.",20,673,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00673

Carbon services are a promising potential growth area for Singapore that can create good, green jobs for Singaporeans, while contributing to the global agenda on climate change. Growth in carbon markets will drive demand for jobs related to low-carbon project development, financing, consultancy and measurement, reporting and verification, or MRV.",21,674,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00674

One notable example is the Climate Action Data Trust, or CAD Trust, which will be officially launched next month as a global market infrastructure supported by the World Bank, the International Emissions Trading Association and the Singapore Government. The CAD Trust will be anchored in Singapore to provide an open-source system to link and harmonise information about carbon credits and projects across registries globally. This initiative will drive market transparency, strengthen trust and advance global climate action. And Singapore, I think, is well-placed because we have developed trust and confidence with investors over decades, and we will maintain this confidence and high-level integrity in this new area that we go into as well. The CAD Trust will join a thriving ecosystem of over 70 organisations in Singapore, providing carbon services to the region and beyond.",22,675,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00675

Other Members also asked about the development of voluntary carbon trading activities. I would like to clarify again that the ICC framework does not apply to the voluntary carbon market. It is not envisaged for this Bill to address that.,23,676,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00676

As mentioned earlier, we are starting with 5% as the facility-level limit to prioritise domestic abatement efforts. Are we right? Does it have to be 5%? Can it be 8%? Can it be 3%? Nobody knows. We are in a new area. So, what we will do is to start at 5% as the limit that we think that we can manage and then, as the market develops, we will see how it goes and we will make changes along the way.",25,678,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00678

2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I understand that Ms He Ting Ru has suggested that perhaps we can have disclosure without financial details. But imagine if we are in a situation where we are discussing with companies on what type of ICC they are going to engage in and if a company has something that is groundbreaking, that requires significant ICC to justify the investment, but the system up there says that ""Look, anything above 5% – disclosure, disclosure – even though details are not there, your names will be flashed on the papers"". Do you think there will be more companies stepping forward or there will be fewer companies stepping forward?",29,682,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00682

2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The current carbon tax threshold of 25,000 tonnes ensures that the carbon price is efficiently applied at key nodes of the economy and maximises coverage while it minimises – I would say optimises – the administrative burden on businesses. This covers around 80% of Singapore's emissions, one of the most comprehensive in the world. Coupled with our existing taxes on transport fuels, which are not subjected to carbon tax – we have separate taxes on fuels – we are achieving around 90% coverage. We are one of the world's highest.",33,686,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00686
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Louis Ng asked how compliance costs would increase if the next tier of facilities – that is, the reportable facilities – were taxed as well. Such facilities would have to incur not just the cost of reporting or the cost of paying taxes. They will have to get their reported emissions verified because, once you have to pay tax, we will need you to have it checked by experts, by auditors, and this will be a cost burden for a company, perhaps with a much lower carbon tax. So, it will be disproportionate to the carbon tax payable. Furthermore, as reportable facilities contribute only about 1% of Singapore's emissions, it would add little to the already high coverage of 80%.",34,687,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00687

So, perhaps, instead of giving a fixed number that may bind the hands of policymakers of the future, he has suggested that the carbon tax adhere to a central rate but with a variable component that varies over time according to conditions of the economy. In other hands, scale back when the economy is in recession, raise when the economy is strong. I will have much difficulty in implementation.

When you want them to invest in a plant that is energy-efficient, that captures carbon or uses green hydrogen, you have to tell them what is likely going to be the prevailing carbon tax so that when they do a multi-year calculation, as Member Leon Perera has stated that is what companies would do, sometimes even up to 10, 20 years, they need to have certainty. Otherwise, they will not be able to price in the effect of a higher carbon price. Otherwise, it will be unfair to companies who have invested in hydrogen and then turn around and find that there are no takers because the carbon price differential is missing. The Government said that it was going to do it, but because of the economic situation, is now not doing. So, we find it very hard to accept his suggestion.",48,701,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00701

We are suggesting that we raise the carbon tax in 2024 and that leaves us six years to 2030. So, if you are going to push back one, two years until the recession is completely over – which I really do not know when that is going to be – that means that it leaves us with about four years to raise it from $5 to $100 per tonne.

2022-11-08-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,724,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00724
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I thank the Minister for her round-up speech. And, like the Minister, I would also emphasise that there is agreement from Members of both the ruling party and the Opposition on the need for us to hike the carbon price and on the broad thrusts of this Bill. I just have a few clarifications on the points that the Minister mentioned in relation to some of the amendments that we have filed.",1,725,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00725
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Firstly, on the limitations on time for the allowance regime, the changes that we have proposed, I do take the point made by Minister of State Low Yen Ling that the Government has set a more ambitious target overall in aggregate for carbon emissions to achieve a certain target by 2030, and that puts pressure on the Government to curb and curtail allowances.",2,726,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00726
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Nevertheless, having a more ambitious aggregate target may still allow either this Government or some future Government, in theory, in principle, to prop up a company with a fairly generous level of allowances in perpetuity, for a long time, and to do so in a manner that is not transparent. Were that to happen, were that possibility to be left open in the legislation, that possibility would undermine wider public acceptance of a much-needed carbon price hike, and perhaps, acceptance within the business community itself. If I am a company that is a large emitter, I would want to know that there is a certain amount of transparency about which entities are being given allowances.",3,727,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00727
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"So, I would like to pose this clarification, which is that, is the Government open to having some kind of legislative mechanism that would limit the allowances, in terms of time, to prevent this possibility of a company in perpetuity getting allowances up to the maximum that is referred to in the point of reference. That is my first clarification.",4,728,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00728
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second clarification is, would the Government acknowledge that, notwithstanding the changes that we have suggested to the allowance regime, the Government possesses other tools through other laws, other powers that allow it to apply economic incentives in cases where it may really be necessary to prevent disinvestment for job creation, job defence. And that would allow us to have a carbon pricing regime where the curtailment on the allowance regime is a bit clearer and the transparency level is a bit better, but at the same time, we are still able to retain and win these strategically important projects. That is my second clarification.",5,729,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00729
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My third clarification is, in terms of the public registry that we have suggested. I want to stress again that we are not calling for the amounts of allowances to be disclosed or the amounts of ICCs being used to be disclosed. But I would like to ask again whether the Government would consider that a public registry may actually strengthen confidence in the regime buy-in to a new carbon price hike, which does impose significant burdens on companies and on households, and would impose a certain amount of public accountability, for the public to know that these are the entities that are getting allowances and we are able to see that these entities are doing their best or they are contributing back to the country, they are making progress towards lowering their emissions and so on. Would the Government acknowledge that there are some benefits to that transparency?",6,730,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00730
2022-11-08-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"And my last clarification is, if the Government does not wish to have this public register, I believe both Minister of State Low Yen Ling and Minister Grace Fu referred to the Government is studying, publishing some kind of aggregate data in the future. Would the Government be open to publishing the number of allowances that have been awarded, just in aggregate, and the extent of emissions that are covered by allowances in aggregate, in the future, if they do not want this public registry proposal?",7,731,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00731
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Leon Perera for his clarifications. I want to assure him, and also the House, that even as we put in place the transition framework to support the EITE companies to transit to low-carbon future, I want to assure him that we maintain the impetus for them to decarbonise as quickly as possible. In fact, we want to catalyse the process for them to do so. And certainly, as we roll out the transition framework, it will not give any companies a free pass.",1,732,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00732
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I just want to reiterate again. The Singapore Government just updated our 2030 NDC commitment. And Members said that, as far as Singapore is concerned, people know that when we say we will do it, we will achieve it. In fact, we will put in place interim milestones to make sure we get there by 2030 and by 2050. And so, the Singapore Government is certainly accountable to this international climate commitment. That is why the transition framework that we put in place is meant to ensure that the EITE companies are able to catalyse their decarbonisation journey.",2,733,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00733
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to assure him that even as we avail the allowance, it is really only for a portion of the emissions. It is given based on internationally recognised efficiency standards, where available, as well as the individual facilities' decarbonisation plans. All these plans, I can assure you, will be scrutinised and there will be checks and balances within the relevant authority and within the Ministry, and in fact, across Ministries, because as far as climate change is concerned, we have an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC). So, there are checks and balances, there is accountability, there is transparency.",3,734,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00734
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I shared with the House earlier in my speech, in time, where appropriate, the Government will certainly release aggregated information on the amount of allowances provided. But I urge everyone to have a care. And I think Ms Janet Ang and many Members reminded us that at this very nascent stage, as we are creating this, to make sure that we are well-placed to capture the green opportunities, not just for SMEs, but also for Singaporean workers, our youths, our mid-career hires, and so on. We want to make sure that we do not overly constrain our ability to respond to the emerging market opportunities and the trends as well. So, we need to bear in mind whether such disclosures may inadvertently divulge commercially sensitive information now.",4,735,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00735
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to share some numbers very quickly. We talked about some of these sectors and Ms Janet Ang reminded us that the EITE companies have poured in significant, in fact, billions of dollars of investment in Singapore over the decades, creating very good jobs for Singaporeans. These EITE companies are key investors and are global leaders that collectively contribute about S$21 billion in value-add and employ about 29,000 workers here in Singapore. Not just that, not just economic value-add, not just jobs, but they also form an important ecosystem for our local SMEs as their suppliers, as their business partners.",5,736,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00736
2022-11-08-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"So, these are really what is at stake. To make sure that we take a very calibrated approach as we put in place a transition framework, as we catalyse their transition to a low-carbon future, we want to make sure that we do not inadvertently diminish our competitiveness as a business and investment location, thereby hurting our ability to create good jobs for people in Singapore.",6,737,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00737
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,I would like to add on to Minister of State Low Yen Ling's reply. We are an accountable Government and we are prepared to be accountable to the people. We are accountable with our results.,1,738,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00738
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, you are going to look at our commitments in 2030, our year-to-year carbon emissions and hold us accountable.",2,739,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00739
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I think the line of questioning that the Member has taken, seems to suggest that we have something to hide and we need to hide some incentives somewhere else. There is really no need. What we want is to make sure that our public officers have the ability to engage companies confidently, keeping in mind their obligation to maintain commercial confidentiality for the simple reasons that the companies may be competitors themselves. Secondly, we may have competitors outside Singapore.",3,740,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00740
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, like many of these discussions, like many of these plans, we want to respect each other's requirements, so we have taken the stand that we will keep individual disclosure confidential.",4,741,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00741
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ultimately, you look at our Budget, every year – have we overspent? Do we have items that are not accounted for? Do we have schemes that cannot be explained to people? I think our track record speaks for itself. We will stand in this House again, year after year, to justify to you how we have been doing on our Green Plan and our carbon emissions.",5,742,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00742
2022-11-08-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.,1,743,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00743
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Speaker. Just two clarifications to Minister Grace Fu. The first has to do with the notion of whether we are indeed calling for a higher rate. And the median I suggested was $100 a tonne. It is true, certainly, that in the long run, we seek for something of that nature for good reason, as I had explained. It was the mid-point of what is scientifically credible and defensible.",1,744,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00744
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"That said, I think it is important to distinguish between the appropriate level versus the manner by which we get to that level – the glide path, if you will. The analogy is to think about how one might choose to target one's weight loss journey. First, you choose a target weight. Let us say, I really wish to be 65 kilogrammes.",2,745,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00745
2022-11-08-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, what is your clarification?",1,746,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00746
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Yes, so, the clarification then is whether the Ministry sees or does not see the merits of separating these two decisions – about the appropriate level of the carbon tax versus the glide path to get there.",1,747,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00747
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"My second clarification has to do with something that she said about how businesses cannot operate without certainty, when we do not know what the carbon tax is going to be. I am befuddled. Even now, the Government routinely alters levers of policy such as the interest rate when there is uncertainty on a year-to-year basis, about the level of interest rates, yet businesses continue to invest. Put it another way, let us say the Ministry telegraphed that it was originally going for —",2,748,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00748
2022-11-08-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Again, what is the clarification?",1,749,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00749
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"I am getting there, Sir. So, originally the Ministry telegraphed the $25 a tonne rate next year. And we entered into a recession. Would she believe that businesses would then be very upset if we said that we would scale this $25 a tonne back to something lower, to eventually raise it subsequently?",1,750,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00750
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, Assoc Prof Lim started his speech earlier saying that we have the theory right, but we need to get the implementation right. So, I would like to maybe ask him for his suggestion of how the Government should be positioning the carbon tax in his way. What will be the target – it is $100, so, if it is long run, which year? Is it 2030 still?",1,751,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00751
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Just to be clear, the Government has not also committed to a $50 a tonne —",1,752,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00752
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Oh, we have – $50 to $80 is our range. So, what is your range?",1,753,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00753
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"It was well stated  $58 to $133, with the mid-point being $100.",1,754,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00754
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Okay. So, your range is higher than the Government, is it correct?",1,755,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00755

Can you please try to tell me, if you are the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, how would you glide to this number? How would you glide? We are at the end of 2022. You are going to go out and say, ""Company, this is the new glide path."" How would you describe your glide path?",1,759,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00759
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"That was the content of my speech. I suggested that we could do it incrementally, the way that the Ministry has suggested. But I also suggested that we could allow the specific level to adjust upward and downward, according to economic conditions.",1,760,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00760
2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, are you then saying that we can go out to the world, and say, ""Sorry, I have made the 2030 NDC on the basis of certain economic conditions. And now that the economic conditions are bad, there is a war out there, there is high inflation in energy costs, my NDCs do not count because I need to glide further out""?",1,761,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00761
2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"No, but I think I was clear that the adjustments upwards and downwards are the same way that business cycles go upward and downward. So, you would have it lower in a given year, because of economic conditions. But when things pick up, you would raise it back so that you met the original targets.",1,762,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00762

2022-11-08-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, I am happy to clarify. Again, we are not opposed to the original path. So, for the next year and the subsequent year, we are comfortable with going with that $25 that was originally there.

And Members have spoken so passionately about the need to address the tragedy of the commons, climate change that is confronting us. So, are we going to delay it further? No. The answer is we all need to change.",1,775,2022-11-08-T-009-S-00775

2022-11-08-T-009,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"But the signal to the companies must be that this is a path that the Government is going ahead with. We will have to make investments with these numbers in mind, bearing in mind that our investments in the petrochemical industry or in the power generation industry are multi-year.

If we need certainty, how do we address conditions that we do not foresee? If we have a COVID-19 again – touch wood, hope that we will never have it – but if we have a COVID-19, or we have a major recession; of course, we will have to think about ways to cushion it.

2022-11-08-T-010,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,"Besides content about self-harm, there are many other types of harmful online content including those that promote violence, sexual abuse or enmity between races. If we allow such content to flood our cyberspace, many people, especially our young, would be adversely affected; and the social cohesion that we built preciously over the years may also be at risk.",3,947,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00947
2022-11-08-T-010,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,"That said, there is no law that can shield us totally from harmful content. Therefore, as the Government strengthens the law, our hope is that as parents, we can encourage our children to tell us whenever they encounter problems online, so that we can support them. Our hope is for social media platforms to innovate and come up with newer technologies to protect users, beyond just fulfilling their obligations.",4,948,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00948

2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"When social media first emerged, many people saw it as an unadulterated good thing – a new frontier, separate from the real world, offering freedom of speech without ill consequences. Indeed, the founders of many social media companies had good intentions – to connect users from around the world; to give them personal control to express what they desire and exchange ideas; to be free of oppression; to come together and do good for themselves and their societies.",2,957,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00957
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Years passed, and alas, we know that the reality is far from the ideal. We have seen how extremism gets propagated online, inspiring and triggering acts of terrorism in parts of the world. We have seen how young lives were lost to dark and depressing content, and irrational online movements such as the ""Blackout challenge"". We have seen how hate speeches, in the name of free speech, get disseminated and cause great divisions within society.",3,958,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00958
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"These are worrying trends that we see around the world and countries, including those that uphold democracy and free speech, are facing the same challenges. Singapore, too, is not spared. As a society, we must respond to curb its ills and protect the vulnerable, while allowing the widest possible.",4,959,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00959
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"So, our legislation must evolve to better protect our people from harmful online content, especially minors who are more susceptible and vulnerable. In this, Singapore is not alone in passing such a legislation. Australia and Germany are some of the first few countries to have done so, and others are either doing the same, or thinking of doing the same.",5,960,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00960
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"The Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendment) Bill builds on some of our existing laws to further recognise that happenings online can have a real impact in the physical world and actions must be taken to address issues concerning the safety and well-being of our people. The Bill also represents a shift in some ways. Firstly, protecting users is no longer just the responsibility of the Government or the individual users themselves, but also the OCS providers, who will now be explicitly required to implement tangible measures or face legal consequences for failing to do so. Secondly, giving teeth to our agencies to compel these OCS providers to act on harmful and egregious content, even if these service providers are not situated on our shores.",6,961,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00961
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"On the Internet, all types of information, the good and the bad, are readily accessible and can be proliferated widely almost instantaneously, thereby extending the harm it can bring onto innocent people. In instances of bullying, the Internet magnifies the effects. And, in other instances, the widespread egregious content could mislead and cause harm to the innocent. Thus, I believe that most, if not all, will agree on the importance of protecting those who are vulnerable online.",7,962,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00962
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Nonetheless, I have the following questions to ask about the Bill.",8,963,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00963
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, I think it is quite clear that the Ministry is taking a whitelist approach to applying the Codes of Practice. Therefore, I would like to ask  how does the Ministry determine which OCS providers make it into the whitelist? What criteria or parameters do the Ministry consider?",9,964,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00964
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, I note that private messages will not be covered in this Bill. I suppose the Ministry is trying to strike a balance between offering sufficient protection whilst not being overly intrusive. However, there could be instances where objectionable content gets shared through private messaging channels. Moreover, in the context of Australia where its online safety act was passed just last year and came into effect earlier this year, private messaging is included. Could the Ministry explain the considerations made when deciding what to cover and what not to cover? Perhaps, the Ministry could also share the lessons learnt or the observations made of other jurisdictions where similar legislation was passed before us.",10,965,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00965
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Thirdly, while the Ministry has a broad list of what constitutes egregious content, such as content that advocates or instructs on suicide, self-harm, violence, child sexual exploitation, public health risk, racial and religious disharmony and terrorism, who and how will this assessment and decision be made on what actually crosses the threshold to qualify as egregious?",11,966,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00966
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"While I applaud the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill for being a timely one, I would also like to know  how frequent does the Ministry intend to review the Bill? As we know, technological advancement and disruptions happen at accelerating speeds. Along with it comes new issues and operational challenges that the Bill today may not be adequate in addressing.",12,967,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00967
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"For example, with the rise of the metaverse and the increasing number of young people immersing in it, our legislation and protection mechanisms must catch up quickly. In May this year, it was reported on various news sites, such as the BBC and The Business Insider, that a researcher's avatar was sexually assaulted on a metaverse platform called the Horizon World. The researcher from a non-profit advocacy group SumOfUs entered the particular metaverse and, within an hour, her avatar was raped in the virtual space. As she wore her Virtual Reality (VR) equipment during that episode, her controller vibrated when the male avatar strangers touched her, resulting in a physical sensation consequential of what she was experiencing online. The incident left her feeling ""disoriented"". It was a clear instance of how the virtual and physical world boundaries have blurred and how online happenings can cause real harm.",13,968,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00968
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Apparently, that was not an isolated incident, as there were other reports of similar sexual assaults, homophobic and racial slurs, as well as gun violence on Horizon World. Though these reports were specific to Meta's metaverse platform, it is not difficult to imagine similar incidents happening on other metaverse platforms, especially if the different metaverse universes start to connect with one another.",14,969,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00969
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, how will the Bill, in its current form, be able to protect users from such online harms?",15,970,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00970
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"In addition, as we look to a possible future of Web 3.0, where data and control become decentralised, going just after a couple of OCS providers operating in the Web 2.0 world may not be effective enough. Hence, we will need to ensure that our legislation and enforcement capabilities are updated in a timely manner, so that while we do not want to be over-prescriptive, we are also not too big a step behind these technological developments.",16,971,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00971
2022-11-08-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, I hope the Ministry can also share more about what is being done to continually engage industry players and community stakeholders so that our legislation and Codes of Practice not only have teeth but will bite where it matters. With that, I support the Bill.",17,972,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00972

2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Online Safety Bill before us seeks to tackle harmful content on online services like Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, which are accessible to users in Singapore. I support the Bill, given the online harms that people in Singapore have been subject to on social media and on the Internet, and the growing need to protect our people, especially the young, from these harms.",1,974,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00974
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"However, I have some clarifications to seek on the Bill which I hope the Minister will address before we vote on the Bill.",2,975,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00975
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Access to digital communication devices is not optional in this day and age, even for younger children. For example, if a 10-year-old child were to take public transport on his own to and from school, his parents would want him to be able to contact them in case of an emergency or to track his location. In most cases, this can only be done using a mobile phone or smart watch. However, it will be unwise to give that same 10-year-old unfiltered access to the Internet on his phone.",3,976,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00976
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Currently, parents can install a parental control app on their child's phone. This app will allow parents to restrict content, approve apps, set screen times and filter harmful content. It can also locate the child using GPS.",4,977,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00977
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I set this up for my son some time back. However, even with all my professional technical knowledge, it took me quite a bit of time and research to figure out which was the most suitable software to use and how to configure it. I wonder how many parents have tried to set up parental control software for their children. For those who have not, they should be aware that their children and teens essentially have unfiltered access to the Internet and all the harms that come with it. These parents can only regulate their children's Internet access by looking over their shoulders. This is a suboptimal solution, given the asymmetry of technical knowledge between most parents and their children. Most children nowadays can run rings around their parents when it comes to configuring settings on their mobile phones.",5,978,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00978
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Also, for such content filtering to work for young people, age verification is needed. The Code of Practice for Online Safety for Designated Social Media Services proposed by the Ministry states that social media services must have additional measures to protect children, including minimising children's exposure to inappropriate content and ensuring that their account settings are age-appropriate by default.",6,979,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00979
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"However, the Code of Practice does not prescribe how this age verification should be implemented. Indeed, attempts at imposing age verification have previously failed in the United Kingdom's implementation of the Digital Economy Act of 2017, in part because of privacy concerns. Online age verification providers could collect excessive personally identifiable information and process it for other purposes in violation of privacy laws.",7,980,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00980
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Separately, a young user can circumvent age restrictions by declaring his age to be 18 when, in fact, he is only 12. Can I ask the Minister  how will content providers be required to perform age verification checks in practice?",8,981,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00981
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Some Internet service providers do provide parental control tools which block harmful content before they come through the fibre. However, they require a separate subscription that entails an additional cost each month. Many parents are not even aware of this service. They will have to take the effort to log in to their broadband provider's website and subscribe to this service. This additional friction will deter many parents from signing up, leaving young children vulnerable to accessing harmful content without their parents' knowledge.",9,982,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00982
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"It would be better for Internet service providers to block harmful content at the network level by default, rather than expect parents to set up complicated filtering software on their children's devices. This remote filtering should be activated by default for all new mobile and broadband subscriptions and offered for free for all subscribers. This will ensure that even children of less tech-savvy parents will be protected by default. Adults who need full access to the Internet should be able to opt out of the filtering service without any charge.",10,983,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00983
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I am glad to note that under the Code of Practice, content that may encourage young users to engage in dangerous acts will be considered harmful content and be subject to additional safeguards for young users. Examples of these include the ""Skull-breaker Challenge"" where two people trick a friend standing in between them to take a vertical jump, then kick their legs from under them as they are in the air, making them fall backwards and potentially injure their head and back. People sometimes do not properly assess the risk associated with an activity. They may have seen others perform it without incident in a YouTube video and may be tempted to experiment themselves.",11,984,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00984
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Ultimately, we cannot completely insulate young people from all dangerous, harmful and silly online content. The best protection is for parents and teachers to educate their children and students of the potentially harmful content that may be accessed online and the consequences of indulging in them. The Media Literacy Council could also directly push out educational materials on the platforms that young people access, like TikTok and Telegram. This should be an ongoing process, not a one-time effort, because harmful content is constantly evolving, and new trends are always emerging.",12,985,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00985
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Under this Bill, failure to comply with the directions from IMDA could be an offence punishable by a fine on conviction. Can the Minister clarify if this fine will apply to only the company or also the individual officers within the company responsible for ensuring compliance? Given the financial might of social media companies, they might have no problem paying even a huge fine.",13,986,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00986
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The Code of Practice will require social media services to submit annual reports to IMDA to reflect Singapore users' experiences on the service, including the actions that they have taken on user reports.",14,987,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00987
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I would like to propose that social media services also be required to submit quarterly reports, listing the type of content that has been flagged by users. This is so that IMDA can be kept apprised of trends in harmful online content and behaviours.",15,988,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00988
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Section B of the Code of Practice requires that users of OCSs must be able to report harmful content or unwanted interactions to the platform providers through an ""effective, transparent and easy to use mechanism"" and social media services are expected to take action on these user reports in a ""timely manner"".",16,989,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00989
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"This leaves open lots of room for interpretation. In contrast, Australia's Online Safety Act requires platforms to provide a clear and easily accessible complaints system for end-users to submit complaints or requests to remove certain material and the platforms must respond to the complainant within 48 hours, failing which the end-user may contact the eSafety Commissioner, who has the power to investigate the complaint. I would like to propose that Singapore's Code of Practice include these specific requirements and timelines.",17,990,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00990
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Another potential area of harm to young people is online gaming, which can be both addictive and cause social problems.

2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I note that the Bill covers cyberbullying content that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the targeted person.

There have been cases, recently, of disgruntled ex-lovers sharing such images, which, most certainly, will cause alarm and distress to the victim.",19,992,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00992
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Next, I would like to seek clarifications from the Minister regarding the protection of Singaporeans' democratic rights in this Bill.

2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),The Bill gives wide-ranging powers to IMDA to issue directions to social media companies to remove harmful content if it deems it so. Can the Minister elaborate on what safeguards will be in place to ensure that such powers are not abused? Will there be channels for independent appeal or judicial review?,21,994,2022-11-08-T-010-S-00994
2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The UK's Online Safety Bill specifically includes protections to safeguard pluralism and ensure Internet users can continue to engage in robust debate online.

2022-11-08-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),Australia's Online Safety Act itself was controversial in part because of the huge amount of discretion and power it puts in the hands of the Minister for Communications and the eSafety Commissioner to determine what are community expectations.

Can I confirm with the Minister that other private messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal are also excluded from this Bill? For the avoidance of doubt, I am not advocating for these services to be included in this Bill, as they are primarily used for private communication between individuals. Much of the communication is end-to-end encrypted, which means even the platforms do not have access to the data exchanged by their users.

2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In dealing with online harms, it is important to take a calibrated and multi-stakeholder approach while keeping a close eye on emerging technologies, such as Web 3.0 and the metaverse. Although Bill is focused on platform and service providers, there is also a need to focus on the users, particularly, the victims of online harms.",7,1009,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01009
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In June 2021, I started an initiative called Defence Guild SG, a collaborative group of lawyers providing pro bono assistance to victims of online abuse or harms. We now have over 20 lawyers who volunteer pro bono to assist or advise victims who face sexual harassment or online harms. The bulk of the cases they face are time-sensitive given the viral nature of the harmful online content, but most importantly, they are emotionally draining and usually, it is time- and cost-consuming for victims to seek redress.",8,1010,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01010
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Following this initiative, together with other People's Action Party (PAP) Members of Parliament, like Ms Hany Soh and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, we spearheaded the formation of resource toolkit to combat online harms at the PAP Women's Wing International Women's Day celebration in March this year. And in September this year, with the help of pro bono lawyers, social workers and counsellors, we ran a workshop for close to 70 activists across various PAP branches on the practical walkthrough of the resource toolkit.

Hence, raising awareness and empowerment is a continuing endeavour.",10,1012,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01012
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In this regard, I have three suggestions  first, to provide legal pro bono advice under the Legal Aid Bureau for individuals facing online harms, much like what Defence Guild SG is doing for victims currently; second, to standardise the ease of reporting of online harms across all platforms; third, to seek platform and broadcasting service providers to be included in public awareness campaigns on eradicating online harms.

2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Most of the cases they dealt with are sensitive in nature and many within our community are unaware of the type of help available as well as their own rights. However, this protection could not have come about without the partnership of those from the Government, individuals and technology companies or online service providers.

2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"First, on the definitions. In determining whether a broadcasting service is private or domestic, the new section 2(3) of the Broadcasting Act gave regard to certain factors, and I will touch on two of them.",19,1021,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01021
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, on the number of individuals in Singapore who are able to access the content. The clause itself does not state, for guidance, the actual number as a threshold. In this regard, may I ask what would the threshold be? Should it be a percentage of entire users of the service who are in Singapore? Some clarity in this regard would be helpful.",20,1022,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01022
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, on the restrictions on who may access the content. Would content on accounts which are accessible through friends or restricted followers, be considered ""private or domestic nature""?",21,1023,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01023
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, in respect of the new clause 45D which sets out the definition of ""egregious content"", I have a few questions.",22,1024,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01024
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"First, what is meant by content that ""advocates or instructs""? Would the Ministry consider content to be harmful by looking objectively at its impact on our society, even though the content itself may not provide a clear set of instructions or advocate a certain position?",23,1025,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01025
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Second, on resources, may I ask who will be the enforcement agency for this? And would there be a dedicated team to regulate such behaviour? And if so, how are we sufficiently resourced for this?",24,1026,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01026
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"For example, in Australia, the Department of Home Affairs has a dedicated team to find content on social media sites that promote hate, incite violence, or points to terrorist propaganda. The team has a budget of around AUD$3 million. It is a resource-intensive endeavour, and if we rely on self-reporting by individuals or self-regulation by providers, there may be many instances of online harms that fall through the crack.",25,1027,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01027
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Thirdly, I note that certain categories of harms are expressly stated in the Bill. May I ask what about issues relating to drug abuse or any other activities that are illegal or against our social norms – would these be considered harmful content as well? May I suggest that certain discretion be given to include any future definition of harmful content.",26,1028,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01028
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My next clarifications are on the mechanism. I welcome the takedown or disabling order under clause 45H and the blocking order under clause 45I. In particular, the new clause 45E makes it an offence of not stopping egregious content on an OCS.",27,1029,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01029
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"There is also a defence available to service providers in not complying with the order, if it was not reasonably practicable to do more than what was in fact done, or if there was no better practicable means than what was in fact used.",28,1030,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01030
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, may I ask what is meant by ""reasonably practicable""? Would the costs or expenses involved in complying with such order be a relevant factor?",29,1031,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01031
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Likewise, what about actual or consequential loss that the party may suffer when complying with such duty? I would suggest that such costs, expenses and losses are not relevant factors. This is because economic losses or ramifications should not be placed on equal importance footing with online harms that have debilitating and irreversible effects on our society and individuals. Nevertheless, I would welcome Minister's clarifications in this regard.",30,1032,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01032
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, in relation to the immunity given to service providers against criminal or civil liability when complying with the orders – under clause 45J. Would this apply to civil liability brought by parties from outside the jurisdiction as well? I understand and fully appreciate that our laws may not have extraterritorial effect in this respect.",31,1033,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01033
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I am fully aware that the current Bill, as proposed, was done after extensive consultation with service providers and platforms and that they are supportive of such proposals. Other jurisdictions have also passed similar legislation to safeguard against online harms. Perhaps the Ministry can also explore reciprocal immunity provisions with other like-minded jurisdictions in the future. This would help harmonise and set an international standard for compliance of cross-border directions in the future.",32,1034,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01034
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My next clarification is in relation to clause 45H(1)(d) on the period of takedown notice. Can we consider a fixed period? For example, Germany's similar law provides for a 24-hour requirement for takedown. This reflects the imminent risk of such online harms. If there is a standard fixed period by legislation, it will lead to a reasonable expectation or standard within the industry for compliance and sufficient company internal compliance processes can be put in place to meet with such expectations. Alternatively, perhaps, Minister can clarify what is the estimated period that is envisaged for a typical direction or order?",33,1035,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01035
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, may I clarify what is meant by clause 45H(2)(b), that a requirement ""must not require the doing of anything with respect to the provision of an online communication service to the whole or part of any area in Singapore""? Perhaps, can Minister provide an example for this?",34,1036,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01036
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, in relation to the Code of Practice, I welcome such Code of Practice. I understand that the a Code of Practice can be revised or amended pursuant to a process to be followed, which allows for future flexibility and adaptability.",35,1037,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01037
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My question is, given the fluidity and dynamic nature of our digital ecosystem, would the Code be able to keep up with the changes brought upon by the rapid changes in technology?",36,1038,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01038
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I note that there is a process before a change in Code can be made, as envisaged at clause 45L. However, how long would that take? Perhaps, if I may suggest the formation of a council to formulate and update the Code regularly to keep up with technology trends? Such Council can comprise of service providers, regulators, important law enforcement or community stakeholders.",37,1039,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01039
2022-11-08-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In conclusion and most importantly, digital safety is the responsibility of everyone. Notwithstanding the above clarifications, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill.",38,1040,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01040

2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill marks a step in the right direction to create some regime for enforcement of basic standards of protection and decency against acts of online harm. I support the thrust of the Bill and stand in agreement with the arguments made by my Parliamentary colleague, Aljunied Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Giam.",1,1042,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01042
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In particular, I strongly support Mr Giam's call on the Government to provide clear and unequivocal assurances that this law will not be used to curtail the exercise of legitimate free speech that touches on the public acts of public figures and that is not of a vicious and personal nature. I hope the Government can provide such assurances during the Parliamentary debate, to be recorded in the Hansard. Members will recall how the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) was used by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) to take action against an individual, the legitimacy of which was disputed in a subsequent ruling of the Court of Appeals.",2,1043,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01043
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, my speech will focus on the topic of online bullying, particularly as it pertains to children and of the harms of loot boxes and other gambling-like elements in electronic games. Before I address these two topics, let me make some general suggestions and clarifications on the approach taken in this Bill, where more clarity is, perhaps, needed.",3,1044,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01044
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, under the proposed Bill, there are two key parts to the regulatory approach. Firstly, requiring OCSs with significant reach or impact to comply with Code(s) of Practice; and secondly, dealing with egregious content on an OCS that is accessible by Singapore users, by enabling IMDA to issue directions to deal with such content.",4,1045,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01045
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In addition to such measures and perhaps embedded in the Codes of Practice, I wonder if there could be a system where users of OCSs can first report content on the platform that is egregious and/or seriously harassing, to the OCS itself. If the OCS fails to take action within a stipulated time frame, say seven days, then there could be a mechanism whereby the complainant can raise this issue to the IMDA and ask the IMDA to issue the appropriate directions in relation to such content.",5,1046,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01046
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This draws on the Australia's Cyberbullying Scheme. One of its features is that a person may make a complaint to eSafety about cyberbullying material that targets an Australian child and this acts as a safety net, because they must have first reported the material to the relevant online service provider before taking the step. In addition, if the OCS fails to investigate or take action about that content reported by a user within the stipulated time frame, there could be penalties for the OCS.",6,1047,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01047
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"While there are already reporting platforms or tools on most, if not all, of the OCSs, such a requirement embedded in a Code of Practice would create some legal pressure on the OCS to further investigate and act on user notifications or reports of egregious content in a timely manner.",7,1048,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01048
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, section 45D defines ""egregious content"". While this section does contain some specific definitions of egregious content, there could be other types of egregious content where more specificity would be welcome, as my colleague Mr Giam and other Members alluded to.",8,1049,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01049
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In particular, I think that the definition of egregious content given here in the Bill does not adequately deal with the following two categories  firstly, revenge porn or unwanted sharing of intimate images; and secondly, cyberbullying.",9,1050,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01050
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"But at paragraph 4 of the First Reading speech, the June 2022 survey by MCI found that, ""Sexual content, cyberbullying and violent content were the top three types of content that respondents felt the young needed to be protected from most"".

2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"It would seem that the proposed Bill might not address the first two concerns in a sufficiently specific manner.

I hope the subsidiary legislation can be more specific about these two types of egregious content.",11,1052,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01052
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, I note that at paragraph 8 of the Ministry's statement. it is stated that ""The Codes of Practice may require Regulated Online Communication Services (ROCS) providers to put in place measures on their services to mitigate the risks of danger to Singapore users from exposure to harmful content and provide accountability to their users on such measures.""",12,1053,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01053
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to ask the Government how this accountability will come about. Will the Government commit to public consultations when new Codes of Practice are issued? This is hinted at in section 45L(2), but it is not a requirement.

2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, part 9(d) of the same statement refers to how ROCS providers should collaborate or cooperate with the conduct of research studies by experts approved by IMDA. Such research would allow IMDA to understand the nature and level of the systemic risks in the ROCS, and the evolution and severity of such risks.",14,1055,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01055
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, I support this provision. It is a very positive move for MCI to formally refer to the use of research in this manner, since this area of online harms is a rapidly evolving space and since more research needs to be done on the effects of certain online activities, particularly on children.",15,1056,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01056
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I will now move to talking about online bullying of children. Madam, this is a serious issue in Singapore. A 2019 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study found that 26% of Singaporean students reported being bullied at least a few times a month, compared to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 23%. This is not a small number by any means.",16,1057,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01057
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, this subject is somewhat personal to me, as there were short periods of time in both my children's primary school life when they were bullied by friends. It is traumatic for the child and can leave lasting psychological scars. But it is also hard on the parents, arousing feelings of concern, frustrations and yet, helplessness. Why do I say helplessness? Because sometimes, the parents feels that they cannot address the problem with a sledgehammer, by coming down hard on the bullies, who are themselves children and may not fully understand what they are doing.",17,1058,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01058
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The effects of cyberbullying can be deadly. In America, a girl called Megan Meier committed suicide three weeks before her 14th birthday and her suicide was attributed to cyberbullying on the social networking site MySpace. I think the Minister had referred to this example as well. Her classmate's mother had created a fake MySpace account, pretending to be a teenage boy, Josh. ""Josh"" messaged Megan on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) saying something very hurtful. Megan killed herself shortly after.",18,1059,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01059
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, page 9 of the Bill excludes certain services from the scope of the Bill, including SMSes and, in part (e), ""an electronic service where the only user-generated content enabled by that service is communication between two or more end-users that is of a private or domestic nature."" This would imply that the law excludes bullying that takes place among a group of children, where one or more children bullies one child on a chat group, on say the victim's Instagram page.",19,1060,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01060
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, children are a group where cyberbullying can have a very serious effect, given their lack of maturity and lack of life experiences in accessing resources that could help them. A large-scale National Institute of Health study in the United States (US) found that ""the child participants who experienced cyberbullying were more than four times as likely to report thoughts of suicide and attempts as those who did not."" I think this subject of youth mental health, in the context of social media, has been the subject of much public discussion and much research and rightly so, as many experts are tending towards a view that there is a connection between the very extensive social media usage that we are seeing among young people, and the kinds of mental health issues that are coming to the fore.",20,1061,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01061
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, how to deal with this very difficult question – and I confess that I do not have a legislative magic bullet to suggest here. I am not advocating for law enforcement agencies to police private conversations in a way that compromises privacy, could itself be subject to executive over-reach and could corrode our children's capacity to spontaneously interact with one another as well as learn social lessons thereby.",21,1062,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01062
2022-11-08-T-010,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would suggest that for now, the problem can be addressed through education and would like to call on MOE and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to explore this. There are helplines for young victims of bullying, including cyberbullying, such as Tinkle Friend by the Singapore Children's Society, which does good work and deserves support from all of us.",22,1063,2022-11-08-T-010-S-01063

2022-11-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Next, Madam, let me move onto the subject of loot boxes and other gambling-like elements in electronic games. Madam, I have asked several Parliamentary Questions about this subject. The most recent was in 2019 which elicited the reply that the Remote Gambling Act (RGA) would apply to loot boxes, only if the loot thus obtained could potentially be converted into real world money. To quote from that 2019 reply, ""Given the randomness of the prizes in loot boxes, they are a game of chance. However, whether the loot boxes are considered a form of gambling under the RGA, depends on whether there are in-game facilities that allow players to convert game credits or any in-game items, for example, weapons and skills, to real-world money or merchandises.""",2,1071,2022-11-08-T-012-S-01071

From a policy perspective, HDB cannot treat sky gardens as exclusive enclosed spaces. At the same time, we acknowledge that sky gardens are not identical in nature to the ground-level open parks and green spaces that we see in many HDB estates. Because of their elevation and the views that they command, sky gardens might attract visitors who would not go out of their way to visit ground-level HDB parks. And because sky gardens can only be accessed via lifts, visitors will end up sharing these lifts with residents. This is different from ground-level HDB parks that often have multiple points of access. Thus, if the sky gardens attract an unusual volume of visitors during peak times, even residents who do not use the sky gardens regularly might feel inconvenienced by crowding in lifts or at the lift lobbies.",4,1113,2022-11-08-T-015-S-01113

2022-11-08-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Government uses a combination of schemes to meet the diverse needs of different families and circumstances. Various criteria are used to determine eligibility depending on the target beneficiaries. Some schemes, like cash payouts, are based on individual income eligibility. Other schemes, like the Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers, are given on a household basis.",1,1134,2022-11-08-T-016-S-01134
2022-11-08-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Several of our social support measures do take into account family sizes, and especially cater to those with children. For example, to address cost-of-living concerns this year, every Singaporean aged below 21 years old would have received a one-off $200 top-up to their Child Development Account (CDA), Edusave account or Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA). The Ministry of Education (MOE) will also be increasing its support for students from lower-income households, including through enhancing the bursary quanta for pre-university and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students, as well as revising the income eligibility criteria for MOE financial assistance schemes.",2,1135,2022-11-08-T-016-S-01135
2022-11-08-T-016,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More broadly, the Government provides support for the education and healthcare needs of all Singaporeans. Our education and healthcare subsidies are given on an individual basis, so larger families will correspondingly receive more help.

2022-11-08-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, there is no direct prevalence data on the use of vaporisers as these are illegal products and reliable self-reported data is difficult to obtain. The number of offenders caught for purchase, use or possession of vaporisers in 2022 is 3,691, up to September 2022, as compared to 4,697 in 2021. About one-fifth of these offenders were under-18.",2,1149,2022-11-08-T-018-S-01149
2022-11-08-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) monitors and gathers intelligence on illicit sales of e-cigarettes via social media and messaging platforms, and regularly carries out operations targeting sales of e-cigarettes on online platforms. The HSA also collaborates with platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Carousell to remove postings on the illegal sales of such products. In 2020 and 2021, 3,573 and 6,940 postings have been removed respectively. And in 2022, up to September 2022, 3,923 postings have been removed. In year 2021 and 2022, up to September, 32 and 25 online e-vaporiser peddlers have been prosecuted respectively. Concurrently, the illegal importation of e-cigarettes is monitored at Singapore's borders and intercepted as necessary to prevent entry of these e-cigarettes into the local market.",3,1150,2022-11-08-T-018-S-01150
2022-11-08-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There is already a dedicated reporting channel for members of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of prohibited tobacco products.

2022-11-08-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The enforcement activities are also complemented by public education efforts to deter the public from vaping. HSA engages the media to remind the public that the sale, use, possession for sale, importation or distribution of electronic vaporisers are strictly prohibited in Singapore and strongly advises the public against engaging in such activities. A digital campaign on staying vape-free will be rolled out in early 2023 to raise awareness on the negative health effects of vaping and to address misconceptions.",5,1152,2022-11-08-T-018-S-01152
2022-11-08-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We share the concern about vaping amongst minors. The Ministry of Health (MOH) works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to raise awareness among children and youths about the harms of vaping and encourage them to lead a nicotine-free lifestyle. Schools take a serious view of vaping and school-based disciplinary action is also taken for students caught using or possessing e-cigarettes and other types of vaporisers, including suspension or caning for boys. We will work with education institutions and schools to step up efforts to control access of vaporisers and its accessories to minors and the young.",6,1153,2022-11-08-T-018-S-01153
2022-11-08-T-019,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many applications has the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) received since April 2021; (b) what is the RDF's ratio of applicants to grants; and (c) whether the RDF has available funds to support new applicants at the current time.,1,1154,2022-11-08-T-019-S-01154
2022-11-08-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Rare Disease Fund (RDF) operates as an endowed fund to ensure that beneficiaries can be supported for life, as rare disease patients generally require high-cost medicines on a lifelong basis. The RDF Committee which oversees the fund adopts a 'listing' approach, which means that a medicine can only be listed for support after it assesses that the medicine is able to meaningfully extend life expectancy and improve patient's quality of life.",1,1155,2022-11-08-T-019-S-01155
2022-11-08-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, the RDF has listed seven medicines for five conditions. The support is reviewed annually for each beneficiary, to factor in changes in their clinical condition and financial situation. Since April 2021, the RDF has received applications from six patients, all of whom are currently supported by the fund. There are sufficient funds to support these patients.",2,1156,2022-11-08-T-019-S-01156
2022-11-08-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We recognise that there are other rare disease patients requiring non-listed medications, which the RDF currently does not support. Medicines for rare disease patients can exceed $200,000 per patient annually, with varying efficacies, and our healthcare financing system is not designed to support such high-cost treatments. Instead, society and the Government collectively support the financial needs of Singapore citizens with rare diseases through the RDF, with the Government providing $3 of matching grant for every dollar of donation. We have also seen how some patients are able to obtain support from the community through crowdsourcing or other charity funds, which is heartening.",3,1157,2022-11-08-T-019-S-01157
2022-11-08-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There remains the broader question as to whether the Government should support treatments regardless of their cost, particularly if the efficacy is uncertain. This is a position that needs to be carefully reviewed and must not be taken lightly. For now, we will continue to monitor the situation and work towards expanding the scope of RDF treatments that can be supported. We also encourage members of the public to support the RDF with donations so that more medicines and conditions can be listed, and more patients can be supported.",4,1158,2022-11-08-T-019-S-01158
2022-11-08-T-020,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the number of Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) currently available (a) what has been their utilisation rate and effectiveness in reducing second-hand smoke to non-smokers; and (b) whether the Government will consider supporting and funding more DSPs at more locations including housing estates.,1,1159,2022-11-08-T-020-S-01159
2022-11-08-T-020,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) are community-led initiatives in our heartlands. My Ministry does not monitor the number and utilisation rates of DSPs. DSPs may be used by smokers within their immediate vicinity, but their effectiveness in influencing individual smoking behaviour and in reducing the impact of second-hand tobacco smoke on non-smokers would need to be studied further.",1,1160,2022-11-08-T-020-S-01160
2022-11-08-T-020,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"DSPs help to confine second-hand tobacco smoke to areas that can be more easily avoided by the public. However, the proliferation of DSPs needs to be carefully considered and balanced against the risk of inadvertently normalising smoking, especially among youths, and exacerbating the public's exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke if DSPs are not appropriately sited.",2,1161,2022-11-08-T-020-S-01161

To that end, the Traffic Police are studying various models that use different technologies, as well as overseas experiences.",2,1165,2022-11-08-T-021-S-01165

2022-11-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Most flat buyers will not be affected by the introduction of the interest rate floor as they do not take up the maximum housing loan amount. As an illustration, about eight in 10 flat buyers in 2021 would not have been affected by the change in the interest rate floor and lower LTV limit. In addition, first-time buyers, especially lower-income households, will generally be less affected by the lower LTV limit. First-timer flat buyers can enjoy the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant of up to $80,000, in addition to the generous subsidies in the new flat price, or total grants of up to $160,000 if they choose to buy a resale flat. They can use the grants, as well as their CPF and cash savings, to pay for their flat purchase, before taking up a housing loan.",3,1199,2022-11-08-T-029-S-01199
2022-11-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,These measures are necessary as property loans are long-term commitments and often a household's largest liability.

2022-11-08-T-033,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It is worthwhile making these roles permanent through job redesign. In fact, the admin and support care tasks performed by the aviation crew are performed by existing healthcare staff, such as Patient Service Associates and Patient Care Assistants, but there is a limit to how many we can recruit.

2022-11-08-T-042,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) upon the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic, how many Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents born before, in or after 1962 missed the one-year deadline to re-register for their new NRICs, thereby forfeiting the option to pay the subsidised fee of $10 or $50 respectively; and (b) whether a one-off extension of time may be provided to these persons having regard to the effect of the pandemic on them.",1,1248,2022-11-08-T-042-S-01248
2022-11-08-T-042,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is compulsory for Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs) born in or after 1962 to re-register for a new National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) within one year upon turning ages 30 and 55. These compulsory re-registrants will receive a notification letter from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to remind them to re-register within a year. Re-registrants are eligible for a subsidised fee of $10 for SCs and $50 for PRs for the issuance of their new NRIC. NRIC holders who re-register beyond the one-year period will be asked for the reason for their late re-registration. However, the subsidised fee will still be extended to them. From January 2020 to December 2021, approximately 9% of compulsory re-registrants missed the one-year deadline to re-register for their new NRIC.",1,1249,2022-11-08-T-042-S-01249
2022-11-08-T-042,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For SCs and PRs born before 1 January 1962, NRIC re-registration is optional. They will receive the notification letter from ICA to notify them that they have the option to re-register within one year at the subsidised fee of $10 for SCs and $50 for PRs. If they miss the one-year window, a higher re-registration fee of $60 will apply. ICA will assess appeals for the subsidised fee on a case-by-case basis. From January 2020 to December 2021, approximately 72% of optional re-registrants did not re-register for their new NRIC.",2,1250,2022-11-08-T-042-S-01250
2022-11-08-T-043,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry which free trade agreement that Singapore has entered into has (i) achieved the most trade benefits so far and (ii) minimised imported costs and inflationary pressures more ably and effectively.,1,1251,2022-11-08-T-043-S-01251
2022-11-08-T-043,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore currently has a network of 27 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). They have helped our companies access global markets by lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers for Singapore's goods, reducing restrictions for our services sectors and enhancing protection for investments.",1,1252,2022-11-08-T-043-S-01252
2022-11-08-T-043,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is not meaningful to compare FTAs in terms of which agreement delivered the most benefits, as the extent and types of trade we have with each trading partner are unique and different. Moreover, the FTAs do not have the same coverage and are also entered into at different times.",2,1253,2022-11-08-T-043-S-01253
2022-11-08-T-043,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"When new trade partners join our FTA network, the value of our existing FTAs increases as the benefits will apply to a larger market. Singapore's attractiveness as a trade and investment hub will also be enhanced.",3,1254,2022-11-08-T-043-S-01254
2022-11-08-T-043,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"From 2016 to 2021, our total tariff savings from FTAs almost doubled from S$700 million to S$1.3 billion. Over the same period, domestic exports to our FTA partners grew by 26%, from S$190 billion to S$239 billion. From 2016 to 2020, our stock of direct investments in our FTA partners also increased by about 26% from S$611 billion to S$772 billion.",4,1255,2022-11-08-T-043-S-01255
2022-11-08-T-043,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition to tariff savings, improved efficiency from trade facilitation through FTAs has helped reduce business costs and import costs for goods and services exported from and imported into Singapore. Apart from FTAs, we are continuing to diversify the sources of our daily necessities through trade with our FTA partners. Maintaining a strong Singapore dollar is also helping to dampen imported inflation. In addition, the Government has rolled out a series of support packages and measures to help households and businesses cope with higher prices during this challenging period, with more support for those with greater needs.",5,1256,2022-11-08-T-043-S-01256

2022-11-08-T-044,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This $20,000 threshold, together with our progressive tax rates, tax reliefs and tax rebate, results in half the workers in Singapore not needing to pay any PIT currently. Among the individuals who do pay PIT, 80% of them have an effective tax rate of less than 4%. The top 10% of our PIT-paying taxpayers pay the vast majority of PIT collected each year.",2,1259,2022-11-08-T-044-S-01259

2022-11-08-T-045,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The establishment of the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) represents another milestone in Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)'s continuing transformation, to better protect Singapore against evolving and emerging security threats. In particular, from many recent examples including the war in Ukraine, it is clear that the nature of aggression against another country by state and non-state actors has changed, and can involve multiple fronts on air, land, sea and digital domains. Termed “hybrid operations”, these acts of aggression can take place even in peacetime.",1,1263,2022-11-08-T-045-S-01263
2022-11-08-T-045,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In this context, the DIS complements the existing services of Army, Navy and Air Force to jointly and comprehensively protect Singapore's sovereignty and interests. However, some missions will be predominantly undertaken by the DIS, namely, to provide accurate, relevant and timely early warning and operational intelligence, ensure the connectivity of the SAF to operate as a networked force, Cyber and Electronic defence of the SAF's electronic networks and systems and strengthen the psychological resilience of soldiers and the SAF.",2,1264,2022-11-08-T-045-S-01264

Organisational structures, manpower and capabilities are now being streamlined and built up to be able to meet their mission outcomes. Specifically, operational commands have been stood up. To raise, train and sustain their digital and intelligence workforce, recruitment and development efforts are being expanded and enhanced. A Digital Ops-Tech Centre and Digital Ranges are being built to enhance capabilities through better training and simulation facilities. The DIS is expected to double its size by 2030.",4,1266,2022-11-08-T-045-S-01266
2022-11-08-T-046,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the ScamShield mobile app is still relevant since telcos will be required to implement anti-scam filters; (b) whether ScamShield will be enhanced to improve anti-scam measures; (c) how will the Government increase the download rate of ScamShield among vulnerable groups; and (d) whether grants will be offered to businesses using SMS sender IDs and who have financial hardship to offset costs for registering with the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry.,1,1267,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01267
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The ScamShield mobile application was launched as part of the Government's multi-pronged approach to identify and block scam calls and SMSes. The iOS and Android versions were launched in November 2020 and September 2022 respectively. As of October 2022, about 6.5 million SMSes had been flagged to users as potential scams and about 12,900 unique scam-tainted phone numbers have been blacklisted and blocked by ScamShield.",1,1268,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01268
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Telecommunication companies have started implementing additional anti-scam filters for their networks. These filters scan for patterns and malicious URL hyperlinks to identify and block scam SMSes.,2,1269,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01269
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Nonetheless, ScamShield remains useful. It is an additional layer of defence. ScamShield also provides additional protection by blocking calls from blacklisted numbers. In addition, ScamShield has a reporting function to allow users to alert the authorities about the scam messages and calls they receive.",3,1270,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01270
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and Open Government Products are studying ways to enhance ScamShield. One area they are studying is to make it easier for users to report potential scams.,4,1271,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01271
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Police work closely with stakeholders to encourage the download of ScamShield. For example, the Police regularly share crime information, including scam prevention advice, with Residents' Committees and grassroots volunteers, so that in turn, they can engage their residents about scams via their own outreach platforms. Senior citizens are encouraged to download ScamShield during these sessions. Volunteer Crime Prevention Ambassadors from the NCPC also share about ScamShield with residents, including senior citizens, during their engagements. Additionally, the Police have been pushing out publicity on the ScamShield application at various platforms, such as MRT stations and bus stops.",5,1272,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01272
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) was introduced in March 2022 to further strengthen our defences against scam SMSes. The SSIR works with SMS aggregators to block messages attempting to spoof the Sender IDs of organisations which have registered with the SSIR.,6,1273,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01273
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"From 31 January 2023, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) will transition from a voluntary to mandatory SSIR regime. All organisations which wish to use Sender IDs will be required to register their IDs with the SSIR. This transition will take place over six months, after which, all unregistered SMS Sender IDs will be blocked.",7,1274,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01274
2022-11-08-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Businesses are encouraged to register their Sender IDs with the SSIR as soon as possible. To ensure that registration with the SSIR remains affordable for smaller organisations, IMDA has adjusted registration fees, from $1,000 for one bundle of up to 10 Sender IDs, to $200 for each Sender ID. This will reduce costs for smaller businesses, which typically use only one or two Sender IDs. More details are available at https //sgnic.sg/smsregistry/overview.",8,1275,2022-11-08-T-046-S-01275

2022-11-08-T-047,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the other hand, windows are generally not building features that compartmentalise spaces, nor have they been a safety risk during fires. Fire incident sites are usually cordoned off, so that any glass debris would not hurt the public and there have not been related injuries based on Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)'s records. Hence, the Fire Code does not mandate the use of fire-rated glass for windows of high-rise buildings, including Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats.",2,1279,2022-11-08-T-047-S-01279

The Courts have upheld that this access to counsel must be granted after a ""reasonable time"". What constitutes ""reasonable"" depends on the individual facts of each case, balancing the accused's right to legal representation, and the public interest in ensuring thorough and objective investigations. We have to give our law enforcement agencies reasonable time to obtain evidence and get to the truth.",2,1289,2022-11-08-T-049-S-01289

2022-11-08-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Police invests heavily in the training and development of these IOs. They are sent for specialised training conducted by the Home Team School of Criminal Investigation (HTSCI) to deepen capabilities to address complex cases. They also have the opportunity to go on external postings to gain exposure and may be sponsored for professional accreditation. The skills and experience of the IOs are highly sought after in the financial sector.,2,1296,2022-11-08-T-050-S-01296

2022-11-08-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This phased approach is to manage the impact on future hiring, the availability of posts and organisational renewal. Because of the nature of the work and the deep training required, our uniformed services have a pure-build workforce model, and most officers remain in service until retirement. A steady inflow and outflow of manpower is needed each year to meet operational demands and to build a sustainable pipeline of leaders and specialists. Raising the retirement age progressively allows the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to manage smoothly the changes to the manpower flow, to avoid bottlenecks at various levels of the organisation. Where necessary for operational needs, MHA will offer re-employment to officers who meet eligibility criteria, which includes physical fitness.",2,1300,2022-11-08-T-051-S-01300

For example, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has been using video analytics to pick up abnormal behaviour in prison cells. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has increased the usage of automated clearance facilities by travellers. The Smart Fire Station in Punggol uses sensors and automation to help with manpower management, operational response and decision making.

Growth was supported in part by the recovery in tourism-related and consumer-facing sectors. While growth is projected to slow in the fourth quarter of the year due to weaker external demand, the economy remains on track to grow by 3% to 4% for 2022 as a whole. For 2023, growth is likely to slow further in tandem with the global economy.",2,1313,2022-11-08-T-054-S-01313

For example, to alleviate businesses' cashflow constraints, we have increased the maximum loan quanta of the Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS)-Working Capital Loan and EFS-Trade Loan to $500,000 and $10 million respectively, up from $300,000 and $5 million respectively.",3,1314,2022-11-08-T-054-S-01314

Over the next four years, the Government has set aside $600 million to scale up the Productivity Solutions Grant to support more than 100,000 projects. We also enhanced the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit of up to $10,000 per company to embark on both workforce and enterprise transformation in tandem.
