2022-11-29-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Health in light of the US research paper suggesting that COVID-19 reinfection is more dangerous (a) what is the mortality rate and serious complication rate of those in Singapore catching COVID-19 for a second or third time vis-a-vis a first-time infection; and (b) how does vaccination alter the mortality and severe illness rate in both groups.,1,1,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00001
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Sir, the Member has referred to a US research paper, which according to media reports, found that second COVID-19 infections are more severe compared to first infections.",1,2,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00002
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I am afraid the media reports have not been clear or accurate. The paper cited by the Member does not compare the severity between first-time infections and reinfections. Instead, it compares the outcomes of those who had a first COVID-19 infection, versus those with two or more infections. And therefore, not surprisingly, the study found it is more likely for persons to develop adverse health outcomes after two or more episodes of COVID-19 infection, compared to people who had only one infection episode. Put it simply  getting sick twice is worse than getting sick once; but getting sick for the second time is not worse than getting sick the first time.",2,3,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00003
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In fact, from September to mid-November 2022, the mortality rate of reinfection cases in Singapore was four per 100,000 cases, lower than that for first-time infection cases at 35 per 100,000 cases. The rate of severe illness – those requiring oxygen supplementation, intensive care or death – was also lower for reinfections at 232 per 100,000 cases, compared to first-time infections at 282 per 100,000 cases.",3,4,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00004
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Our data also shows that achieving minimum vaccination protection – in other words, three doses of mRNA or four doses of Sinovac – lowers the risk of severe illness, whether it is a first infection or re-infection.",4,5,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00005
2022-11-29-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Yip.,1,6,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00006
2022-11-29-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister for his clarification. Is there any data that the bivalent vaccine booster has helped to reduce severe illness and death? What is the uptake of the bivalent vaccine? And with the Singapore public treating living with COVID as a new normal, how can we improve the uptake of the bivalent vaccine?",1,7,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00007
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The initial data from clinical trials of the bivalent vaccine and now, empirical data based on our actual lived experience, show that it has been effective in reducing severe illnesses. Today, when you compare, especially for the aged, those who have gotten full protection and up-to-date vaccination, versus those who have not, it still shows a significant difference between the prevalence of severe illness if they get infected. I do not have the data with me, but it is at least four to five times more likely to fall severely ill if you are not fully vaccinated or not update-to-date with the vaccination.",1,8,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00008
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Today, we are administering healthy numbers of vaccines – about 20,000 a day in uptake; it is quite good. This includes both mono-valent and bivalent. I do not have the breakdown, but the take-up has been encouraging for people keeping their vaccination up-to-date. We will continue to put out public messages to encourage people to take their vaccine, keep it up-to-date, because the pandemic is not over. We will be stepping up our mobile vaccination teams into the heartlands so that, especially for the seniors, they will find that it is more accessible to getting their vaccination up-to-date with the mobile vaccination teams in place.",2,9,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00009
2022-11-29-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gan Thiam Poh.,1,10,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00010
2022-11-29-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Speaker. I just want to ask the Minister is there data to show what is the reinfection rate and the seriousness of using mRNA and other vaccines.",1,11,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00011
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Can the Member repeat that? I was not too clear.,1,12,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00012
2022-11-29-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"My question is, is there data to show what is the effective rates of using mRNA and the seriousness of reinfection, and the difference between mRNA vaccine and others, these two categories.",1,13,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00013
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There was a similar Parliamentary Question before and I showed some of the data. The Member should be able to find it in the Hansard. Essentially, for the non-mRNA vaccine, we mostly use Sinovac. Sinovac is effective if you take three or more shots, preferably four shots. It does protect you against severe illness. I remember the protection rate is about 70-plus percent. But if you use mRNA, it is even more effective, at 80-plus, almost 90%.",1,14,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00014
2022-11-29-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, both are effective, with mRNA vaccines having an edge over Sinovac.",2,15,2022-11-29-T-001-S-00015
2022-11-29-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Manpower in the past three years, how many reports have been received from platform firms or platform gig workers regarding injuries suffered in the course of platform or gig work including (i) near-misses (ii) accidents without injury (iii) accidents with injury of any severity and (iv) accidents with injury serious enough to require medical help.",1,16,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00016
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Companies are required to report their employees’ injuries to MOM to facilitate expeditious processing of work injury compensation claims and ensure that the injured employees receive the necessary compensation. Platform workers are currently not covered by mandatory work injury compensation requirements, so platform work injury data is not reported to the Ministry.",1,17,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00017
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Manpower),"The Government has accepted recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Platform Workers, including strengthening financial protection in case of work injury. Upon implementation of the work injury compensation framework for platform workers, the reporting of work injuries for platform workers will be mandated.",2,18,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00018
2022-11-29-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Dr Tan.,1,19,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00019
2022-11-29-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. I have Clementi residents who are delivery riders with platform companies; some have been injured on the job. The General Insurance Association (GIA) recently proposed expanded use of prolonged medical leave insurance and group personal accident insurance instead of Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) framework. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State, why did the insurers and platform companies not suggest this earlier, especially when they already knew that there were riders who were dying on the job?",1,20,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00020
2022-11-29-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Second, does it mean that the GIA proposal will need every company to buy 24-hour insurance coverage for their workers, even if the platform worker is only doing a few hours a day with that particular company? And if so, who is going to pay under the GIA recommendation?",2,21,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00021
2022-11-29-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Thirdly, if the GIA proposal is taken up, is it going to weaken the role of WICA? Will it encourage employers in other sectors to convert their employees into contractors so as to avoid the responsibilities and compensation that come with WICA protection for workers?",3,22,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00022
2022-11-29-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,The Senior Minister of State can respond to the three supplementary questions raised. But just a reminder to Members to limit it to two questions.,1,23,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00023
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Thank you, Speaker. I believe the hon Member must be referring to the statement made by GIA to a Business Times article on 24 November 2022.",1,24,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00024
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Let me just explain that today, some platform companies do provide platform workers with compensation for work injuries, but the coverage is uneven across different platforms and at much lower levels than what employees are entitled to under the WICA. For example, platform companies' coverage for death or permanent disability is largely in the $10,000 to $30,000 range, compared to employees' entitlement under WICA of up to $289,000. That is a significant difference in the magnitude of coverage.",2,25,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00025
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,This is why the Platform Workers Advisory Committee recommended requiring platform companies to provide the same scope and level of work injury compensation as employees' entitlement under WICA. This recommendation is both fair to the employers and to the platform workers. Employers meaning the platform companies.,3,26,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00026
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"It is fair to platform workers because they receive the same work injury compensation protection as other workers exposed to the same job risks, such as employees in related sectors like logistics. It is fair to platform companies because they only need to cover platform workers if they are injured in the course of work. If, for example, the platform worker was injured while running personal errands, the platform company is not responsible to provide compensation. This is no different from employers' responsibility towards their employees under WICA and ensures a level playing field across different companies.",4,27,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00027
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"On the other hand, GIA has suggested requiring companies to purchase prolonged medical leave insurance and group personal accident insurance, in place of WICA. Such insurance policies provide 24/7 coverage and compensation, regardless of whether an injury happen in the course of work. They also use fixed payouts, unlike the WICA mechanism where compensation amount varies based on the worker's total earnings.",5,28,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00028
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"While we welcome platform companies to go above and beyond by providing 24/7 coverage for their workers, the Government should not require them to do so, to provide coverage for injuries that are not as a result of work. Similarly, it would not be right to provide a fixed payout to injured platform workers when platform workers are a diverse group, ranging from those who engage in casual work – perhaps only infrequently and a short number of hours a day – to those who do it on a more full-time basis, on a daily basis.",6,29,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00029
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The Platform Workers Advisory Committee recommended that compensation for platform workers should vary based on workers' earnings, the same way that WICA operates today for injured employees. This is fair to the platform worker and platform company as the amount of compensation would depend on the extent of income lost by the worker due to the injury at work.",7,30,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00030
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked if GIA's suggestions will weaken WICA. I just want to reassure the Member that MOM will ensure that companies do not misclassify workers in order to skirt the requirements under WICA. But indeed, one other important aspect of WICA is that under this legal framework, there is an established mechanism under which companies and workers who object to the insurers' assessment of the claim, can file a dispute. MOM will then oversee a dispute resolution process, to adjudicate and settle the claim. This ensures that claims are resolved fairly in accordance with the WICA framework, without prejudice to the company or the worker.",8,31,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00031
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,GIA's suggestion of using only existing prolonged medical leave insurance or group personal accident insurance in place of WICA would relegate this to private insurance policy whose terms and conditions are dictated by the insurer without a clear mechanism to adjudicate disputes.,9,32,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00032
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"I appreciate why insurers would want more flexibility in how they compensate claims. But to ensure fairness to workers and companies, I do not think we should be leaving it to insurers to be the final arbiter of any disputes in work injury claims. There could well be a conflict of interest in such a scenario.",10,33,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00033
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In the committee's engagement with different groups of platform workers and looking at some of the surveys and studies conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), there is feedback from workers that when they want to claim injury claims from some of these insurers as a result of group personal accident insurance policies they were protected under, they often have to jump through hoops. And some of them find it very difficult to actually get the claims settled. There were some who told us that they gave up filing claims because it was so onerous and they had no place to turn to.",11,34,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00034
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In our engagements with insurers, we were also told that offering prolonged medical leave insurance and group personal accident insurance at the same level of coverage as WICA would result in higher insurance premiums for platform companies, compared to an insurance policy based on the committee's recommended approach. This is not surprising since the scope of coverage for these policies is much wider, on a 24/7 basis.",12,35,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00035
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Thus, GIA's suggestion would result in higher business costs to platform companies, especially since regardless of the type of insurance, platform companies will need to purchase insurance that covers all platform workers, and this includes precisely the group that Dr Tan said – those who only do one hour of work a day on the platform. GIA's statement is in contrary to what insurers have advised the committee.",13,36,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00036
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"GIA also suggested that platform workers could rely on MediShield Life coverage for medical expenses due to work injury. Again, let me reiterate the principle that platform workers should receive the same level of coverage for work injury compensation as employees.",14,37,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00037
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Given that employees are covered for up to $45,000 in medical expenses for work injuries by their employers, there is no reason why platform workers should have to rely on MediShield Life which they pay for using their own MediSave, and consequently, pay part of the medical bills using their MediSave or out-of-pocket cash if they suffer a work injury.",15,38,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00038
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"GIA's suggestion is essentially asking platform workers to pay for their own medical expenses. For these reasons, GIA's proposal is not a viable alternative to the advisory committee's recommendation of requiring platform companies to provide the same scope and level of compensation as employees under WICA. It will lead to either unsustainable premiums for platform companies while work injury compensation for platform workers, they are far below the level of entitlements by employees under WICA.",16,39,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00039
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"I note that The Business Times article which the Member probably referred to – that was published on 24 November – stated that GIA Chief Executive Officer Mr Ho Kai Weng said, "" GIA members firmly believe financial protection for platform workers can be efficiently achieved through the existing solutions compared to the WICA-based solution."" That is the crux of the supplementary question asked by the hon Dr Tan Wu Meng. That is, if it was so viable, why did the insurers and platform companies not suggest this earlier when there were workers who were injured or suffered death while on the job.",17,40,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00040
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Our discussions with insurers showed it was not possible to do so in a cost-effective way. But given the confidence that GIA has on the efficiency of existing products and policies that they have and the public statements by various platform companies that platform workers deserved protection for injuries incurred in the course of their work, I would suggest that GIA members work closely with platform companies to offer financial protection and compensation for these workers at the level of WICA as soon as possible by the first quarter of next year, hopefully, using their existing products while maintaining the cost of premiums at parity with WICA insurance products.",18,41,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00041
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"This will provide better coverage for the workers in the interim and keep costs manageable for platform companies and consumers while we work on implementation details of WICA for this group of workers by the end of 2024. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I would like to reiterate that the committee's recommendations are fair to both platform companies and workers and take a balanced approach to strengthening platform workers' financial protection in case of work injury in a sustainable manner. We look forward to continuing our engagements with platform workers, platform companies and insurers as we work towards implementing these recommendations.",19,42,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00042

The  Senior Minister of State",1,44,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00044
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I thank Mr Liang for working with the committee in the lead-up to the announcement by helping us to also provide avenues to engage to workers. Indeed, these are early days since the recommendations were announced. The early sensing from different stakeholders, workers, companies and consumers showed that it is a positive set of recommendations that is much welcomed. The workers basically welcome the fact that they will now – when it is implemented – have better work injury compensation, much better than they had today under WICA.",1,45,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00045
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"But, of course, the details of implementation are not fully out. So, there are some concerns about whether it will be effectively implemented. For the platform companies, they have put out statements to say that recommendations are fair and balanced and they welcome the changes that will enhance the protection given to these group of workers. So, on the whole, this is very much welcomed.",2,46,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00046
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Our surveys before the release also showed that consumers in various surveys, between 70% and 90% are prepared to pay up to 10% more in prices to make sure that these workers have the adequate protection, so long as the price increase that they pay for goes directly to helping these workers address their income retirement, their retirement adequacy as well as their ability to have housing adequacy.",3,47,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00047
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Generally, the public, the companies and the workers themselves all welcome this set of recommendations.",4,48,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00048
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Specific to the comment that the Member raised about Grab's statement expressing that – excluding street hails from these recommendations would create an unlevel playing field. I would say that, in fact, including street hail into this recommendation would cause an uneven playing field instead. The simple reason is that street hail taxis actually work on a different business model as opposed to a platform model because in the street hail model, the taxi driver is essentially renting the taxi from the taxi companies. The taxi driver decides how he wants to pick up passengers, where he wants to pick up, he can deny working for the day, if he chose to, with no penalties levied by the taxi company. It is more of a rental and rentee kind of relationship.",5,49,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00049
2022-11-29-T-002,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In fact, in a street hail engagement, the passenger pays to the taxi driver directly. The money does not pass through any app platform, it does not go through the taxi company and there is no commission being levied on the amount of fare that the passenger pays to the taxi driver through a street hail. In that sense, the degree of management control is less and perhaps non-existent in this case. And that is why in the deliberation, the committee recommended that platform companies that exert a certain degree of management control on these supposed group of self-employed workers will then need to provide these workers with some degree of basic protection which includes work injury compensation as well as retirement and housing adequacy.",6,50,2022-11-29-T-002-S-00050

I just spent the weekend with the Singapore Teachers' Union talking about the workload and their concerns. Now you are asking to do counselling work as well. And that is why the clarification really is on whether we can increase the support to school counsellors, separate from teacher-counsellors, so teachers can focus on teaching and school counsellors can help the students who really do need that help quite desperately.",1,62,2022-11-29-T-004-S-00062
2022-11-29-T-004,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"We recognise that counselling work is demanding and teacher-counsellors have to balance their teaching and counselling workload. Schools does have the flexibility to reduce teaching or CCA duties for teacher-counsellors to provide them more time to spend with their students if they need to. And training for teacher-counsellors also has been enhanced to equip them not only to support their students' well-being, but also better manage their own well-being. We do that for the school counsellors too. Self-care is also important for the counsellors.",1,63,2022-11-29-T-004-S-00063

2022-11-29-T-005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I thank the Minister of State for her replies. I have got to two supplementary questions. Nowadays, bank accounts are absolutely essential for daily living because if the bank account is frozen, it could severely impact the person's ability to conduct daily transactions like receiving their salary. My first supplementary question is, the Minister of State mentioned that they can apply to conduct some limited transactions, does this include being able to receive their salary into their bank accounts?",1,70,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00070
2022-11-29-T-005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Secondly, can the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and even the Prison Service provide banks with a letter stating that the investigation or conviction against the person has been completed and what the outcome is so the bank will not flag these persons as being high-risk and prevent them from being from using the bank account or opening a bank account.",2,71,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00071
2022-11-29-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Indeed, we recognise that victims of scams require their bank accounts to be able to make daily transactions. We all recognise the importance of having a bank account to facilitate these transactions. I think the difficulty that the Police faces is that during investigations, some of these bank accounts, unfortunately, from the victim's perspective, they are absolutely a victim in the absolute sense.",1,72,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00072
2022-11-29-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"But what has happened to some of these accounts is that they may be also tainted with the sense that scam monies may also have been remitted into these accounts, because when a scam syndicate operates, we often see that monies are transferred from one bank account to another and there is often co-mingling of monies in bank accounts. So, the Police actually has to freeze the relevant bank accounts for the purposes of investigations.",2,73,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00073
2022-11-29-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The Police freezes these bank accounts when there are two instances. Let me just share with you, for instance, where another victim has made a police report and designates a specific bank account as having received their scam monies. So, the victim from your perspective, victim A for instance, may see himself or herself as the victim who has transferred monies out. But actually, if you look at the entire scam syndicates and its operations, this particular victim A's bank account, could have been compromised whereby another victim's monies has been transferred in as well. That is number one.",3,74,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00074
2022-11-29-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Number two, as part of fund tracing investigations, because for instance, in a job scam, it can impact hundreds of persons at the same time. So, as part of tracing the flows of monies, they will have to freeze many bank accounts and you will often see that there are multiple claimants on the specific sums of monies.",4,75,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00075
2022-11-29-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I just wanted to share that this is the background as to why the Police has to freeze bank accounts. For instance, you mentioned where a victim actually requires a bank account to be able to facilitate their transactions, if the bank account is actually frozen, what we would suggest to the victim, is actually for them to open another bank account for the purposes of receiving their salaries, because unfortunately, like I mentioned in my original reply, the time taken for investigations for scams can differ significantly, depending on the complexity of the case. And we do not want to unnecessarily impede the victims' ability to transact on a bank account, so we would typically recommend that they set up a separate bank account, to be able to receive their salaries.",5,76,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00076
2022-11-29-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"On your second point, there are various reasons why a bank account can be blacklisted. A victim, like I mentioned before, they themselves see themselves as a victim in the absolute sense, but unfortunately their bank account has been compromised, it could have been used almost in a sense like a money mule, because monies have been transferred in and out of the account. So, there could be various reasons why an account is blacklisted. The Police would give inputs on whether an investigation has completed to the banks, but the banks will have to make their own assessment as to whether or not to continue to blacklist a particular account holder, when it comes to setting up new bank accounts.",6,77,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00077

I think we are on the same page here, but I understand that once the Police informs the bank that a certain account needs to be frozen, will that impact that account holders' ability to open up another bank account? As in, will the bank flag this person is high-risk and therefore not allow him or her to even open another bank account and so, that would present difficulties for them.",1,79,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00079
2022-11-29-T-005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"So, the purpose or my second supplementary question just now, was then, can MHA provide more information to the banks on the update of the investigations, so that the banks can use that to assess and perhaps, lower the risk level of this particular account holder, so that they can allow them to open up, may be, a limited purpose bank account.",2,80,2022-11-29-T-005-S-00080

The Police will do their very best to provide information to be able to help these victims move on and expedite investigations as much as necessary to be helpful to the victims.

What impact do these multiple car owners have on the price of COEs, considering they not only add to the demand, but because they tend to come from higher-income households, they have the ability to pay more for their COEs. And secondly, has the Ministry considered the possibility of introducing measures to dampen the demand for second and subsequent Category A cars from the same household, so that the limited supply of cars can be spread out more equitably to those who need it most – for example, caregivers and those who need to drive for work.",1,96,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00096
2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song for his question. Firstly, I think the underlying thesis is that somehow this component of the COE ownership is driving price increases. If we look at the facts, the proportion that has been accounted for by households in these various categories has been relatively stable over time. There has not been any major shift in patterns of demand. If anything, in fact, multiple car ownership amongst individuals has shown probably a bit of a declining trend; firstly.",1,97,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00097
2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, in terms of what accounts for the COE prices, whilst we can look for many plausible explanatory factors, the fundamental issue is supply and demand. Demand remains unabated, whereas supply is constrained, because we have a zero-growth policy and the supply is determined by de-registrations – which are in part affected by the 10-year cycle because of the historical pattern of car registrations and also because of current economic environment in people's decisions on the margin – whether they want to de-register or extend their COEs on the cars that they already have.",2,98,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00098
2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, on balance, I would say that it does not necessarily follow that any effort to curb car ownership beyond the first car in any household will necessarily have a dampening effect on COE prices, which is the second point that the Member raised. For two reasons, first, the quantitative impact is unclear as I have just explained; and secondly, because there may be very legitimate reasons why households have a second car or need a second car. So, we have designed a system where the market, based on demand and supply, clears the COEs at a certain price and we need to try not to adjust or affect the fundamentals too much because then it starts to create unintended consequences in the market.",3,99,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00099

2022-11-29-T-008,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I have a quick supplementary question. I accept that the second and third car households have not contributed to the increase in the COE in recent years, but does it add to the baseline of the COE demand. Because it might well be the fact that the number of households with two or more cars has not increased over the years, but 12% is not a small number, so that could also be causing the baseline price of the COE to be high.",1,101,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00101
2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"If I may make two points in response to the Member's questions. First, as I said the percentage has been stable over a period of time, at a time when COE prices were not so high. So, if the baseline argument is to be made, it must be made consistently across a 10-year cycle.",1,102,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00102
2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And the fact is, it is not so much that part of the equation, but more the supply side that has been affecting the overall prices of the COEs because of what we have seen.",2,103,2022-11-29-T-008-S-00103
2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"It is also worth noting that households — because implicit in the Member's question is that multiple car ownership is biased towards higher-income households.

2022-11-29-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, there is a certain equity argument that is being advanced as well.

I have mentioned earlier in my original reply that the families are able to come back to the Social Service Office to renew their applications, even before their applications are due to expire.

I have heard from the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary that the Ministry does not make a distinction in relation to the timelines for the review. My point is whether MSF could consider imposing timelines, or rather, coming up with appropriate timelines, so there is no mismatch in expectations of families getting assistance and the expectations of the Ministry in relation to assessing whether or not continued care and assistance is needed.",1,143,2022-11-29-T-013-S-00143

In terms of documents submission, we are not expecting the family to come back with the full suite of documentation that was needed at first application.

So, we are just a month into it. Prosecutions typically take time, and therefore, I do not have an update, specific to the ACOP.",1,180,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00180
2022-11-29-T-016,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But what I can say is this  today, under section 48 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act, company directors as well as C-suite or senior leaders can already be prosecuted under the law for contraventions or not complying to workplace safety and health measures. ACOP helps us to put an added layer to put more transparency and clearer obligations on managements and boards so that they look after the workplace safety and health of their employees and workers. So, it makes it clearer. And if needed, it makes also clearer for prosecution, for us to prosecute them in Court.",2,181,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00181
2022-11-29-T-016,,,"But let me also give the Member some idea since he asked about what we have done so far with prosecution of board directors and senior leaders. I will take two recent cases. One is the director of Thyme Food & Services who was charged under section 48 of the WSH Act for failure to prevent the offence of the occupier. The director was fined $45,000 while the firm was fined $185,000. So, we do differentiate between firms and directors. In the other case, Leeden National Oxygen Ltd was also charged under the same section 48 of the WSH Act – the ex-CEO for failure to exercise due diligence as CEO. He was fined $45,000 while the firm was fined $340,000. So, these are actual offences which we have prosecuted under the older regime. But, with ACOP, it makes it easier for us to prosecute as the regime is a lot clearer.",1,182,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00182
2022-11-29-T-016,,,"Specific to StartSAFE, I agree with the Member that beyond just enforcement and penalties, it is also important for us to inculcate that culture and mindset of workplace safety among leaders and businesses. So, if we look at StartSAFE, we have brought in more than 140 companies, in fact, that have signed up since September and October this year since we started the heightened safety period. This is close to 50% higher than what we typically got monthly before this. So, there is, indeed, higher demand.",2,183,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00183
2022-11-29-T-016,,,"But, certainly, if you ask me whether it can still be better, this is where I seek the help of the unions, for example, and employers and trade associations, to encourage more companies, because this is fully funded by the Government for SMEs. And SMEs have also been shown to have a higher incidence of fatalities and major injuries this year. So, we want to inculcate and bring more on board as much as we can.",3,184,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00184
2022-11-29-T-016,,,"Since the launch of ACOP as well, we have also now engaged various industry associations and companies, particularly to promote the adoption of ACOP principles and measures. So, what we will be doing next is to develop online resources on ACOP and incorporate ACOP into bizSAFE level 1 by the first quarter of 2023. So, we are going to institutionalise ACOP into our bizSAFE certification programmes and, therefore, I hope we will get more firms on board as we formalise it as well.",4,185,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00185

2022-11-29-T-016,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his further clarifications. We are about three months into the heightened safety period. Can the Senior Minister of State share if this period and the measures have helped to improve the workplace safety situation across the various industries and are there any plans to extend the heightened safety period beyond 28 February 2023?",1,187,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00187
2022-11-29-T-016,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his follow-up question on the heightened safety period. To recap, MOM introduced a slew of measures to strengthen WSH as part of our heightened safety period from 1 September this year to 28 February next year. So, this is really to target egregious companies with serious or fatal workplace accidents. To date, I think we have had some promising results or outcomes so far. Prior to 1 September, we were having about 4.5 fatal accidents per month, on average. After the heightened safety alert was implemented, we have about two fatalities per month. So, we have slowed down the momentum. I hope it continues. I think there is greater awareness among firms. But again, we should move towards zero because every fatality is just one too many.",1,188,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00188
2022-11-29-T-016,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"To date, more than 30 companies were also required to engage external auditors to conduct a thorough review of the WSH processes following the issuance of stop-work orders during the heightened safety period. So, in addition, two companies Le Fong Building Service and Green Cycling were debarred from employing new foreign workers for up to three months and their CEOs had to personally account to MOM to take responsibility for rectifications. So, this also shows the change in posture that we are taking now, to make leaders, CEOs, a lot more accountable for fatalities and major injuries in their workplaces. Another the heightened safety period, MOM also called for mandatory safety timeout to be completed by 30 September 2022 and we are enforcing it as we move along with inspections.",2,189,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00189
2022-11-29-T-016,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"To the Member's question whether this will be extended, the heightened safety period is still ongoing. So, let us review it. The initial outcomes, as I have shared, have slowed down the momentum of fatalities. So, I think that is a good sign and we hope that continues. But it is still too early to say. Let us wait till March next year and then we will decide after we see the total outcome of the whole period.",3,190,2022-11-29-T-016-S-00190

2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mr Speaker, the income ceilings for the purchase of subsidised HDB flats and Executive Condominiums, or ECs, are reviewed regularly to ensure that public housing remains within reach of the majority of citizen households and that housing subsidies are given to those who need them most. Factors that are considered include the household incomes of Singaporeans and prevailing housing market conditions, among others. We are also mindful that lower-income households could be crowded out by an adjustment to the income ceilings.",1,192,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00192
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for National Development),"The income ceiling was last reviewed in 2019, when it was raised from $12,000 to $14,000 for families buying a new flat, and from $14,000 to $16,000 for families buying an EC from property developers. At the same time, we introduced the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant, or the EHG, to better support lower- to middle-income families buying their first homes.",2,193,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00193
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for National Development),"There are no plans to revise the income ceilings at this point. At the current income ceiling of $14,000, about eight in 10 Singaporeans are eligible to apply for a BTO flat, while the $16,000 ceiling enables about nine in 10 Singaporeans to apply for EC. There is no income restriction for the purchase of a resale HDB flat on the open market.",3,194,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00194

2022-11-29-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Thank you, Speaker and I thank Minister Indranee for the comprehensive reply. The real income of Singaporeans may not increase this year and next year because of high inflation. But their nominal income will likely increase if inflation stays high at 5% this year, and probably next year at 10%. So, does this not affect only the income ceilings of application of BTO flats but also affect Singaporeans' income criteria eligibility for Enhanced Housing Grant, which means that $1,500 now get $80,000 of EHG, a lot of them may exceed $1,500 because of the increase in nominal income but not the real nominal income?",1,197,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00197
2022-11-29-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"My second supplementary question is that in 2010, the income ceiling for HDB BTO flats and the EC, the differential is $2,000 – that is, the difference between $8,000 and $10,000. Today, the gap remains at $2,000. But in 2010, the differential was 25%. Today, the gap is 14%. And the average price of, say, a 3-bedroom EC, as compared to a, HDB 4-room flat, is probably more than double. So, could the Second Minister consider these two considerations?",2,198,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00198
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I also understand his concern, which is about affordability and accessibility for HDB housing for the majority of Singaporeans. What HDB and MND do is to look at it as a whole, not just one lever or one particular measure in isolation. Overall, what we are trying to do is to look at the demand as well as the supply which, of course, in the pandemic years, has been somewhat constrained.",1,199,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00199
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, to ensure that public housing remains affordable and accessible, one of our current priorities is to rein in the strong upward momentum in HDB resale prices. To this end, as the Member knows, we have rolled out additional measures in September 2022 to moderate demand and ensure prudent borrowing amidst rising interest rates. And then to moderate demand for resale flats, MND and HDB introduced the 15-month wait-out period for private property owners and ex-private property owners to buy a non-subsidised HDB resale flat. Raising the income ceiling at this juncture may negate the efforts to cool the resale market as it would enable the higher-income households to bid up resale prices further.",2,200,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00200
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Our other priority is to ramp up the supply of new flats to meet the strong demand for public housing. Thus, any review to raise the income ceiling would also have to be balanced against greater competition for the finite resources of the Government.",3,201,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00201
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, in short, what we are really saying is this. We understand the concerns. We know that Singaporeans are keen to buy their HDB flats. On MND and HDB side, we will do our utmost to ensure that they remain affordable and accessible. Tweaking the income ceiling, in and of itself, may not necessarily be the best measure. We will look at it overall and see how we can maintain that accessibility and affordability.",4,202,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00202

2022-11-29-T-017,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"I was also asking about the income criteria to qualify for the various levels of the Enhanced Housing Grant and other housing grants. So, with the increase of the nominal income, you put a lot of people at a disadvantage that they cannot qualify for the higher housing grant. That is the question. That is the first supplementary question. The second supplementary question is about the differential in gap between the HDB BTO income ceiling as well as the EC income ceiling. The gap of $2,000 is quite different between today, which is a 14% difference, as compared to 2010 when it was a 25% difference. So, two different questions. I hope the Second Minister can answer the two questions.",1,204,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00204
2022-11-29-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In so far as the grant is concerned, if the concern is whether or not their housing grant can be increased, that is something we can look at and make a separate decision because they are two separate things. So, if the Member is asking, today, can I say that we will increase the income ceiling, the answer is there are no plans to do that at this stage. If the Member is saying whether we can increase the grants, that is something we can look at. But, overall, the key message to the Member and to Singaporeans is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that housing remains affordable and accessible.",1,205,2022-11-29-T-017-S-00205

Higher profits in good years help the energy companies smooth out past losses and prepare for future downcycles. Windfall taxes arbitrarily applied to companies just because of their recent “record profits” will lead to considerable business uncertainty and disincentivise long-term private investments.

For them, were such marriages to become recognised, they – perhaps paradoxically – would feel that society is not only no longer representative of who they are, but some may even go as far as to feel that it has turned against them.

2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"First, on the repeal of section 377A. I will start with a quick story. I once asked two friends – husband and wife, in their 30s, young parents to two kids and we were talking about their expectations of their children. And I asked them, what if their son turns out to be gay, and wishes to bring his partner home to meet them, what would they think? Without missing a beat, they replied to me, they cannot even begin to contemplate and imagine such a scenario.",12,321,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00321
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"I do not think they belong to a minority of young parents today. Far from it. Yet, if their son does turn out to be gay, I would make a guess that they will  one, love him all the same; and two, they will certainly not want their son, and his acts of intimacy with his partner, consensual, in private, to be labelled as criminal. Why should their son be labelled a criminal?",13,322,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00322
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"This, I think, is the crux of the section 377A issue. Regardless of our views on homosexuality, I think we can generally agree that we know a gay friend or even family member, and we love and respect him like we do any other friend or family member, and we have very little reason, really, to see him as a criminal.",14,323,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00323
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"I believe this is the prevailing morality of our society. And because our laws ought to reflect the morality of our society, repealing section 377A and decriminalising gay sex is really the right thing for us to do. I am glad we are doing it.",15,324,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00324
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"We could very well stop here. Legislatively, there is no obligation or inevitability that as we decriminalise gay sex, we will also protect the institution of marriage. It is a deliberate act of Parliament, a carefully considered and balanced decision and move, to do both at the same time. And we do it, because we know that taken together, this set of arrangements would be one that our society, as a whole, can probably accept, and it can point a way forward for all of us.",16,325,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00325
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Going back to the story of my two friends, the young parents. Yes, if their son does turn out to be gay, they will certainly not want their son's private activities to be criminal, but I think it will be much less certain if they will accept the notion of a son-in-law, or of a grandchild, or grandchildren, within the context of such a marriage between their son and his gay partner.",17,326,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00326
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And I think they would also completely understand if their friends were to turn to them and say  look, we really will not agree to allowing your son to marry here in Singapore, because it runs against our beliefs and it runs against what we would like our children and grandchildren to believe about marriage, or at least, what we would like our children and grandchildren to see and hear for themselves before forming their own conclusions.",18,327,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00327
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"On marriage, I think, this is the prevailing morality of our society, and our laws and policies should also protect this, even as we repeal the law on gay sex.",19,328,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00328
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Indeed, it seems, from a survey conducted by TODAY just two months ago, that younger Singaporeans generally think this way too. Sixty-eight percent view the repeal of 377A positively and at the same time, an almost equal proportion wishes to uphold the current definition of marriage between one man and one woman.",20,329,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00329
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Let me also say this. Some have commented that where we are today is effectively one step forward and two steps back for the gay community. I have to respectfully disagree. I think this is real progress. Gay sex is decriminalised in Singapore, finally. At the same time, we are coming together as a society and coming to terms with the reality that a majority of us are not yet ready to give up our fundamental beliefs including on marriage and so, let us find a balance, let us find mutual accommodation. This is a mark of our maturing society. This is real progress.",21,330,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00330
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Some, on the other hand, have characterised the repeal as a capitulation by the Government – and society at large – to the relentless campaigns and militant advocacy of some gay rights activists. I think this is quite unfair too. I believe, instead, that this change is about all of us, our society as a whole, maturing, progressing organically.",22,331,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00331
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Change takes time – and this has taken quite some time – but this change has not been precipitated by the narrow words or actions or deeds of a few.

I have a partner. I want to bring him to see you”. What would you say? What would you think?",24,333,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00333
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"It may be a difficult problem and I do not wish any parent to go through this test. But, if this is the reality, then I guess that our first response should be that our love for our children remains the same. In addition, we would not wish the son to be considered a criminal because of his sexual orientation.",25,334,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00334
2022-11-29-T-019,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"This second point is the crux of section 377A of the Penal Code. Regardless our attitude towards homosexuality, we would have homosexual friends or even family members in life. Like anyone else, they deserve to be loved and respected. I think we can also agree that we have no reason to regard their sexual life in private as a criminal offence. It is inhumane and unfair. I therefore support the repeal of section 377A. This is what we should do as an inclusive society. This is our duty.",26,335,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00335

These concerns are fundamental and important, and it is precisely because of this that together with repealing section 377A, the Government is also proposing to amend the Constitution to protect the current definition of marriage. Yesterday, Minister of State Sun Xueling pointed out that the Government has put in a lot of efforts to address the issue of section 377A and the concerns of various groups in society.",28,337,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00337

Others have shared that removing criminality from homosexuality is long overdue, given that the law was introduced back in 1938. Some have also questioned if there is actually a real possibility of 377A being struck out by the Courts, while others have also worried about the wider ripples of this repeal, whether this has potential to change the way that marriage is defined in Singapore or how sexuality education will be taught to their children.",3,349,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00349

Almost seven in 10, or 68%, of youths polled said that the repeal of section 377A of the Penal Code, which criminalises sex between homosexuals, is positive for inclusivity in Singapore. But when asked if same-sex marriage is wrong, the respondents were generally divided, with 37% agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statement, and 33% disagreeing or strongly disagreeing. The remaining said that they were neutral. At the same time, 62% of the respondents felt that it was important to uphold and safeguard the definition of marriage as that between a man and a woman.""",7,476,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00476
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"There have been various polls done over time and, while they may not all be statistically significant, I believe they do sufficiently tell the story. First, that Singaporeans are sympathetic towards decriminalising gay sex; two, Singaporeans are divided on the acceptance of same-sex relations; and three, the majority of Singaporeans, both young and old, believe that it is important to uphold and safeguard the definition of marriage as that between a man and a woman.",8,477,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00477
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"After much prayer, research and listening to many, including my own daughters, repealing section 377A is the right thing to do, and doing so will send a statement to the LGBTQ+ community that they are safe being who they are, even if their behaviour may not be accepted by the mainstream community in Singapore.",9,478,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00478
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Supporting the repeal is not the issue. As many in the House have said, the removal of anti-gay sex laws in some countries saw the issue of same-sex marriage falling under the spotlight and there are large segments in Singapore who care deeply about marriage as defined currently between a man and a woman, as well as family norms, such as how children are brought up and what is taught in school. Most people have come to accept that gay sex is a matter of private individual choice.",10,479,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00479
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Same-sex marriage, however, is effectively changing a social institution, contrary to what most Singaporeans believe and are ready to accept. For me, marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman, committing fidelity to each other, so long as they both shall live, and bringing forth children to form a family and fulfil the natural order of the transmission of life.",11,480,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00480
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"In fact, this Parliament has declared 2022 as the Year of Singapore Families. Singapore families want to be confident that, in Singapore, we will be able to freely guide our children on what we believe to be right and wrong. Likewise, for us Catholics, the Catholic Church needs to be confident that their rights to preach and to teach in the parishes and Catholic schools, according to Catholic beliefs, will be protected. As we have heard in these past two days, the same is true for other religious communities and even for non-religious Singaporeans.",12,481,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00481
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister to clarify a few points to help address concerns and worries in the minds and hearts of Singaporeans, even as we move to support the repeal of section 377A.",13,482,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00482

2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Second, will the Christian and Catholic Churches be assured that they will continue to be free to preach against gay sexual acts? Cardinal William Goh has spoken of his concerns that we may be drawn into a situation as in the West, where we cannot even say that a same-sex relationship is wrong. For the Catholic Church, this would not be acceptable as the Church must have freedom to continue to teach in the Catholic schools and from the pulpit what we believe, and practise what we teach.",15,484,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00484
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Third, how will MOE handle sexuality education in our schools, both public and private, and assure Singaporeans that Singapore's family and social norms, based on traditional Singaporean values, will be protected? Bullying and cancel culture must not take root in our educational institutions and our society.",16,485,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00485
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Fourth, we should not allow a culture where people of religion are ostracised, attacked for espousing their views or their disagreements with LGBTQ+ viewpoints and vice versa. Singapore has worked hard to create inter-religious harmony in our society. How will the Government protect and safeguard this precious strength and asset of our country?",17,486,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00486
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Let me close by reiterating my desire that after today's Bills are carried, the LGBTQ+ community amongst us will feel reaffirmed that they are safe being who they are, and, together, all of us, as Singaporeans, we will rise above differences in views and beliefs, and respect one another's dignity as human persons. We will work together to prevent cancel culture to take root in our educational institutions, our workplaces and our society.",18,487,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00487
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),We will maintain our religious freedom to practise and teach what we believe to be right and wrong. We will uphold Singapore's societal norms where marriage is a union between a man and a woman and that married couples live as role models for their children and children's children. And we will not disregard the importance and essential need to have the holistic family as the bedrock of our society.,19,488,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00488
2022-11-29-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"And finally, we will continue to dialogue, to listen with compassion and kindness, to one another.

2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Despite the Government having said multiple times in the past that it will not enforce the colonial era law, and with the Court of Appeal ruling earlier this year that section 377A was unenforceable in its entirety, its existence has very real repercussions that affect many of our fellow Singaporeans, their families and their loved ones.",2,492,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00492
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The topic of this debate is a complex and multi-faceted one, with individuals, including Members of Parliament, holding deep personal convictions. Yet, beyond the Bills and clauses themselves, we must also be cognisant that the issues we are debating have far-reaching effects into the personal lives of our fellow Singaporeans. It is on this note that I wish to touch on some aspects of the lived experience of our LGBTQ+ community in Singapore, which may be less apparent to those of us who are not from within the community.",3,493,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00493
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I am a young father, with a loving and happy family. Section 377A never really bothered me in any way that I live my life. But over the years, I have gotten to know several members of the LGBTQ+ community, some of whom have become my close friends. The daily struggles they face regarding their sexual orientation and gender identity are very real. We all live in a largely heteronormative world. For my LGBTQ+ friends, that means they constantly face subtle judgement, discrimination, apathy and hatred, even towards them at home, at school, in the military and at work.",4,494,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00494
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Seemingly nondescript questions of ""bring your girlfriend to drink next time"" or ""where is your husband?"" or ""do you plan to have kids"" can come up suddenly at family gatherings or happy hour drinks at work and make them squirm. Think about those awkward Chinese New Year conversations that you have with distant relatives at various stages of your life, be it when you are single, married but without children, or even married with one child, and replicate it throughout the rest of the year.",5,495,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00495
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"These questions become even more damaging, especially when they are unsure of how others will react to their true sexual orientation or gender identity, and potentially affect their opportunities at work and in society. So, some choose to hide their true selves and avoid talking about who they are dating or their hopes and dreams to lead a stable life. They stay hidden from society. Some choose to be public about it but fear the risk of being punished for their choices by not being considered for promotion at work or being bullied at school. In some form or another, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ have to cope with additional mental and emotional stress and, in some cases, physical abuse, just for being someone they were born as.",6,496,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00496
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, it has been well-documented that LGBTQ+ individuals are at a higher risk of depression and mental and physical health dangers. Some suffer from internalised homophobia, where they loathe themselves over a sexual orientation or gender identity that they had no choice over.",7,497,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00497
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"A recent NUS public health survey found that among 570 sexual minority young adults aged 18 to 25, 59% had contemplated suicide and 14% had attempted to kill themselves. Having section 377A in our laws means that it is hard to organise support groups to help not just members of the gay community, which is who the laws target, but also the wider LGBTQ+ community, who face discrimination, bullying or mental struggles, just for being who they are.",8,498,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00498
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Schools and companies may think twice about setting up official LGBTQ+ groups, or at least show overt support in counselling and supporting these individuals. Let us not forget the unfortunate incident from earlier this year, where a school counsellor himself presented content discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community, before being suspended from all duties pending investigations. The fact that there remains a legal route for prosecuting LGBTQ+ persons has a specific state-sanctioned chilling effect on the community.",9,499,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00499
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Retaining 377A also makes Singapore look anachronistic, especially in light of our Asian financial hub status. Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed legislation decriminalising homosexual acts in 1991. China repealed similar laws in 1997. Japan briefly made homosexuality illegal and then repealed the law during the Meiji era. Homosexual acts were never a legal issue in Taiwan. India, which also shares similar colonial roots as Singapore, struck the law down in 2018. Having section 377A made it challenging to convince prominent members of the LGBTQ+ community – Singaporean or otherwise – in the arts, financial sector, tech and many other areas to remain in Singapore and make meaningful contributions to our society and economy. The LGBTQ+ community's joy of seeing section 377A repealed would have been even greater if not for the fact that the move merely puts Singapore more in line with other cosmopolitan, open and inclusive societies.",10,500,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00500
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In addition, retaining a law that is not actively enforced or cannot be enforced sends a confusing signal on how one should comprehend Singapore's legal system. It also means that there is always a chance that a future Government may attempt to prosecute a man for sex with another man that was done in private and consensual. That is why I applaud the Government's move to repeal section 377A.",11,501,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00501

2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, the issue of repealing, at its core, is not a political one but one that grants dignity and freedom to a marginalised section of Singapore. I am glad to see that society is, indeed, ready to move on and repeal section 377A. But repealing section 377A does not mean discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community disappears overnight. Discrimination against such individuals still exists in Hong Kong, China, Japan, India and many other jurisdictions where gay sex is not illegal per se.",13,503,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00503
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"On the constitutional amendment that is being proposed, the message that Singapore sends is quite clear  the idea that marriage is only between a man and a woman and this is a decision that will be left for the legislature and society to decide, and not by the Courts. For the geographies that I mentioned earlier that have repealed discriminatory same-sex laws, that discrimination still exists is a reminder to us that social acceptance is crucial to any landmark legal or constitutional changes, to maintain harmony and stability in society. As such, I do recognise the importance of the signal the new Article 156 sends, to provide greater protection for the definition of marriage and its related policies today.",14,504,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00504
2022-11-29-T-019,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"After the Prime Minister's announcement at the National Day Rally, MCI said that media policies on homosexuality will remain, which means, as a Toy Story Fan who has enjoyed the entire Toy Story series since 1995, I cannot bring my children to watch Lightyear, a Pixar animated children's film due to ""overt homosexual depictions"", as though homosexuality is unspeakable and cannot be seen. MOE said that the education curriculum will still be focused on what the majority of society supports, which is family, between a man and a woman.

What was particularly heart-wrenching to me was hearing her speak so casually about the difficulties her parents had in searching for a kindergarten for her back in the 1990s, as they faced repeated rejections the moment the kindergartens found out that she had a disability. She shared that there was even one day when she was not feeling well and threw up after lunch, yet her teacher did not help to clean her up. But she felt that had she been any other normal child, her teachers would have cleaned her up before her parents came to pick her.",18,508,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00508

At home, she was worried that her parents, in particular, would take this news badly.

As an only son, he has been extremely filial to his parents and shares a very special bond with them. A number of years ago, he felt that he no longer wanted to hide his sexuality from his parents and wanted to be completely honest with them as he has been with every other aspect of his life. This was not taken very well unfortunately, with his mother feeling distraught that there was something wrong with her son and even prays at the temple regularly with the hope that, one day, he will be ""normal"" again.

Many financial institutions encourage their employees to bring their true selves to work, because they believe that only then can they truly be engaged in what they do and fully develop their passions. Many banks see being open about being who you are can make for a more productive workforce. They have clear DEI – or diversity, equity and inclusion – talent policies. Incorporating DEI into business operations has proven to benefit companies' performance because it encourages a wider range of views and opinions among staff. All these have clear, measurable impact and should equally apply to our country and economy, too, where we place a very strong emphasis on developing everyone's potential.",22,512,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00512

Similarly, a Deloitte survey of 600 members of the LGBTQ+ community across 12 countries showed that over 70% of the respondents are more inclined to remain with their current employer because of its approach to inclusiveness, while 37% of respondents indicate that they are actively considering changing employers to find one with a more inclusive culture.",23,513,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00513

2022-11-29-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I will share that, in a Youth Network dialogue session, which I attended shortly after the National Day Rally this year, almost the full hall of youth audience between the ages of 15 and 35, raised their hands in support of the repeal of section 377A. On further dialogue, I learned that most youths are of the view that a law that will not be enforced is better off removed. I understand the views of the youths.",11,527,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00527
2022-11-29-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"But what touched me most in that session were a few young adults, who shared that they regretted being too quick to judge and being insensitive in their teenage years when some peers struggled with their sexual identity in their puberty years. With more maturity now, they felt that they could have been more supportive. One even contacted me for opportunities in social service agencies to serve as a counsellor for the homosexual individuals who may be in need, like how we would have helped any other individuals who are in need in Singapore.",12,528,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00528

2022-11-29-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"As we propose the repeal of section 377A in our Penal Code and amend our Constitution for the Parliament of the day to be able to reflect our majority electorate's values on the definition of families in Singapore, let us do so with always a care for our fellow Singaporeans at heart, no matter how diverse we are.",14,530,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00530
2022-11-29-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, I struggled with my speech for many months, like many hon Parliamentarians who have spoken out in these two days of Debate. In the end, it was the reconciliation of my mind, of the duty I have as a Parliamentarian, and my heart, which holds respect and care for people, that I accept the need for the repeal and the important amendments to our Constitution, which will leave space for us as a people to continue to forge understanding, reconciliation and a future together.",15,531,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00531

2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Given proactive steps taken by the Government on stakeholder engagements, including the Minister's explanation yesterday on the historical context of relevant laws, I fully understand the implications of the Court's rulings and judgments. I welcome the Government's clear explanation of the legal risk that the colonial-era 377A faces and the potential domino impact on other parts of our legislation and related policies. I accept Minister Shanmugam's interpretation on this issue.",2,534,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00534
2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I also fully agree that it is the responsibility of our Government and this House to address this issue head on. We cannot cop out and pass this uncomfortable duty to the judiciary. Both Minister Masagos and Minister Shanmugam spoke of the perils of court-led decisions, where the US Supreme Court controversially reversed 50 years of federal abortion rights. The US media noted the chaos brought about by the court judgment to a great nation already split by deep political divide. Singapore cannot afford to take this path.",3,535,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00535
2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"As the debate on this topic can be divisive, I am glad that our Government has taken accountability and has taken steps to help us navigate this complex matter in an inclusive and transparent way, where views from different segments of our society are heard.",4,536,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00536
2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I, too, can attest to this process, where after the National Day Rally Speech, we discussed this issue at Nee Soon's events with our grassroots leaders, residents and religious organisations. We did so in a cool-headed manner and I have to say, the discussions we had with a lot of understanding and empathy. It was way calmer than I earlier expected as this issue is an especially difficult one for all of us to speak on.",5,537,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00537
2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"This topic affects many in the community who are our friends, relatives and colleagues from both gay and traditional families. While majority of Singaporeans do not want to criminalise sex between gay men, residents I spoke to are concerned whether the repeal of section 377A will lead to an erosion of the protection for marriage, family and children and if the underlying motives of past legal challenges go beyond mere removal of stigma and criminalisation.",6,538,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00538
2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I note that the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, which safeguards the definition of marriage without tying the hands of future generations, is a balanced approach to allow the Government of the day to consider prevailing societal attitudes.",7,539,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00539

2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"As the premise for the repeal of section 377A is that what happens in private should not be criminalised, the concern of the community is that this could be incorrectly viewed as a signal for stronger public advocacy of gay relationships.",11,543,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00543
2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"We need to remember that the debate will not make this issue any less divisive.

2022-11-29-T-019,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"On this note, can the Minister explain his thoughts on further mechanisms that the Government will put in place to promote genuine, healthy engagements? Will surveys be done regularly and discussed over national conversations?

Then Archbishop, now Cardinal William Goh spoke of the Roman Catholic Church's neutrality on the repeal, provided that the church continues to have the freedom to teach what it believes and practise what it teaches.

So, Articles 156(1) and (2) have been drafted in to give effect to this principle, to protect the laws and policies, based on that definition and to make it clear that passing laws and having policies based on the current definition of marriage are constitutionally valid. They give context to Articles 156(3) and (4).",15,593,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00593

2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),Mr Murali Pillai asked why is it necessary for Articles 156(3) and (4) to exclude the whole of Part 4 instead of just a few Articles.,18,596,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00596
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),Let us look at Article 156(3)(a) first. This protects the heterosexual definition of marriage itself from invalidation by Part 4. We need to exclude the whole of Part 4 because we cannot predict what possible arguments might be made against this definition in the future.,19,597,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00597
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"With section 377A, we have seen how the arguments in our Courts progressed from equal protection under Article 12 to asserting that sexual conduct is a form of liberty protected by Article 9 or a form of expression protected by Article 14.",20,598,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00598
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Some of these alternative arguments have been accepted by courts in other countries. It is possible that additional creative arguments could be made about the heterosexual definition of marriage. For example, could marriage be a form of association that is protected by Article 14? Members may think it is a little outside of the orthodox interpretation today, but can you rule it out?",21,599,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00599
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Thus, if we want to properly protect the heterosexual definition of marriage from Court challenge, we have to exclude the whole of Part 4.",22,600,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00600
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),But it is not a carte blanche. What is protected is quite precise. It is the heterosexual definition of marriage. That is because just as we have been clear about repealing section 377A – we took a clear position – we are equally clear; this Government is very clear – that we will protect the heterosexual marriage as a key institution in our society. That is why the Constitution is being amended.,23,601,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00601
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"But let me digress and say, as we say all this, as we listen to the speeches by Members on families, let us also not forget, let us also acknowledge that LGBT persons also have and come from families.

2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),But I also outlined a second reason to repeal section 377A – the significant legal risk of it being struck down by the Courts if we were to leave section 377A alone and the significant negative and disruptive consequences for Singaporeans and Singapore if that were to happen.

People would know the arguments. And, Ireland, much more recently.",8,709,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00709
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I was not in the House at that point in time and I do not think we should draw conclusions from the fact that one or another Member was present or was not present. But I would be careful if I were Mr Singh to bring Mr Lee Kuan Yew into this and suggest that he had somehow acted dishonourably.,9,710,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00710
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,If Mr Singh can remind me of his second question?,10,711,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00711
2022-11-29-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,It was about the LGBTQ question vis-à-vis the PAP's position as to whether the LGBTQ community would not be a victim of some personal attacks.,1,712,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00712
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think Mr Singh mentioned  paedophilia. Again, I do not recall the facts. So, I can only answer in hypotheticals.

2022-11-29-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"This was the statement that was released by the PAP. ""What is its agenda? A video has been posted on the Internet showing Vincent Wijeysingha participating at the forum which discussed the promotion of the gay cause in Singapore."" I do not think there is a problem with that statement. And thereafter it says, ""The discussion at the forum also touched on sex with boys and whether the age of consent for boys should be 14 years of age."" The innuendo I think is clear.",3,717,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00717
2022-11-29-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"In the video, Mr Wijeysingha was introduced as being from the SDP. In addition to other comments, Wijeysingha stated, ""I think the gay community has to rally ourselves. Perhaps, one outcome of today's forum would be for those of us who are interested to come together to further consider how we can address the 377 issue as well as further rights issues in relation to gays and lesbians.""",4,718,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00718

But what is the relevance of that point on sex with boys, if not to cast aspersions on the candidate himself and to suggest that. Did he make that point? Was this a forum where this was the only issue that was discussed? So, that was intentionally included. That is my view of the statement.",5,719,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00719
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope we do not have to go into an extended discussion on this. Mr Singh started out the second question by saying that paedophilia was talked about. Let me make it clear to him. If there is a candidate who is standing for elections, whether for the PAP – and I hope the PAP will never field such a candidate – or for the Workers' Party or SDP. And if there is a suggestion of paedophilia, I will certainly speak about it and I am sure all right-thinking Singaporeans will speak about it and will say it is not acceptable.",1,720,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00720
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, I do not quite know the precise context.

2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As the Workers' Party trooped into Parliament yesterday, there was one point. And that point is  Mr Singh, Sir, as Leader of the Opposition, was not prepared for his party to take a position. That is what we are talking about; not about an election held in 2011. We are talking about 2022. What is our position on section 377A? And whether we come here prepared to take a position or we are abdicating.",4,723,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00723

2022-11-29-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,But the question I asked was  what is the PAP's position with regard to LGBTQ+ candidates standing in general elections? I do not think that question has been answered.,2,727,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00727
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It appears to me that, as usual, Mr Singh wants to move the goalpost and start an entirely new debate about who can and who will stand for elections. I am not the Prime Minister or the Secretary-General of the party, but my personal view is that anyone who is not a criminal and who is of good character and of sound mind and who can work for the residents ought to be able to stand for elections. In all of this, in a democracy, it also depends on how people are perceived and accepted in society. All of these are relevant considerations. One has got to look at individual candidates.",1,728,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00728
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But Mr Singh started out by talking about paedophilia. I am sure the records, the Hansard, will show that. And that is why I answered. Because I was shocked that he would even ask that question.",2,729,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00729

2022-11-29-T-019,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),I wish to clarify that our position on wanting the definition of marriage to be determined via a national referendum instead of Parliament is not a convenient way to avoid difficult decisions. A case in point would be the fact that we do have a position on section 377A which is also a difficult one.,2,734,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00734
2022-11-29-T-019,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),We are aware of the Government's position on what the criteria are for holding a referendum. It is just that we have a slightly different view on what are the issues that should go for a referendum.,3,735,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00735
2022-11-29-T-019,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"In this particular case on the issue of the definition of marriage, we feel that this is an issue that is important to many Singaporeans and there is a high level of interest from the public to have a say in this matter. And since it is an area that does not require any specialised knowledge – which would otherwise make it unsuitable for participation from members of the public – and actually, marriage, as many Members have pointed out, is a matter of social norm, we feel that this is an area that is suitable for the public to participate.",4,736,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00736
2022-11-29-T-019,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for the clarification. But I think the most important question is not the referendum. It is what is the PSP's position on the constitutional amendment. Are they for or against it? And, therefore, when the referendum, if held, are they for or against it?",1,737,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00737
2022-11-29-T-019,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,"Okay. As far as the vote for the constitutional amendment is concerned, we will be voting no, because of what I have explained earlier, that we would like the definition of marriage to be via referendum, rather than through Parliament.",1,738,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00738
2022-11-29-T-019,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, that has come out in the open. So, we know that they are going to support the repeal of section 377A, but they will not support that the amendment to the Constitution be made.",1,739,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00739
2022-11-29-T-019,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Their position means that while now there would be no further challenges to section 377A because it does not exist, there will now be new challenges that will be put up in Court on constitutional grounds that other institutions, like marriage and families, important to many Singaporeans, will now stand before the Court. And then we are back to square one again. We have to, reactively again, come to make a decision or wait for the Court to make that decision.",2,740,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00740

2022-11-29-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I wish to make four points if I may, three are clarifications for the Minister for Home Affairs and one is a clarification on my position on the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.",1,744,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00744
2022-11-29-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Let me go to the clarifications for Minister for Home Affairs. Yesterday, during his Second Reading speech, he cited many Court challenges to the constitutionality of section 377A. We are all aware of them. But I do not believe any of the Ministers cited any Court challenges to the heterosexual definition of marriage. So, I would like to ask the Government, whether there has been any Court challenge to the heterosexual definition of marriage. And to that extent, would he not agree with me that his analogy of the oncoming train applies to section 377A, but does not quite apply to the heterosexual definition of marriage?",2,745,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00745
2022-11-29-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second clarification, earlier he mentioned that the Government does not believe that their policies violate the Constitution. I would like to ask him, without Article 156 being enacted, is the Government not confident that it can convince a Court that marriage, based on heterosexual definition, is based on reasonable criteria? It serves the purpose of promoting procreation within a family unit under AMLA, under Women's Charter; and therefore, the Government is on much stronger footing on the constitutionality of the heterosexual definition of marriage, compared to section 377A. That is my belief anyway.",3,746,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00746
2022-11-29-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third clarification is, I would like to ask the Minister to confirm that he accepts that the Courts have a constitutional role to ensure that Parliament's laws and Government actions do conform with the Constitution. I would like his confirmation on that.",4,747,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00747
2022-11-29-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And lastly, Sir, my clarification for the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, I did say that I am not opposing the Bill, but I am abstaining. And the reason I am abstaining is that I have concern about the role of the Courts having judicial oversight over the legality of Government actions and Parliament. I am concerned that that should be protected. I, for one, value it and that is why I am abstaining.",5,748,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00748
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Can the Member clarify or repeat the third clarification, please? I did not quite get that.",1,749,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00749
2022-11-29-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The third clarification is, I would like the Minister to confirm whether he accepts that the Courts have a constitutional role to ensure that Government actions, as well as Parliament's laws, do conform to the Constitution.",1,750,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00750
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, three questions. One, whether I agree that while there is a more immediate risk on section 377A, that those concerns do not quite apply to the current definition of marriage. No, I do not quite agree. I think what we can see and what we need to take reference from is what has happened elsewhere.",1,751,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00751
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We agree that there is a significant risk to section 377A. There, all of us are agreed.",2,752,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00752
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What is the Government's concern about the current definition of marriage? If you look at what has happened in India. The courts first said that their version, their section 377 was not unconstitutional. And then, within a few years, they said – well, it is unconstitutional. And now, earlier this year, they have said – the definition of marriage should be broader than a purely heterosexual marriage.",3,753,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00753
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is a similar system and similar broad common law principles. One can say and one can discern that there are different approaches that the Singapore Courts take vis-à-vis the Indian courts. But I think if you were to look at it as a lawyer, legal analysis and, particularly, if you are charged with a heavy responsibility to make sure that Singapore is looked after properly and that you care for Singapore and that your concern is for the well-being of Singaporeans, then you will not take these risks.",4,754,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00754
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"You will think them through, whether it is immediate or perhaps it is in the mid-term. If you think that there is a risk, then our duty is to go out there, explain the risks and then say how we would seek to put the laws in place to protect society, protect marriage, protect the institution of marriage and the structure of marriage, so that our society, successful as it has been, can continue to be successful, and so that the fundamental values of Singaporeans can be protected.",5,755,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00755
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is not a game. You do not take chances. You do not take fine legal analysis. Fine legal analysis is necessary to identify whether there is a risk. Once you identify there is a risk, you then do not go and take chances.",6,756,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00756
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, if one were to ask, ""Is the risk to the heterosexual definition of marriage less than the risk to section 377A?"", the answer is yes. But that does not lead to, ""Well, we do not have to do anything about it"". If there is a risk to something as fundamental as marriage, you act – or at least this Government acts.",7,757,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00757
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, do I not believe that the Government can convince the Court that providing for a heterosexual definition of marriage, we can tell the Court it is reasonable to say it should be between a man and a woman. Well, you have seen the arguments elsewhere. You have seen the social policy changes in the United Kingdom, from which many of our laws come. Of course, there, the laws have been changed through parliament, but there are many countries where the laws have been changed through the courts.",8,758,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00758
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I, for one, while I believe that our Courts have always taken the approach, the three great branches of the state, as I said yesterday – the Courts, the Judiciary, Parliament and the Executive – the system has worked well because each has respected the sphere of the other and our Judiciary is independent.",9,759,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00759
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If I were asked, I would say there is a reasonably good likelihood that we will be able to persuade the Court today that there is a basis for making a distinction between same-sex marriages and heterosexual marriages, and that the current definition of marriage in the Woman's Charter should be maintained. But if I were asked a different question, ""Is there a risk that it could be struck out?"", I think it would be either a stupid lawyer or a foolish lawyer who will say there is no risk. If you accept that there is a risk, then, what do you do? What do we do as Parliamentarians? I think the answer is clear.",10,760,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00760
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, do I accept that the Courts have a constitutional role? Of course, I accept that. But I think if the question goes towards why do we then say that the Courts should not look at the definition of marriage, I think I have given a very extensive answer. What should count as marriage should be decided here. The Courts can only make binary decisions. We should discuss it, we should decide it and we should take into account what society is ready for and what society needs and what strengthens society. Even if we take a view which is different from the majority view, then it is our duty to go and convince society as to why we are taking that view. We can do all of those things; the Courts cannot do those things.",11,761,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00761
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That is why we have decided there is this risk that the definition of marriage could be challenged and we have decided that is a matter for Parliament. We are not providing for a supermajority. So, any elected Government, by a simple majority, can decide on what a marriage ought to be like.",12,762,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00762
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,That is democracy. That is how democracy ought to work.,13,763,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00763
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"No Court can do what we did yesterday and today, which is to consider repealing section 377A, but at the same time, strengthening the institution of marriage and explaining the reasons, having it fully discussed, going out to the public and explaining – that is what is necessary. We believe that a future discussion would require these sorts of discussions and it may require changes to more than one piece of legislation.",14,764,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00764
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,How does the Court do that? They will decide on the question presented to them and strike out if they think it should be struck out. Where does that leave society?,15,765,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00765
2022-11-29-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, this is not a case of, ""Are we avoiding the supervisory jurisdiction of the Courts?"" It has been explained. I believe the overwhelming majority of Singaporeans support us on this constitutional amendment.",16,766,2022-11-29-T-019-S-00766

2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, the death penalty and the collateral criminal justice processes can be highly emotive matters, particularly after an appeal against the death penalty fails. But the varied considerations do not just include the rights of the condemned prisoner. There are other stakeholders in the criminal justice process. These include the rights of victims, the demand for fairness in the judicial system and the desire that Singapore remains safe for all.",1,912,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00912
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For a prisoner awaiting capital punishment, the arguments are not academic discussions of principle but, literally, a matter of life and death. Prior to the introduction of this Bill, and after the Government indicated that it was considering introducing post-appeal procedures for capital cases, I authored an op-ed in our local press on the mandatory death penalty. One point I made was to leave the matter of late applications to the Courts and allow cost orders to be the appropriate sanction. My concern was that the legislative changes proposed would either significantly curtail or prohibit post-appeal applications. If this Bill was meant to close off the possibility of new evidence being heard or new legal arguments being made in post-appeal applications in capital cases, or PACCs, the Workers' Party would vote against this Bill.",2,913,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00913
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Because of the irreversibility of the death penalty, lawyers should not be unduly fettered from advancing arguments to ensure that justice is done and their clients are saved from the noose. But I note that new material in the form of evidence and legal arguments are not prohibited by the proposals before the House today. The Court of Appeal is to be empowered under the Bill to take new evidence. While this Bill may appear to some as putting a spanner in the works for lawyers who wish to file PACCs, in my view, it serves to regulate the process better and does not close off defences not heard at trial. As a matter of principle, I do not see this Bill as hampering legal counsel who represent their clients dutifully.",3,914,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00914
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The regulation of the PACC process has come into focus arising from the reality of vexatious applications. When I say, ""come into focus"", I am not talking only about the sterile procedural aspects of PACCs. The point here is that PACCs cause profound human effects. One cannot discount the reality of these applications taking their toll on the prisoner, their spouses, their children, their parents, their extended families and their friends. If the hopes created by PACCs are reasonably achievable hopes, natural justice demands that we do not close any door to them.",4,915,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00915
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, in cases of vexatious applications, which have a zero chance of success, then the hopes are wickedly false, if the lawyers are aware of that fact.

If I can sum it up in one word, what most of us want in the system is fairness.",5,916,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00916
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Fairness must be a guiding principle in scrutinising all procedures relating to the death penalty. Of course, some may argue that it is not fair at all for the state to take the life of any person. But that is not the discussion for today. The mandatory death penalty is in our statutes for now. That may change as society or circumstances change. Our purpose today is to look at a sliver of the process and consider the just and fair handling of PACCs.",6,917,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00917
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the interest of achieving a fair process for PACCs, I have a few clarifications about the Bill. My first clarification relates to the statement made by the MinLaw spokesman and quoted The Straits Times of 7 November. The spokesman said, and I quote, ""The proposed amendments will clearly set out the process for such applications and the Court will have discretion to allow challenges, even if they do not comply with this process"".",7,918,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00918
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what is this discretion referred to here and what is its extent? Is the spokesman merely referring to the provisions in the proposed section 60J, under which the Court of Appeal may treat an application in another Court as a PACC application? If not, could the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify?",8,919,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00919
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My second clarification concerns the proposed section 60J(7) which provides the matters the Court of Appeal must consider in deciding whether to grant an application for PACC permission. In particular, the matter for consideration in section 60G(7)(d) is whether the PACC application has a reasonable prospect for success. I would like to confirm if the legislative intent is for para (7)(d) to set a threshold standard or is section 60G(7)(d) merely one of four factors which must be considered but which may be overriden by other considerations at the discretion of the Court of Appeal judge?",9,920,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00920
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, if it is meant to be a threshold standard, it could set a high bar that may prevent the applicant from even making a meritorious main application under section 60H. As such, I would like to clarify if the threshold standard required here is that of an arguable case and if this would represent the legislative intent insofar as section 60G(7)(d) is concerned?",10,921,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00921
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"If section 60G(7)(d) is not meant to be a threshold standard but merely a consideration which could possibly be disregarded if an arguable case comes before the Court, I would suggest that this be confirmed in the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's round-up speech.",11,922,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00922
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My third clarification concerns the phrase ""even with reasonable diligence"" used in the proposed section 60G(7)(a), section 60G(15)(c) and more than once in section 60M. May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what is the intention in using the word ""even"" in the phrase ""even with reasonable diligence""? My reading is that the use of the word ""even"" suggests that reasonable diligence is being compared with a higher standard, say due diligence. Is that the intention? If so, then to the extent that it endeavours to set a reachable standard, I do not object to it. If the Senior Parliamentary Secretary can clarify this, then, should the Bill be passed, it would make clear to the Court of Appeal the legislative intent is to set a lower standard than that of due diligence.",12,923,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00923
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The use of the term ""reasonable diligence"" brings me to my fourth clarification. The proposed section 60G(15) provides that where there has been abuse of process, the Court of Appeal, I quote, ""must not"" grant the application for PACC permission. This is unless evidence or legal arguments are presented that were not adduced before the finding of abuse of process and evidence or legal arguments could not even with reasonable diligence have been adduced in Court before the finding. The phrase used is ""must not"", which can only mean that the Court of Appeal judge has no discretion in the matter.",13,924,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00924
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Here, Madam, there is a need to distinguish between the prisoner and the lawyer representing that prisoner. It is possible to conceive of a situation where the lawyer who made the prior application, which was an abuse of process, was not thorough enough in raising evidence or legal arguments that were reasonably available. The prisoner then changes lawyers and the new, more diligent lawyer then raises the evidence and legal arguments which were available previously but not raised.",14,925,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00925
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In such a possible scenario, based on the Bill before us, due to section 60G(15)(d), the Court of Appeal must not grant the application for PACC permission. In such a scenario, it would appear that the Court of Appeal will have no discretion to take into consideration such a situation. May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether such a scenario was considered when the Bill was drafted and if it was, how does it relate to the proposed section 60G(15) (d)?",15,926,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00926
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The remedy against the lawyer who did not raise the arguments could be a personal cost order. But the prisoner should not be unfairly prejudiced. May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary why the words ""must not"" were used? Is it necessary to remove the Court of Appeal's discretion in this case?",16,927,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00927
2022-11-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, all my clarifications seek to promote fair outcomes for all parties, which I am sure is also the intention of the Government.

2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Given the serious nature of capital cases, it is critical that due process is in place to ensure that meritorious applications by prisoners awaiting capital punishment are heard. Such processes and the grounds for any decisions must be clear and transparent.",3,932,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00932
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three points of clarifications.,4,933,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00933
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is on the powers of the Court of Appeal to take additional evidence. A number of provisions in the Bill allow the Court of Appeal to take additional evidence. These situations include where the Court of Appeal is considering an application for permission to make a PACC application, is hearing a PACC application, is considering whether an application is a PACC application and is determining if there is an abuse of process.",5,934,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00934
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify whether the Court’s power to take additional evidence is exercisable only of the Court’s own motion or whether a party can apply for the Court to exercise its power to take additional evidence?,6,935,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00935
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary also share on what grounds or in what circumstances will the Court exercise its power to take additional evidence?,7,936,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00936
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If it is open to a party to apply to Court to take additional evidence, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify on what grounds can the application be made by a party?",8,937,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00937
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is what the standard of reasonable prospect of success entails. The Court is required to consider whether the PACC application has a reasonable prospect of success in deciding whether or not to grant an application for PACC permission.,9,938,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00938
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To provide more clarity on what constitutes a “reasonable prospect of success”, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share how this standard compares to the other standards articulated by the Court?",10,939,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00939
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is on the meaning of abuse of process. Under section 60G(15)(c), the Court of Appeal must not grant an application for PACC permission if the applicant is found to have abused the process of court.",11,940,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00940
2022-11-29-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Court of Appeal also has the power to make a finding of abuse of process. In the case of Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin vs Attorney-General, the Court found that while the defence counsel brought the review application to acquit Syed of the death penalty, this was by itself insufficient to find a collateral purpose amounting to an abuse of process. The Court observed that more would be needed to suggest that the intended outcome is in itself an abuse of process. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify what factors the Court should consider if determining an application is an abuse of process?",12,941,2022-11-29-T-021-S-00941

2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"As Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu had shared earlier, in Singapore, an accused person being charged with a capital offence will typically be offered free legal representation at trial and/or appeal through the Supreme Court's Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences, in short LASCO, regardless of his or her nationality and means.",2,948,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00948
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The accused persons would then be assigned by the LASCO case assignment panel with a lead counsel with at least seven years of legal practice, who have represented parties in several capital trials and appeals before the Court of Appeal against conviction and trial or acquittal.",3,949,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00949

2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"This team of assigned lawyers is expected to put forward the client's instructions to the best of their ability at the earliest opportunity through making representations to the prosecution, in the hope that the charge can be reduced to a non-capital one. If unsuccessful, they would proceed to put up a strongest possible defence at trial.",5,951,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00951
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In the event that the trial judge is not with the defence and finds the accused to be guilty, deliberations will be made whether an appeal ought to be made against the conviction on the basis that the trial judge might have either made an error of law or an error of fact in reaching his decision.",6,952,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00952
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"As the procedure develops to this stage and beyond, you will often find that the defence case is evidentially weak and chances of succeeding becomes even slimmer. While counsels might have advised the convicted person on this, the convicted persons may, at times, still insist and instruct his lawyers to explore further court proceeding options. Grasping at straws, while prolonging their time away from facing the gallows, such futile exercises would invariably cause much time and resources to be wasted. Ordering of personal costs, as one Member has suggested earlier, may be futile as PACPs more often than not, are of limited means.",7,953,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00953
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I therefore support this Bill, which seeks to deal with post-appeal applications in a capital case with a prisoner awaiting capital punishment, by introducing new procedures with enhanced safeguards for post-appeal applications. However, I wish to take this opportunity to seek the following clarifications.",8,954,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00954
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Firstly, in relation to legal representation. Typically, LASCO’s assignment will end in the event mitigation has been made by counsel and sentence has been given by the Court or when the case has been delisted from the Supreme Court – for example, when the prosecution eventually offers to reduce the charge to a non-capital one and be dealt with at the State Court’s jurisdiction instead – or when Presidential clemency has already been sought after the accused has been convicted of the capital offence.",9,955,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00955
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In this instance, would the LASCO scheme be extended to cover applications for PACC permission and PACC which may have occurred at a much later date after Presidential clemency has already been sought but rejected?",10,956,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00956
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The next question is in relation to whether one, three or five Court of Appeal judges to decide on PACC matters. Pursuant to the new section 60G(2) of the SCJA, the application for permission may be heard by a single judge exercising the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction. The SCJA also empowers for such application to be dealt with by three or any greater uneven number of judges sitting in the Court of Appeal. In this aspect, I wish to seek the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's clarification  under what circumstances would one, three or even five Court of Appeal judges be assigned to hear application for permission to make PACC application as well as PACC application?",11,957,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00957
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Whilst I understand the efficiency in getting just one Court of Appeal judge to hear and make a decision, we have witnessed on several occasions where landmark cases were made when Court of Appeal judges have dissenting views amongst themselves. The fact that such application for PACC may constitute a last-ditch attempt to prevent a possibility of miscarriage of justice means it might be prudent to have at least three Court of Appeal judges hear such applications.",12,958,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00958
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Finally, in relation to the right to seek clarifications. In the event a single judge has been tasked to decide on the application for permission and/or the PACC application, I understand from the new section 60G(8) and section 60H(6) of the SCJA that such applications may be summarily addressed without an oral hearing.",13,959,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00959
2022-11-29-T-023,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In such situations where the Court of Appeal judge has refused the application, I hope that a substantive written decision will be given to explain the basis of the decision. I would also suggest that there be liberty for PACP or his/her counsel to write in to seek clarifications and make further submissions to convince the judge otherwise. As per Lord Hewart, the then Lord Chief Justice of England, “Justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done”. Mdm Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my requests for clarifications and suggestions, I stand in support of this Bill.",14,960,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00960

2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, if I may quote from the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Datchinamurthy earlier this year  ""When a prisoner has been sentenced to the death penalty and is to be deprived of his life, he does not necessarily lose his other legal rights. Among other things, the exercise of discretion by the State in scheduling his execution is subject to legal limits, including the usual principles of judicial review and the fundamental liberties protected by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore"".",1,962,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00962
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Those where the words of Justice of Appeal Andrew Phang, a luminary legal giant who was honoured by members of the Judiciary, legal professionals and our greater community in his valedictory reference at the Supreme Court yesterday, which I attended.",2,963,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00963
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"When I was just a young law student, I observed a capital case hearing in the old Supreme Court Building – just next door. It was my first time attending any Court hearing. I was surprised when just before the sentencing, all of us in the courtroom was ordered to stand. I understood it as a mark of respect before the death penalty was handed down. The entire hearing also showed me how the system upholds the sanctity of life and the important role played by everyone – judges, prosecutors, and defence counsel – before anyone is deprived of his or her life. It was a moment that I remember till today.",3,964,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00964
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"It is thus not unsurprising that in capital offence cases, there is not only a thorough trial and appellate process where the Courts are careful and meticulous in sifting through the evidence and arguments, but there is also comprehensive support such as pro bono legal assistance through LASCO.",4,965,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00965
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, recently there have been many post-appeal applications in capital cases, also known as PACCs, which take up many years and judicial resources. Some of these PACCs were still being filed seven to 13 years after the first conviction. These PACCs take up not only judicial time and resources but in actual fact they have robbed the convicted inmates, and most importantly, their families, of what is left in their lifetime, and victims' families of a time for closure and peace.",5,966,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00966
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"This Bill ensures that in respect of PACC applications, there is a balance between due process and rights of PACP and also preventing the resources of the state from being unduly wasted by frivolous PACC applications. It is against this backdrop that I stand to speak today.",6,967,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00967
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I will touch on three points in my speech. First, on due process – how the Bill can ensure that the accused or PACP can be assured of due process in PACCs. Second, on liability of solicitors who are representing PACPs. Third, on what we can do together beyond this Bill to ensure that more awareness can be raised in relation to our criminal justice system.",7,968,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00968
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"First, on due process. The new process for a single judge hearing a PACC will save a significant amount of judicial time. This also means that it will be easier for the scheduling of court hearing on an urgent basis. However, a single judge hearing may give the impression that these PACCs are of lesser importance.",8,969,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00969
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Since these PACCs are the PACP's last resort, perhaps we should require more safeguards than just one judge presiding over the PACC hearing. This is a point made by hon Member Ms Hany Soh too.",9,970,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00970
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"With the use of virtual hearing and technology, it is not difficult to convene a hearing with coram of two or three judges online. Perhaps it can also be clarified that for PACC of a certain degree of complexity, there can be more than one judge. To ensure efficiency, guillotine time or specific time limits for oral submissions and page limits for written submissions can be set prior to PACCs.",10,971,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00971
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"To borrow from the practice of international arbitration, the Courts can also set a memorandum of important issues to be address at the hearing so as to focus the judicial time on pertinent issues of relevance and materiality to the outcome of the PACC.",11,972,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00972
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Separately, given the time-sensitive nature of the PACC, I hope that there will be assurance that such applications shall be heard urgently and that the AGC and its prosecutors will do their utmost best to achieve this as well.",12,973,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00973
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, on the liability of solicitors representing the PACPs. Many defence counsel in these cases are doing it pro bono or on LASCO scheme. They are playing an important part in our criminal justice system. We owe a debt of gratitude to them appreciate their key role and contributions. Inevitably, the role of counsel comes under the spotlight in PACC applications where there tend be an abuse of process of delay in making such applications.",13,974,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00974
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, not all blame lies on the solicitor. Take for example, in cases where counsel has already advised the PACP that the chance of success is low, but the PACP insists on making such an application. In such a case, I hope that it will be made clear that any costs liability will be borne by the PACP and not counsel, except in egregious abuse of process cases caused by the solicitors.",14,975,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00975
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The imposition of personal cost orders against counsel comes under the Criminal Procedure Code whereby lawyers who file applications that are frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court may have cost sanctions imposed on them. However, the Court of Appeal in the recent case of Iskandar bin Rahmat has recently held that a high threshold must be met before adverse cost orders may be imposed.",15,976,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00976
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),In the future perhaps the Ministry can consider codifying the narrow situations in which costs penalty may be considered against any counsel for clarity.,16,977,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00977
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Another scenario is where new solicitors have just taken over conduct of the matter. Some PACPs are known to discharge solicitors and engage new ones at the last moment. In such cases, costs liability should be on the PACP. This is because counsel would be place in the most difficult position at the cost submissions or hearing because he or she cannot divulge or breach solicitor-client privilege. Where the PACCs are not conducted on a pro bono basis or on LASCO, a suggestion perhaps is to require the PACP to furnish security or undertaking for costs if certain requirements are met. This is nothing new in the civil appellate practice.",17,978,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00978
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),I hope these suggestions will encourage more defence counsel and pro bono LASCO lawyers who will step forward to contribute.,18,979,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00979
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I now turn to raising awareness internationally. Under International law, the death penalty is not prohibited, whether by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) or any other international treaty. In Singapore, capital punishment is only applied to the most serious crimes that cause grave harm to others and to society.",19,980,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00980
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In this regard, I also note the United Nations Human Rights Office of the Commissioner issued a statement in 1984 on the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. In particular, paragraph 6 of the safeguards stated that steps should be taken to ensure that appeals from a death sentence shall become mandatory. Paragraph 8 states  ""Capital punishment shall not be carried out pending any appeal or other recourse procedure or other proceeding relating to pardon or commutation of the sentence"".",20,981,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00981
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In my view, this PACC Bill which further clarifies the due process beyond the appellate process is consistent with not only international law standards but also the safeguards aforesaid.",21,982,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00982
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, we can do more to raise awareness of the approach towards capital offences in our jurisdiction. For foreign PACPs, what are the measures that can be done to engage foreign embassies and governments on our approach towards PACPs who are foreign citizens? On a people-to-people level, what more can be done to raise such awareness?",22,983,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00983
2022-11-29-T-023,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"One suggestion, perhaps, would be for our law schools or even the Judiciary to host foreign law students on exchange and expose them to the inner workings of criminal justice system. I hope that the foreign students or delegation will, having seen us up close, can better understand Singapore's context and criminal justice system on such capital offences.",23,984,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00984

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Firstly, on Mr Pritam Singh's questions on the threshold. With regards to the first clarification that he raised, what was meant is that the Bill merely provides that the Court must consider the matters in section, 60G(7). The Court retains discretion to grant permission even if any or all the matters are not met. The Bill sets out the conditions to be satisfied and the procedures to be followed and is enabling in nature. This is to advance the interests of justice.",2,988,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00988
2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The statement by the spokesman referred to by Mr Singh, made the point that ultimately the Court will retain some discretion because the Bill does not absolutely rule out the exercise of such discretion.",3,989,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00989
2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Parliament's intention is that such applications where the conditions in this Bill have not been satisfied should generally not succeed given the legislative intent expressed through the Bill to set up a process to be followed. The Court will exercise considerable care because there is finality, because we do not want to rule out the possibility.",4,990,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00990
2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The framework sets out what the Court will consider and it is likely to be extremely rare for the Court to go beyond this. So, the intention is for the framework to be followed.",5,991,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00991

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The provision on abuse is about abuse by the applicant, not by the lawyer. When they have previously abused the process, we think that section 60G(15) is a fair requirement because the Court can still grant permission if the requirements in section 60G(15)(c) and (d) are met, which are reasonable requirements.",7,993,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00993
2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"On the third point about reasonable diligence, this is a factor for the Courts to consider when deciding whether the evidence and arguments in the application could have been brought earlier.

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,Mr Louis Ng had asked whether the Court's power to take additional evidence can only be exercised on its own motion and about the grounds on which the Court would exercise this power.,9,995,2022-11-29-T-023-S-00995
2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The Court's power to take additional evidence is exercisable on the Court's own motion, or upon a party's application.

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The phrase ""reasonable prospect of success"" is meant to clarify that in deciding whether to grant permission to make a PACC application, the CA is to consider the merits of the intended PACC application.

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Ultimately, the CA will be guided by the language of the provision, which is whether the intended PACC application has a reasonable prospect of success. To this end, it may not be helpful to focus on the standards mentioned by Mr Ng because these have been developed in different contexts and it may not be applicable to the PACC application. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, the CA has the discretion to grant permission to make a PACC application even if the CA is not satisfied that the intended PACC application has a reasonable prospect of success.",14,1000,2022-11-29-T-023-S-01000

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Under the new sections 60G(15)(c) and (d) of the SCJA, even when there was a prior abuse of process finding, as I mentioned earlier, the CA may grant an application for PACC permission if  one, the PACP adduces material that was not adduced in court before the date of the most recent finding of abuse of process; and two, the material could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been adduced in court before that date.",16,1002,2022-11-29-T-023-S-01002

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"A PACC application cannot be heard and determined by a single Judge. Only an application for permission to make a PACC application can be heard and determined by a single Judge. Having a single Judge hear the application for permission to make a PACC application reflects the fact that, at this stage, the Court is only deciding whether permission to make the PACC application should be granted, and the Court is not required to conduct a full determination of the merits of the PACC application.",19,1005,2022-11-29-T-023-S-01005

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"And as to Mr Zhulkarnain's point about the time-sensitive nature of such applications, the cases have shown that the Courts hear them urgently.

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Zhulkarnain asked about costs orders against lawyers. All lawyers have a duty to conscientiously assess the merits of a case before engaging in court proceedings. If the lawyer thinks there is no merit but the PACP insists on making the application, the lawyer should decline to act. The Courts have observed that the filing of ill-considered and baseless applications by lawyers cannot be justified on the basis that the PACP faces a capital sentence.",26,1012,2022-11-29-T-023-S-01012

2022-11-29-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Zhulkarnain has highlighted the importance of raising international awareness and understanding of Singapore's approach to capital offences. We agree that this is important. Criticisms of Singapore's approach are often based on misconceptions and inaccurate facts. Singapore actively engages in international fora such as the UN, as well as bilaterally to address misconceptions and explain our approach.

Today, about 8,500 of the nearly 15,200 HDB shops are sold.",1,1025,2022-11-29-T-024-S-01025
2022-11-29-T-024,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As HDB shops were sold purely on commercial terms with no government subsidies, the shops are treated in a similar manner to private commercial properties and shop owners need not inform HDB when they rent out their shops.

We encourage flat applicants to refer to the information and apply for a project with a lower application rate to improve their chances of securing a flat. Based on past launches, about 40% of invited flat applicants do not proceed to book a flat. Therefore, an application rate of not more than 1.7 times would give flat applicants a good chance of securing a flat.",4,1037,2022-11-29-T-026-S-01037
2022-11-29-T-026,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We wish to assure the Member that HDB regularly reviews and improves its systems, to enhance user experience. For instance, for the November 2022 sales launch, HDB rolled out a virtual waiting room feature on the flat application webpage. Should there be many applicants accessing the system at once, applicants will be directed to the virtual waiting room and given a real-time indication of how long they would need to wait before proceeding to the next step of their application.

2022-11-29-T-040,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) are allocated via a market-based bidding system and COE prices reflect the demand and supply for vehicles. The overall demand for cars has remained resilient while the COE supply has decreased due to a lower number of car deregistrations. COE prices have thus been increasing.,1,1089,2022-11-29-T-040-S-01089
2022-11-29-T-040,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Cars can be converted in and out of the private hire car (PHC) scheme, which includes rental cars.

For example, we have constructed rock revetments along the coasts of Pulau Tekong and Kranji Coastal Nature Park. These structures protect our coastlines against erosion and facilitate the accumulation of sediments, which in turn promotes the natural growth of mangroves. In addition, through the use of the science-based Ecological Mangrove Restoration method, around 8,000 mangrove plants are expected to naturally take root at Sungei Durian on Pulau Ubin by end-2026. Such efforts to promote the natural propagation of mangrove plants further support our mangrove ecosystems, beyond the planting of saplings under the OneMillionTrees movement.",3,1096,2022-11-29-T-041-S-01096

Since February 2022, the Municipal Services Office (MSO) has worked with NEA, LTA, PUB, HDB and NParks to integrate a number of related municipal services, namely, cleaning, infrastructure maintenance, greenery maintenance and other municipal service operations, under one integrated operator, in Tampines town. The intent is to enhance responsiveness of service delivery. With clear accountability and a system of outcome-based contracting, the single operator is incentivized to find solutions to pre-empt or resolve recurring problems, even if the issues cut across agency boundaries. The ground crew of the operator is also crossed-trained to respond to different issues, in order to achieve greater productivity.",1,1099,2022-11-29-T-042-S-01099

The wellness ambassadors provide basic emotional support to fellow colleagues and act as ambassadors for mental well-being. There are currently about 2,000 WAs across job levels and agencies.",5,1129,2022-11-29-T-049-S-01129
2022-11-29-T-049,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"Beyond the provision of mental well-being resources, support from leaders and managers was key to caring for public officers' mental health. To encourage a culture of openness and emphasise the role that leaders and supervisors play, PSD actively enlists our leaders to de-stigmatise mental health issues and support the well-being of their teams. For instance, PSD launched a week-long campaign in 2021, called ""Care4U"" Week, which encouraged leaders and supervisors to adopt WOG well-being initiatives and policies in their workplaces, and equipped leaders with skills to identify signs of mental stress so that they can support officers and their peers. As we transit to the new normal, we will continue to adapt this suite of initiatives to meet the needs of public officers.",6,1130,2022-11-29-T-049-S-01130

2022-11-29-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Most recently, the Rules of Court 2021, which came into operation on 1 April 2022, simplified the process which applies to the enforcement of civil judgments and orders. For example, where the judgment debt is not satisfied, the party seeking to enforce the order or judgment may now make a single application requesting one or more methods of enforcement. Previously, separate applications were required for different methods of enforcement.",2,1133,2022-11-29-T-050-S-01133
2022-11-29-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We are currently working with MSF on a joint Bill to introduce enhancements to the maintenance enforcement regime.

2022-11-29-T-051,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Law whether the Supreme Court (Protection from Harassment) Rules 2021 may be amended to provide for summary determination and disposal of frivolous and vexatious claims by claimants without the need to notify the respondents to reduce the risk of the Protection from Harassment Court being used by claimants against respondents for collateral purposes.,1,1137,2022-11-29-T-051-S-01137

2022-11-29-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For claims filed through simplified proceedings, which form a significant majority of cases filed in the Protection from Harassment Court (PHC), the PHC has, at any time after a claim is filed, powers to make such orders and directions as it thinks fit for the just, expeditious and economic disposal of a case. The PHC therefore may, notwithstanding that the proceedings are already simplified, deal with a case which is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process in an appropriate way.",2,1139,2022-11-29-T-051-S-01139

2022-11-29-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Further, in making a decision to award costs and disbursements, the PHC may take into account whether the claim was dismissed for being frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process.",4,1141,2022-11-29-T-051-S-01141
2022-11-29-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As with civil disputes in general, the PHC will usually require the Respondent's side of the story to determine whether the claim is indeed frivolous or vexatious.",5,1142,2022-11-29-T-051-S-01142
2022-11-29-T-051,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The General Division of the High Court (GDHC) is also empowered to, on application by the Attorney-General or any party to a claim, make restraint orders against a claimant who has repeatedly commenced actions that are totally without merit, to restrain such a claimant from commencing actions or applications.

2022-11-29-T-052,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"LTA has recently completed trials on the effectiveness of noise barriers and low-noise pavement mix. The trials showed that low-noise pavement mix for at-grade sections of expressways are more effective at reducing noise for residents than vertical noise barriers, as the former reduces the noise generated at source while the latter shields noise away from residents staying at lower floors and would not be effective for residents staying at higher floors.",1,1145,2022-11-29-T-052-S-01145
2022-11-29-T-052,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"LTA has been and will continue to implement measures to reduce noise along stretches of expressways near residential areas. For at-grade sections of expressways, LTA will use the low-noise pavement mix when conducting resurfacing works. For elevated sections of expressways, LTA will consider installing noise barriers where needed. In doing so, LTA considers multiple factors such as the distance between the expressways and surrounding buildings.",2,1146,2022-11-29-T-052-S-01146

2022-11-29-T-053,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"According to the General Insurance Association of Singapore, Singaporean motorists should claim against their Singapore policies in instances of accidents with foreign motorists, if they have a comprehensive motor insurance policy. This will save them the inconvenience and longer process of making a claim against motorists from other countries. If the motorist is found not at fault in the accident, his or her No-Claim Discount may not be affected. If a Singaporean motorist wishes to make a third-party motor claim against an insurer in Malaysia instead, they are advised to approach the insurer in Malaysia with the relevant documents. Under a Special Agreement with the Motor Insurance Bureau of Singapore, Malaysian insurers are required to settle claims for their insured who get into accidents in Singapore, in accordance with Singapore legislation. As these are commercial claims, the Government does not track such claims.",2,1149,2022-11-29-T-053-S-01149

2022-11-29-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Today, most of our streetlights are LED lights, comprising a mix of warmer white light of 3,000 Kelvin (K) colour temperature, and brighter white light of 4,000 K colour temperature. LTA's research and studies of international safety standards has shown that both these lights have no adverse impact on human health as the blue light emitted is of very low intensity.",1,1152,2022-11-29-T-054-S-01152
2022-11-29-T-054,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The specific type of lighting deployed will depend on the distance of the streetlight from residential areas.

2022-11-29-T-057,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"LTA does not set guidelines on conditions for early contract termination for taxi and private hire car (PHC) rentals, which are commercially determined as part of agreements between rental companies and drivers. Taxi/PHC rental companies may offer different packages and contracts to cater to the different needs and preferences of drivers. We understand that rental companies do review early terminations on a case-by-case basis, and we encourage them to continue doing so in a compassionate manner. Drivers who need to terminate their contracts early due to unforeseen circumstances are encouraged to discuss possible options with their respective rental companies.

2022-11-29-T-064,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The amount of CPF monies that flat buyers can use for their flat purchase, the HDB housing loan quantum and the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) quantum, are dependent on the remaining lease of the flat and the age of the youngest flat buyer. If the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer until at least the age of 95, the flat buyers can obtain the maximum CPF usage, HDB housing loan quantum and EHG quantum that they are eligible for. Flat buyers who do not meet this criterion will still be able to use their CPF monies, take an HDB housing loan and receive the EHG, but the amounts would be pro-rated.",1,1185,2022-11-29-T-064-S-01185

2022-11-29-T-065,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for National Development in each year over the last five years, what is the average discount applied to the market value of comparable resale HDB flats in pricing new HDB BTO flats in (i) mature estates and (ii) non-mature estates, with the respective breakdown in flat types.",1,1188,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01188
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In pricing new Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, HDB's overriding aim is to ensure public housing is affordable to help a broad segment of Singaporeans own their own homes. This is different from private residential development where new flats are priced above development cost to achieve a certain profit margin. This flat pricing process is separate and independent from the determination of the development cost of HDB projects. Overall, the money that HDB collects from selling new flats cannot cover the total development cost incurred for these flats and HDB has been running a deficit every year for its homeownership programme since its formation.",1,1189,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01189
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Affordability is a function of household income and flat selling price. At the current income ceiling of $14,000, about eight in 10 Singaporeans may buy a BTO flat and HDB aims to provide affordable flats for a range of household incomes, as measured by the Mortgage Servicing ratio (MSR). BTO flats have been priced at a level where on average, first-time homebuyers generally require little or no cash outlay when servicing their mortgage payments, as it can be fully covered using their CPF contributions.",2,1190,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01190
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB first establishes the market value of the new flats by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby, as well as the individual attributes of the flats and prevailing market conditions. A significant subsidy is then applied to the assessed market values of the new flats to ensure affordability for flat buyers. A wide range of flat sizes and locations of new BTO flats are offered at every BTO sales launch. The market values of these flats are not the same and the flats should not be uniformly-priced. As the locations and attributes of BTO projects and the resale market conditions at each BTO launch, are different, the extent of the discounts will thus vary across different BTO projects, launches and years. This is the case because HDB's overriding objective is to ensure that BTO flats remain affordable and help protect homebuyers from price fluctuations under different market conditions.",3,1191,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01191
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In addition, eligible first-timer flat buyers can enjoy the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) of up to $80,000.

It is not tied to flat type or BTO project and it is given on top of the generous market discount applied to the flat.",4,1192,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01192
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In sum, market subsidies vary across projects and launches because of the wide range of HDB flats on offer at every BTO sales exercise. They also vary with the prevailing resale market conditions and depend on the homebuyers' household incomes after factoring in the EHG.",5,1193,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01193
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For each BTO project launched, HDB provides recent transacted prices of comparable resale flats alongside the BTO flat prices. It is clear to every BTO flat applicant that there is a significant difference between HDB BTO flat prices and comparable resale flat prices. The difference in these price ranges also explains why BTO flats are highly popular and usually over-subscribed.",6,1194,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01194
2022-11-29-T-065,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB also provides relevant price-related information for different family archetypes as well as worked illustrations of how homebuyers with different household incomes can afford the different flat types in the BTO launch materials. We also compute their corresponding MSRs to show the affordability of these new BTO flats. In fact, HDB has been providing these comparative information and affordability illustrations since December 2008. The information is made available is to guide homebuyers in their flat purchase decisions and help them choose an HDB flat that best meets their budgets and needs.",7,1195,2022-11-29-T-065-S-01195
