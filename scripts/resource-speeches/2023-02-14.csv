2023-02-14-T-001,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I thank Senior Minister of State Janil for his response. Apart from enhancing the monitoring procedures, I hope that the Ministry of Health can also consider having a standard operating procedure in place whereby the hospitals are providing neonatal parental support where it is automatically activated to ensure that the helpless parents are assured of the procedures that will be in place and the essential resources available to assist them.",1,5,2023-02-14-T-001-S-00005

E-commerce benefits consumers by offering them a wider choice of goods and services, at a wider range of prices. It also reduces the costs of sale such as those incurred by physical retail outlets.",1,8,2023-02-14-T-002-S-00008

2023-02-14-T-003,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","Mr Speaker, the purpose of our tax incentives for single family offices (SFOs) is to provide them certainty that the funds they set up will not be taxed on income derived from investments managed in Singapore. Without such certainty, funds of a single family office may be taxed in Singapore in addition to the tax that the family, as an investor, may be subject to. This would make it unattractive for SFOs to set up and invest in funds in Singapore.",1,10,2023-02-14-T-003-S-00010

2023-02-14-T-003,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","SFOs often start with small teams of investment professionals. Hence, the more meaningful way to create local jobs is through their positive spillover effects in creating demand for ancillary services like legal, custody and tax services and fund administration. As elaborated in this House previously, Government agencies are developing initiatives to tap the growing interest from family offices to provide capital to support enterprise financing, environmental, social and governance investments and philanthropic activities.",4,13,2023-02-14-T-003-S-00013

2023-02-14-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, does MAS have the regulatory powers to oversee family offices to prevent tax evasion and fraud? Second, will the Government consider having the employment of Singaporeans as a hiring requirement for family offices for local job creation?",1,16,2023-02-14-T-003-S-00016
2023-02-14-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. Family offices do open accounts with banks in Singapore, and MAS requires all banks operating in Singapore to put in place robust controls to detect and defer the flow of illicit funds. These controls include rigorous processes to identify customers, understand the intended purpose of account opening, evaluate the risks posed and monitor the accounts on an ongoing basis for suspicious activity. Since 2018, Singapore has activated over 70 relationships with countries to share tax-related information. Though these relationships, tax authorities will be able to get information through financial institutions of account holders who are their tax residents. These reaffirm Singapore's commitment to international standards on transparency and cross-border tax cooperation to deter tax evasion.",1,17,2023-02-14-T-003-S-00017
2023-02-14-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the Member's other question, I would like to respond that SFOs are set up to manage the family's own monies. And thus, it is reasonable for the families to have the discretion to make their own decisions on who to hire to manage their families' investments. Further, family offices often invest in globally diversified assets which may require knowledge of overseas markets; and fundamentally, not imposing a requirement to hire locals is to allow family offices the same ability to make hiring decisions that are based on merit, similar to other employers.",2,18,2023-02-14-T-003-S-00018
2023-02-14-T-003,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Nonetheless, it is our objective to create good jobs here and to give our locals the best chance to take up those jobs by investing heavily in their capabilities and skills. To equip locals with skills relevant to family offices, MAS has partnered with industry experts and the Institute of Banking and Finance to launch three skills maps for the family office sector in 2020 and 2021.",3,19,2023-02-14-T-003-S-00019

2023-02-14-T-004,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, to reduce electronic waste or e-waste, the European Union (EU) requires all mobile phones and other portable electronic devices sold in the EU to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port by the end of 2024. The Indian government intends to implement a similar requirement. But most countries have not announced similar measures. We are monitoring developments in this space, including manufacturers' response to the EU requirements. In the meantime, we have implemented other ways to manage e-waste, such as the Extended Producer Responsibility framework.",1,22,2023-02-14-T-004-S-00022

What would be the triggers or key factors in determining a change in policy on this, given the developments in the EU and India that the Minister of State referred to? Reports state that the measure, when it comes into effect in the EU, will cut down e-waste by 11,000 tonnes a year and save consumers 250 million euros a year. So, in light of that, what would be the factors that would be the triggers that will bring about a change in policy on this point?",1,24,2023-02-14-T-004-S-00024

2023-02-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, the Progressive Wage Model, or PWM, provides career and training progression pathways for our lower-wage workers, which allows them to see meaningful and sustainable wage increases as they improve their skills and productivity. Each PWM ladder differentiates job rungs based on the job scope and skills required. Higher wages on upper job rungs reflect the increased responsibilities and skills expected of employees. PWM training requirements specified for each job rung support employees in acquiring the skills needed to do that job.",1,28,2023-02-14-T-005-S-00028

2023-02-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"While there are training requirements for each job rung, PWM wages are based on the job that the employee is performing and not the completion of training requirements.

2023-02-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Generally, the employer would have placed the employee on a job that the employee is able to perform.

2023-02-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"PWM training requirements are determined through tripartite consultation and agreement. Tripartite Partners are mindful that training requirements which are meant to uplift lower-wage workers should not end up disadvantaging them. To support the training of workers who may have lower literacy skills or face language barriers, training providers can supplement the delivery of PWM training courses with vernacular and/or visual aids. Where feasible, some PWM training requirements can also be met through assessment-only pathways. These pathways allow experienced employees to meet the PWM training requirements by completing assessments – and typically, these are done in person – to show that they have the requisite skills, without having to attend the course.",5,32,2023-02-14-T-005-S-00032

We recognise positive traits, such as resilience and sense of duty, among this group of caregivers. However, we are mindful not to overgeneralise caregivers as they are unique individuals after all, and employers ought to assess each of them fairly based on their qualities and ability to fulfil the job requirements without bias.",1,35,2023-02-14-T-006-S-00035

Having access to FWAs will enable caregivers to work sustainably around their caregiving needs. We have developed resources, such as implementation guides and FWA policy templates, and conducted workshops to guide employers in adopting FWAs. We will also be introducing a set of Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024, and this will set norms for FWA requests to be requested and evaluated fairly.",2,36,2023-02-14-T-006-S-00036

However, we have several units and these are residents with very exceptional cases where the water seepage disamenity has been unsolved for many years.

Firstly, I must assure the Member that we empathise with the situation of those flat unit owners.

I wonder if the Senior Minister of State would be willing to elaborate on the tolerable timeline with which these kind of disputes are accepted before they are ultimately resolved. The reason why I ask is because it is often the case that, especially, when the leak emanates from the upper floor, it does not really affect one neighbour but it affects the downstairs neighbour, and this often leads to a lot of foot-dragging, in terms of their willingness to proceed with their cost-sharing.",1,147,2023-02-14-T-017-S-00147

We want to resolve those issues as quickly as possible, understanding that it causes disamenities and inconveniences to residents, especially in the lower floor. But many of these cases requires both parties to come together.

This additional revenue will also help to cover higher spending in other areas. In particular, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) has ramped up its Build-To-Order (BTO) supply to catch up with the backlog that had arisen from the COVID-19 delays.

The European Union (EU) is amongst the hardest hit, due to the economic consequences of its exposure to the war in Ukraine. The US is seeing slower growth and may enter a recession, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to combat elevated inflation.

Our handling of the pandemic over the past three years has enhanced our reputation as a reliable and trusted node in global supply chains. Our deep relationships with both the US and China, as well as our partners in ASEAN and the wider region, make us a neutral and increasingly important place for global and regional businesses.

In fact, many seniors themselves prefer to be cared for in the community and to grow old in an environment that is familiar to them, surrounded by their loved ones. We will, therefore, need to review and update our approaches to aged care – to ensure seniors live as much of their lives in good health as possible and have ample options to age in the community.",193,379,2023-02-14-T-022-S-00379

2023-02-14-T-026,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mobile Speed Cameras (MSCs) are portable speed detection devices which can be easily deployed at different locations. Should speeding prove rampant at a particular stretch of road, the Traffic Police (TP) may consider deploying a fixed speed camera instead, if the terrain permits.",1,506,2023-02-14-T-026-S-00506
2023-02-14-T-026,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member referenced the Police's Mid-Year Traffic Situation Report for 2022. The report found that the number of speeding-related violations and accidents increased in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was partly due to the increase in traffic volume in 2022, with the easing of COVID-19 measures. The number of speeding-related violations, however, was lower than pre-pandemic.",2,507,2023-02-14-T-026-S-00507

The focus of the trial is to adjust traffic lights dynamically to optimise travel time for vehicles and other road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists who use pedestrian crossings. For CRUISE to be used to detect cyclists on roads, the Land Transport Authority would have to enhance the algorithms and conduct more trials, which would in turn make the system more complex and costly.",1,514,2023-02-14-T-028-S-00514
