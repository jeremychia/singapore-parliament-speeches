2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, between August 2020 and December 2022, the Singapore Global Network Funding Programme (SGNFP) disbursed around $570,000 and supported close to 300 ground-up efforts around the world. About two-thirds of SGNFP applications were successful. These included funding for events such as networking sessions, forums, webinars, festive celebrations and partnerships on digital content creation.",1,2,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00002
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"These efforts support the SGN in broadening and deepening our overseas ties and network with family, friends and fans of Singapore. The programme has reached out to around 25,000 participants in more than 20 countries like Australia, China, the United Kingdom and the United States, where many overseas Singaporeans are based.",2,3,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00003

2023-02-27-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Is the main objective of SGN Funding Programme to encourage Singaporean talent abroad to return to Singapore and contribute to our economy and our society. And if not, what is the SGN programme's main objective? Secondly, what kind of events and activities were funded by SGN? The Minister of State mentioned that there was $570,000 that was spent.",1,5,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00005
2023-02-27-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And how effective were they in achieving these objectives? I am not sure if I heard correctly that two-thirds were successful. What happens to the other one-third, then?",2,6,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00006
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. I think he will agree with me that overseas Singaporeans are an integral part of the Singapore family. If you remember, SGN was launched in August 2020 and that replaced the Overseas Singaporeans Unit (OSU). [",1,7,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00007
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The SGN has various programmes and one of the programme is the one that the Parliamentary Question (PQ) is about, the SGN Funding Programme which supports the SGN to broaden and deepen our overseas network of family and friends. Especially at the height of COVID-19, it was so important to make sure that they remained connected to Singapore, even as they were overseas expanding their network.",2,8,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00008
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Allow me to also share that today, within a short span of two-and-a-half years, and despite COVID-19 and the difficulty of organising events, the SGN now has more than 100,000 members around the world, including 15,000 C-suite executives. And there are close to 300 partners that collaborate with the SGN on various partnership initiatives, to do a few things and the aim of SGN is to do a few things  one, to promote networking and collaboration amongst Singaporeans and friends of Singapore; two, connect the community of family and friends of Singapore; and three, at the same time, also to provide platforms to share about opportunities and development in Singapore and Southeast Asia.",3,9,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00009
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,The SGN team is also open to working with overseas Singaporeans who are exploring to come back to Singapore to work or to have them to come back because of the kids' education.,4,10,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00010
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In terms of the numbers, I mentioned that, even though, due to COVID-19, we could not have events, it is quite heartening to see that we have received 448 applications for the SGN and the SGN Funding Programme. Out of that, two-thirds – 70% of the applicants are Singaporeans. Two-thirds of the applications were approved and out of those approved, 70% are Singaporeans, of which more than 60% are students.",5,11,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00011
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"So, it is an important platform to allow our students, our working professionals, business owners overseas, to stay connected to Singapore through these various activities – whether it is webinar or over Zoom or physical sessions. I can tell you, National Day and Lunar New Year celebrations in the various cities are very well-received, especially when we bring Singaporean food.",6,12,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00012

2023-02-27-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,I thank the Minister of State for her answer. Does SGN work closely with our Missions abroad to engage Singaporeans on domestic and foreign policy issues that matter to them overseas as well as their families back home? This is related to also my cut on Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) later no engaging Singaporeans on foreign policy.,1,15,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00015
2023-02-27-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank the Member for his supplementary question. Since the launch in August 2020, the SGN has replaced the Overseas Singaporeans Unit and is now sitting with the Economic Development Board. As part of that, the SGN team will work closely with not just the economic agencies but also with MFA and our Missions as well, to allows Singaporeans, even though they cannot come back – for example, in the last three years, whether they are in Beijing or in other cities in Australia and the US – that they have a way to stay connected to Singapore and at the same time, to also understand the various refinements to the policies, and the current affairs as well.",1,16,2023-02-27-T-001-S-00016
2023-02-27-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government will consider introducing plain language legislation to ensure clarity and accessibility of Government communications, as has been passed in the United States and New Zealand.",1,17,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00017
2023-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"Mr Speaker, Sir, we do want to achieve better Government communications through plain and clear language. However, there are no plans to pursue this aim through legislation. Our public communications policy calls for plain language so that messages are clear and accessible for members of the public. The Government Instruction Manual requires all public servants to write well and speak clearly. Communication is an essential function of public service and we need to do so in all four of our official languages.",1,18,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00018
2023-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"Mr Speaker, the Government acknowledges that not all of its communications are written in a simple, concise and clear manner. However, introducing legislation is not the answer. Instead we will pursue this aim through education, training, role-modelling and holding ourselves to high standards. The experience in other countries where legislation has been introduced suggests that our approach has merit.",2,19,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00019

2023-02-27-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I appreciate the Senior Minister of State's reply. I just have one supplementary question, which is that, would the Government consider launching a whole-of-Government movement to simplify language in Government communications in a very concerted manner that is regularly reviewed.",1,22,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00022
2023-02-27-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, could I just read out one sentence from a letter I received from a Government agency?",2,23,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00023
2023-02-27-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,If you keep it concise.,1,24,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00024
2023-02-27-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Yes. I received this letter from a particular agency and I am just going to read out this one sentence  ""We have reviewed your case and we regret to inform you that we are unable to accede to your request as the evidence supports the offence disclosed.""",1,25,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00025
2023-02-27-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I do not mean to be too prescriptive but, for example, you could reword this and say, ""We have reviewed the facts and we are sorry that we cannot agree to your request because there is not enough proof."" This is an example. For many Singaporeans who receive Government communications, English may not always be their first language. So, I think my clarification is, would the Government consider implementing much more simplified communications in its letters and so on to Singaporeans, as a whole-of-Government effort.",2,26,2023-02-27-T-002-S-00026
2023-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I agree with Mr Leon Perera that we do need to simplify our communications and aim for clarity, wherever possible. We also do have to make sure that there is precision and accuracy in the statements.

2023-02-27-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the distinctions between social carpooling and illegal carpooling as defined by the Ministry; and (b) what action will the Ministry take to stop the use of chat groups that facilitate illegal carpooling.,1,29,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00029
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"A shared journey involving friends or colleagues, where typically no payment is required, is considered a social carpooling trip.",1,30,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00030
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"However, if the carpooling is among strangers, that is, the passenger does not know the driver, then, in the interest of both drivers and passengers, this must be done via licensed carpooling operators, for example by booking GrabHitch or RydePool services; or through other smaller operators. In such cases, operators are required to verify drivers’ licences and enforce a maximum of two carpool journeys a day at cost recovery. Details of booked trips are also recorded by operators, which can be used to aid investigations in the event of an incident or a dispute. Illegal carpooling trips matched through other platforms such as Telegram chat groups do not have such safeguards. We would urge members of the public to book their journeys only with carpooling operators.",2,31,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00031
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been taking enforcement action against drivers providing illegal carpooling services under section 101(1) of the Road Traffic Act and will continue to monitor and conduct enforcement checks. Commuters who encounter such drivers can also file a report with LTA.,3,32,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00032

2023-02-27-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. I have two supplementary questions. Will social carpooling individuals be put in a difficult situation if LTA tightens regulations towards illegal carpooling and how effective is LTA's enforcement in differentiating between the two practices?,1,34,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00034
2023-02-27-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, as many carpooling groups can operate through chatgroups such as Telegram, how does the Ministry of Transport (MOT) intend to leverage technology and work with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) to monitor such groups?",2,35,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00035
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Firstly, as I have mentioned earlier, to ensure commuter safety, we have limited the matching of carpooling services with strangers to be done only via licensed carpooling operators or the smaller operators, that means business entities that are carpooling operators, because these operators maintain records of the drivers as well as the trips booked, in case of a dispute or an incident. In the past, we have had reports of disputes as well as assault cases arising from unregulated carpooling services.",1,36,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00036
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But social carpooling arrangements – generally made between friends or colleagues, typically no payment made – are permitted. LTA will only take enforcement actions against drivers who are found to have completed these carpooling trips with strangers for a fee that are matched through other channels besides the carpooling operators. And usually, this is taken either through public feedback or if LTA conducts enforcement operations that are targeted at these illegal carpooling activities. When we conduct operations, we need to get evidence that these completed trips are actually between strangers and are for a fee through a channel that is not through the carpooling operators, before we take action.",2,37,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00037
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,LTA will exercise reasonableness and will not intervene if they are purely social carpooling arrangements.,3,38,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00038
2023-02-27-T-003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Basically, if the driver provides trips through these chatgroups and has a valid vocational licence and drives a public service vehicle, then, that is not illegal and it is allowed. It is only not allowed if the driver does not have a valid vocational licence and does not drive a private hire car (PHC). Then, that would be illegal.",4,39,2023-02-27-T-003-S-00039
2023-02-27-T-004,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last three years, how many criminal offences are reported to the Police arising from illegal carpooling, beyond the offence of offering an illegal hitch ride; (b) for these offences, what are the five common crimes; and (c) whether these crimes are under-reported given the illegal nature of unregulated carpooling.",1,40,2023-02-27-T-004-S-00040

I just want to find out what is the age of the oldest block that has yet to be selected for HIP and where is that block located in, as far as constituency is concerned?

Because there is quite a number who are below 85 at the point of death, the figures are not given. But, otherwise, I think the main crux is that we do hear, anecdotally, many MediSave account holders who pass on with larger or quite significant amounts in their MediSave accounts. And therefore, an appeal for the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider whether we can allow greater MediSave deductions, especially those with chronic illnesses, rare diseases, as well as for exigencies, where they need to tap on the MediSave to pay, to prolong their life and make sure that they are adequately treated.",1,62,2023-02-27-T-007-S-00062

2023-02-27-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The second thing is that, we allow MediSave to be withdrawn in a lump sum for those who are terminally ill, up to a minimum balance of $5,000, under the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Boards Reduced Life Expectancy Terminally Ill scheme.

2023-02-27-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"And also, over the years, MOH has expanded MediSave, to allow for more flexibility for the elderly to use for their healthcare needs. For example, we have lowered the age for Flexi-MediSave from 65 to 60 in 2018, and we also increase the withdrawal limit from $200 to $300 per year in 2021 so that more can use Flexi-MediSave for outpatient treatments.",3,65,2023-02-27-T-007-S-00065

2023-02-27-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Government has conducted any studies to determine to what extent, when foreign worker quotas and access to Employment Pass or S Pass holders is tightened, will lead to firms hiring more Singaporeans, firms hiring Singaporeans at higher pay, firms hiring more Singaporeans at higher pay and business failures that lead to net job destruction over the following one year period; and (b) if not, whether the Government will consider studying this and make public the findings.",1,68,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00068
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"To ensure good employment outcomes for Singaporeans, it is important that our polices enable firms to access foreign workers who can complement the local workforce, so that firms can grow and can create more opportunities for locals.",1,69,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00069
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"To support policy-making, the Government regularly conducts impact assessment studies on a range of policies, and of course, this includes foreign workforce policies. The Government publishes some of these studies every quarter through the Economic Survey of Singapore.",2,70,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00070
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"One key finding of our internal studies on foreign workforce policies is that tightening access to lower-skilled foreign workers is more likely to have a positive impact on local employment outcomes, compared to tightening access to higher-skilled foreign workers. This is because businesses will then be able to substitute lower-skilled but cheaper foreign workers with locals, and therefore, improve their production processes accordingly. This has informed our approach of remaining open to high-quality, foreign professionals, while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of work permit holders through quotas and also levies.",3,71,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00071
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"It is important to note that these studies are but just one input to the policy-making process. These studies have their limitations, for example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects.",4,72,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00072
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"The impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period.

2023-02-27-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for that helpful reply. Just two clarifications or supplementary questions. Firstly, just to make sure that I have the right understanding. The Minister was saying that, based on the impact studies that have been conducted in the past, for lower-skilled workers, when the supply of foreign manpower, when that tap is tightened, that tends to lead to better employment outcomes for Singaporeans at the lower end of the wage scale – I just wanted to clarify that. Because that is an interesting finding.",1,75,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00075
2023-02-27-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For the other observation that the Minister made about the studies that for more highly-skilled foreign professionals, that that correlation does not really apply so much as it does to the lower-skilled workers. Would the right conclusion to draw from that, be that we, in Singapore, are not producing enough highly-skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating?",2,76,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00076
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The first point, in terms of the studies' findings for low-skilled workers, it is up to a certain point. The studies have shown that, if you tighten at the lower-skilled part, the net result is that we do get substitution and our locals can take on these jobs, but at slightly higher levels. To a point.",1,77,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00077
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Because of the size of our population and the size of our workforce, up to a point, if you continue to tighten, it can actually have a worse-off effect for the development of our country, in terms of our economic progress as well as industry development.",2,78,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00078
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"For the higher-skilled, again, you cannot infer from the studies that for higher-skilled workers, we are not doing enough to produce high calibre, local Singapore talent. We are already doing significantly more to improve their prospects, in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, and in upskilling and upgrading. But again, because of the fact that there are all these accelerating changes, economies and industries are evolving very rapidly, and coupled with that, significant disruptions that are happening.",3,79,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00079
2023-02-27-T-008,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, to keep pace and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we are ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward. I hope that answers the Member's question.",4,80,2023-02-27-T-008-S-00080

In one of MINDEF's surveys conducted among Singaporeans late last year, more than 98% of the respondents said that NS was necessary for Singapore's security, both now and in the future. It shows that Singaporeans understand that small states are inherently vulnerable, that we need to take responsibility for our own defence and that NS remains, I would say more than relevant – it remains critical.",5,224,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00224

2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Given low fertility rates and shrinking cohort sizes, the SAF needs to optimise the contributions of every soldier – in two ways. The first concerns medical fitness and job requirements. To complement our existing medical screening process, we introduced functional assessments for pre-enlistees with selected orthopaedic conditions. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for an update on this.",3,230,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00230
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Under this functional assessment, we assess the pre-enlistee's ability to do physical tasks such as running, jumping and carrying heavy loads. This approach allows us to accurately match more servicemen to operational roles as compared to the traditional approach of matching servicemen based only on their medical diagnosis.",4,231,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00231
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"To date, 100 pre-enlistees with certain orthopaedic conditions have undergone such functional assessments and 75 have been found to be fit to be deployed to a wider range of operational roles than before. At the same time, we are leveraging technology to redesign jobs. Similarly, this enables more servicemen to be deployed into operational roles.",5,232,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00232
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Since 2021, the SAF has redesigned 1,300 jobs in vocations such as Medics, Infantry Carrier Vehicle Operators and Transport Operators, opening them up to more servicemen. The SAF is on track to do the same for another 500 jobs by the middle of this year and that will bring it from 1,300, to 1,800 jobs.",6,233,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00233
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"The second way is to maximise contributions that concern knowledge and skills. To keep up with the changing nature of conflict and emerging threats, the SAF needs to grow and tap the skills of our national servicemen. In this, we have made good progress.",7,234,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00234
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"I have updated the House in recent years about Work-Learn Schemes for full-time national servicemen (NSFs), a subject which Mr Don Wee asked about.

2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"A major administrative burden for employers and NSmen had been the filing of Make-Up Pay claims for In-Camp Training (ICT). In the past, this was done manually. Entries were therefore sometimes incomplete and payment delays happened.",18,245,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00245
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"In September last year, we introduced an automated system that draws income-related information from CPF Board and IRAS to calculate Make-Up Pay amounts. If they so wish, employers and NSmen can review the computed amounts and file for adjustments. Otherwise, the amounts will be paid out automatically and there is no action needed on their part.",19,246,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00246
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"As a result, we have had very positive feedback. The claim amounts derived from CPF Board and IRAS data have proven to be up to date and accurate. Since September, 92% of claims have been processed automatically. Based on our estimates, the automated system will save employers, NSmen, MINDEF and MHA more than 260,000 man-hours of processing effort every year. Apart from saving time, the automation has also allowed us to make payment much faster. Since September, 90% of claims have been paid within 10 days from the start of in-camp training (ICT). Practically, the payment is processed while people may still be undergoing their period of ICT.",20,247,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00247
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Alongside this automated system, we also introduced a base NS pay of $1,600 per month whenever NSmen attend ICT or other operationally-ready NS (ORNS) activities. This means that if the data from CPF Board or IRAS indicates that an NSman earns less than $1,600 per month, MINDEF will top up his NS Pay to $1,600 per month, prorated according to the duration of the ORNS activity. As an example, if an NSman attends a 12-day ICT, on a prorated basis of a base pay of $1,600, he would be paid at least $600.",21,248,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00248
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,This provides additional support to NSmen who are students or who are not employed or whose income from informal jobs may not be fully captured in CPF or IRAS data. We hope that this gives NSmen from lower-income segments greater financial security when they attend ORNS activities.,22,249,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00249
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"On this, I just want to reiterate the point that MINDEF is fully committed to the well-being and welfare of our national servicemen, both NSFs and NSmen. Through so many examples that we have given, the public can be confident that we will regularly update such benefits in order to take good care of our servicemen.",23,250,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00250

2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"With the change, national servicemen are now able to receive, carry and redeem their credits via their mobile devices. The credits can be used with any business that accepts payment by NETS or PayNow QR. Some businesses also offer our servicemen discounts for the use of the credits as a show of support for National Service. When they do so, this has effectively further raised the dollar value of the benefits.",26,253,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00253
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"As part of the NS55 Recognition Package, $100 worth of credits were distributed electronically in July last year to more than a million national servicemen past and present. When we checked in mid-February 2023, the 136,000 national servicemen who had rated the NS55 redemption eService on LifeSG app had given it an average of 4.8 out of five stars.",27,254,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00254
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Over the past seven months, 76% of national servicemen have started using or have already used their credits fully. This is a relevant piece of data because it shows that when it is made available to be used electronically, it makes it much more convenient and it speeds up the utilisation and the enjoyment of the benefit. In comparison, it took 18 months to achieve the same use for physical vouchers when we did that for NS50. I encourage all national servicemen to fully utilise your credits.",28,255,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00255
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,Ms Poh Li San asked about the use of the OneNS platform to improve the NS experience. The OneNS platform is a consolidation of NS-related services and transactions into a single mobile app. We rolled out the first phase of OneNS to selected ICT units. NSmen in these units can register their attendance at ICT easily with the geo-location function on the app. This has allowed the units concerned to start the proper ICT programme earlier. OneNS will be extended to more units in the coming months.,29,256,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00256
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"I now move on to the third thrust, which is that of enhancing recognition and support for national servicemen, something which Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked about.",30,257,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00257
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Last year, we conducted a year-long NS55 campaign themed ""Generations of Strength"". Mr Mohd Fahmi asked about the response to that campaign.

2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"As an example, the NS55 theme song ""Back in the Day"" accumulated over six million views online. The showcase at the Army Open House on the evolution of NS attracted 140,000 visitors. The community came together to organise activities such as walking alongside our national servicemen under the NS55 Fitness Challenge.",32,259,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00259
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"All in all, the NS55 campaign achieved its objectives. Surveys conducted after the campaign showed that 80% of our national servicemen felt valued for their contributions to NS. And 90% of the general public felt that NS was a source of pride for Singapore.",33,260,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00260
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"NS55 may have concluded but our efforts to recognise and support our national servicemen and their families continue. In fact, we can already look forward to the opening of the new SAFRA clubhouse in Choa Chu Kang in May this year. That will bring an exciting host of amenities, especially to the 90,000 NSmen who reside in the northwest. I think many of us might have seen the exciting photos of my colleague, Senior Minister of State Zaqy's recent hard-hat tour of the upcoming facilities. So, look out for that.",34,261,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00261
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Beyond recognition benefits, MINDEF and MHA are also committed to strengthening financial protection for SAF and Home Team servicemen and volunteers. In January, we doubled the coverage for the Group Term Life and Group Personal Accident insurance, up from $150,000 to $300,000. We have also extended the coverage to conditions such as long-term hearing damage and decompression sickness.

2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,Representatives from the SAF also attend international defence safety conferences in order to share experiences and also to gain insights on safety benchmarks and practices.

The audit findings show that the SAF's safety management systems remain robust despite the ramp-up of training over the past year following pandemic-related disruptions.,43,270,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00270
2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"I announced last year that the SAF was developing an enterprise Safety Information System. It has been fully adopted in the SAF, allowing quick spreading of safety lessons and easy submission of near misses and incidents by personnel across all ranks.

2023-02-27-T-012,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"First, in an effort to improve NS processes further, we have reviewed exit controls for NSmen and concluded that we are able to further relax them. From April this year onwards, NSmen will only need to apply for an Exit Permit when they leave Singapore for 12 months or more, up from the current six months or more. This change reflects the growing mobility of Singaporeans, with many of our NSmen staying or working overseas for longer durations.",47,274,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00274

2023-02-27-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),The world has been awed by the sheer courage and ingenuity of Ukrainians in their spirited fight against Russia.

Then, local business owners, specialising in everything from furniture to metalwork, came together to properly manufacture bullet-proof jackets sewn with camouflage fabric and tool pouches. Bullet-proof jackets are common apparel in Ukraine now. There are reports of farmers wearing them while working fields that are peppered with unexploded munitions and parents preparing them for children in the event of evacuations.",7,285,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00285

2023-02-27-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"Through our review, we have identified two key priorities. The first is to help Singaporeans become more aware about the threats and challenges for our society, which would serve as a stepping-stone towards understanding how they can contribute to tackling these challenges. The second is to give Singaporeans more opportunities to propose Total Defence initiatives and to partner the government to implement these initiatives.",13,291,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00291

For example, university students Mr Caleb Tan and Mr Sheng Jiankai drew on their love of crime fiction to propose an immersive Total Defence Murder Mystery Role Play Game to help players learn about our multi-faceted threat environment. Mr Tan said that through their game, they hoped that young Singaporeans would become more aware of the challenges and limitations that Singapore faces, and feel the urgency to take tangible actions for Total Defence. We think that their idea is fresh and engaging, and have partnered them with the Singapore Discovery Centre to bring their game to life.",15,293,2023-02-27-T-012-S-00293

For example, most of us are familiar with the National Cadet Corps (NCC). Some of us may have been part of the NCC when we were in school. I, for one, was an NCC cadet too, at one point. Like many students over the years, this gave me early exposure to Total Defence and prepared me with relevant skills for NS.

2023-02-27-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"A key source of geo-political uncertainty is the growing US-China rivalry. The hope for many of us is that both the US and China find a way to co-exist together. As the two largest economic powers, their peaceful co-existence could allow Asia and the rest of the world to continue to prosper in peace.",2,332,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00332
2023-02-27-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Unfortunately, this rivalry seems to have grown and intensified over the years. Last year, US Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in the face of objections and threats of dire consequences from China. The message she wanted to send as clear – that the US stands firmly behind its ally Taiwan. China responded with joint military exercises in the Taiwan straits and unprecedented missile overflights over Taiwan. While this rivalry had started out as a largely economic one, the risk of a military confrontation has suddenly also become more real.",3,333,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00333
2023-02-27-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The economic rivalry itself should not be underestimated. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, there was a wave of US investment into China and trade from China with the world blossomed. This was like a golden age for economic prosperity following the end of the Cold War.",4,334,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00334
2023-02-27-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The last few years though have marked a sharp reversal of this trend. As the rivalry between China and the US intensified, US companies have started leaving China. Amazon, Yahoo and Linked-In are the latest companies to announce exits from China, following Google which exited more than a decade ago. Prior to this, other well known names such as Macy’s, Home Depot, eBay and Best Buy have entered and exited China.",5,335,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00335

2023-02-27-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"This rivalry has also manifested itself in the realm of critical technologies. For example, the US last year, imposed restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductor chips, especially those with wide applications in artificial intelligence to China. While these measures are not targeted at Singapore, our semi-conductor industry could potentially be impacted given the highly complex nature of semi-conductor supply chains. In a more general dial-back of trade liberalisation, the last few years have seen both countries announce trade restrictions and sanctions against entities and individuals on both sides.",7,337,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00337

Neither side expect relations to improve anytime soon and there is a risk of things worsening quickly.",1,344,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00344
2023-02-27-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The Prime Minister noted that more geopolitical contestation was likely in the Asia-Pacific and that some countries would choose a side.

2023-02-27-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Chairman, it is often said that foreign policy begins at home. In view of the realities of our external environment and the multiracial character of Singapore, it is a reality that our social compact can be susceptible to fissure and cracks because of geopolitical tensions. Beneath the cordial and friendly nature of Singaporeans, the large number of foreigners, our ethnic and racial make-up and the number of new citizens in our economy can easily be exploited as a fault line. This may make it more difficult for the population to be psychologically prepared for a far more contentious and unpredictable external environment. I have alluded to this prospect at previous Committee of Supply (COS) debates.",4,347,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00347

The reality of a far more complex and diverse Singapore then ever before can make this feel like a tall order. But it would be important to see ourselves as Singaporeans first, ahead of our ethnic differences, even as the latter define who we are culturally.",5,348,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00348
2023-02-27-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"We should not shy away from saying that we are Singaporeans first, while recognising and honouring our ethnic and racial realities.

2023-02-27-T-013,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"One year ago, Russia launched a full-scale invasion on the small sovereign state of Ukraine. One year on, the war is still raging. Two years ago, the coup in Myanmar started and today, the violence is reportedly getting worse. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between the US and China have intensified and Taiwan, which is the red line for China, is constantly being ""put to the test"". And, alas, if there were any dreams for peace in the Korean Peninsula post the Kim-Trump Summit, those have fast faded into the distance. We have experienced supply chain disruptions since the COVID-19 pandemic and these are further exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war especially for food and energy. Inflation is at a 14-year high, and across the globe, we see increasing protectionism.",2,351,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00351

We are a small nation and may, at times, have to walk a tight rope. It is pertinent that Singapore does not falter but firmly stick to principles and abide by global rules-based multilateral system, whether for international security or for international trade.

Kudos to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) colleagues here and in the overseas Missions for establishing strong diplomatic relationships with many countries. Singapore is not simply a fair-weather friend. I read with pride The Straits Times article on how our Singapore men from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) responded to a request by Turkey and took part in the rescue operations in Southern Turkey which was hit by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 6 February.

In the US, there has also been a deep shift in attitudes towards China.

The US has identified computing-related technologies, biotech and clean tech as force multipliers throughout the technological ecosystem and emphasised leadership in each of these arenas as a national security imperative.

Our open economy is highly dependent on doing business with the entire world and we have benefitted greatly from being a vital node in globalised supply chains. The US is the largest foreign investor in Singapore and our top trading partner for services. But we are also one of the largest investors in China, which is our top trading partner in goods.

Whilst neither the US nor China seek a military conflict over Taiwan, missteps or mishaps can easily trigger a cycle of tit-for-tat actions and reactions that spiral dangerously out of control.

This will ensure that the present and future air traffic to Changi Airport and nearby Indonesian airports continue to be managed safely and efficiently. The DCA will enhance cooperation and interaction between our two military forces. It will provide clarity for the SAF's training in Indonesian archipelagic and territorial waters and airspace, on a basis that fully respects Indonesia's sovereignty over its territory, while preserving Singapore's rights under UNCLOS. Finally, the ET will strengthen cooperation between our law enforcement agencies to combat crime and to complement our existing cooperation with Indonesia.

Singapore has always advocated engaging major players so that they all have a stake in the peace, stability and development of our region, and can create a stable balance of power in the Asia Pacific. This provides small countries like Singapore more room for manoeuvre than if there was only a single power dominating our region. Naturally, we do not want the major powers to make Asia their battleground or conduct proxy wars here. Instead, we want them to be engaged constructively – politically and economically – so as to enhance regional cooperation, development and security.

ASEAN-led mechanisms like the East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Plus Three, and the Plus-One summits bring major powers including the US, China, Russia, India, Japan, the European Union (EU) and Australia to the same table convened by ASEAN. Our external partners also want to do more with ASEAN. Last year ASEAN upgraded its relations with the US and India to Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships, after doing the same with China and Australia the year before. ASEAN also signed the Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement with the EU in October 2022. We therefore welcome the interest of major powers to take clear stakes in our region and in our prosperity, and to engage ASEAN on our own merits.",36,524,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00524

Mr Gerald Giam asked if we are looking at alternative options for decision making, when consensus is difficult or hindered. The need for consensus is in fact, a design feature, it is not a bug, precisely because of the great diversity within ASEAN. No other regional association has the level of diversity that ASEAN represents. Nevertheless, the ASEAN Charter does provide for decision making at the Leaders' level, even if there are profound political problems in a member state. For example, we have not allowed the coup in Myanmar to paralyse ASEAN or to hold the rest of us hostage.",37,525,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00525

We also diversify our trade relationships through regional arrangements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – that is ASEAN-10, plus China, Australia, New Zealand, Korea (ROK) and Japan. We have also substantially completed the negotiations for the Mercosur-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and we have also signed on to the Pacific Alliance-Singapore FTA.

Last September, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Vivian, Minister Gan Kim Yong and Minister S Iswaran were in New Delhi to participate in the inaugural India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) with their Indian counterparts. This leaders-driven platform allows both sides to explore potential collaboration in emerging areas such as food security, energy and green projects, and digitalisation, including enhancing digital connectivity. On 21 February 2023, Prime Minister Lee and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the linkage of the Singapore's PayNow and India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Certainly, we are always very concerned to the escalation of violence there. We are saddened by the loss of lives on both sides. There can be no justification for attacks on innocent civilians. Both Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live in peace and security. Singapore has been steadfast in our support for a negotiated two-state solution that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions. As a friend of both sides, we continue to urge both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to return to direct negotiations. A two-state solution requires both sides to have the political will to negotiate with each other in good faith and make the necessary concessions. The recent decision by Israeli government to retroactively legitimise nine outposts in the West Bank is deeply worrying. Such unilateral moves will only further heighten tensions and undermine any prospect for peace. We urge all parties to avoid taking further unilateral actions. The status quo at the Temple Mount/Haram Al Sharif should be maintained.

From what I understood, there was an ASEAN decision to exclude Myanmar's junta leaders from ASEAN-level meetings because of disappointment with the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus. I think that decision was taken in November last year.",1,624,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00624

2023-02-27-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"So, two questions concerning this  one, could the Minister confirm our reasons for not wanting to attend this meeting? And secondly, does he think that the fact that some ASEAN Foreign Ministers attended shows that there is actually a difference of opinion or approach on how ASEAN should approach Myanmar's junta leaders and the situation in Myanmar in general?",4,627,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00627
2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Thank you. Two good questions. Let me take a step back. What is happening in Myanmar is a tragedy. It is not something that can be fixed externally. If you think about Myanmar since independence – if you go back 70, 80 years, the end of the Second World War – unlike the rest of us, they have never been able to forge a single, all-encompassing consensus on identity and bringing all the component parts together.",1,628,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00628

2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Having said that, we must also be very clear that we do not believe in foreign interference in domestic affairs.

2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"We must understand that although we clearly disapprove of the coup and we do not recognise the current military junta in Myanmar, it does not give ASEAN a licence to interfere in its domestic affairs.

2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The reason for that is because Myanmar remains a member of ASEAN and we do want it to continue to enjoy the benefits of membership to the extent possible within the constraints of its own domestic politics. We want it to be able to access information which is available to ASEAN. That is why we say, ""We are not keeping any secrets from you. You have a seat at the table"".",8,635,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00635

2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"First of all, it was not an ASEAN meeting. It was a bilateral meeting between Thailand and presumably the junta leaders.

The first thing I should say is Bangladesh has in fact been extremely generous all these years in hosting and supporting the refugees. If you had gone to that camp, you would also have noticed that there are multiple agencies, multiple UN agencies and in fact, other countries also, who are providing assistance.",1,648,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00648
2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Unfortunately, the real solution is not just assistance at the camp – even though that is urgent and essential.

2023-02-27-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I asked, has Singapore ever pushed at the ASEAN Summit for a decision to be taken by a vote on issues where arriving at a consensus is impossible? As the Minister alluded, this is provided for in Article 22 of the ASEAN Charter. Just now, the Minister mentioned that Myanmar's participation at the political level was reduced. Was that decision to bar Myanmar's participation at the political level arrived at by consensus or was it a vote?",2,653,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00653
2023-02-27-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"More fundamentally, is Singapore open to considering alternative decision-making mechanisms at ASEAN? Or is MFA's position that sticking to the consensus decision-making approach in all cases best serves Singapore's interests? The Minister has stated that decision by consensus in ASEAN is a feature, it is not a bug. However, does the Minister agree that sometimes features do not work well in all situations?",3,654,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00654

No other regional organisation – if you just look at the 10 of us or soon to be 11, has the great diversity in the economy, forms of government, you have got absolute monarchies, constitutional monarchies, democracies of various shades and sometimes even outcomes of coups. If you look at language, culture, religion – there is no other regional organisation that I can think of with that range of diversity. So, that is the first point – to understand that.",1,655,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00655
2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Then, we go back in history – why the consensus principle? It has everything to do with diversity.

2023-02-27-T-013,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, you are right. When consensus is abused, it becomes an avenue for everyone to take hostages and to, loosely, threaten a veto.

But, actually, in practice, knowing that you have to seek consensus creates a whole level of additional consultations, negotiations, compromises, imaginative diplomacy, which would not be present if everyone had easy access to just majoritarian voting.",3,657,2023-02-27-T-013-S-00657

I commend the Singapore Prison Services (SPS) for spearheading efforts with its stakeholders to keep the recividism rate amongst desisters relatively low and stable.

This will not be easy but has to be done. I understand that SPS has, over the years, built a substantial number of volunteers who are roped in to help with reintegration support for prison inmates and desisters. I believe that there is a case for SPS and its volunteers to partner the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Ministry of National Development (MND) and other Government agencies to co-create bespoke plans for each desister that has a series of incentives and disincentives during the supervision period of desisters. The purpose is to motivate desisters to be responsible family members and encourage reconciliation within their families.

We need to get behind them and signal to them that we will support them so long as they keep on the path of rehabilitation and reintegration. Early last year, I suggested in this House that our desisters be given an opportunity to perform at our National Day Parade. Having seen them perform, I know that they will be a hit amongst Singaporeans. I understood that my suggestion was made too late for National Day Parade (NDP) 2022.

2023-02-27-T-014,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Over the years, the Government has taken steps to deal with different types of harmful online content and behaviours. We introduced the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act and the Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act.

They may feature a range of virtual items of value, which a player may win with varying probabilities. We allow games with such loot boxes via a class licensing regime, but only if the game fulfils either of two conditions. The loot box within the game must be entirely free of charge to play.

I thank Minister Mrs Josephine Teo for her explanation on how we are using drones and unmanned surveillance equipment. My humble suggestion is that that not substitute the need for good human ground judgement in order to know how to prevent crime and also disperse crowds.

This emergency self-service ""kill switch"" allows customers to suspend their accounts quickly, if compromised. But this is their own account. As noted by Mr Christopher de Souza, what happens often is that the original sum of monies from the bank account, customer's account, gets dismantled, dispersed and then, goes through the banking system into various other bank accounts not owned by them. So, while the bank account, the original bank account holder, the victim has activated the ""kill switch"" for his or her own account, it has not stopped the monies from being transferred to other accounts.",1,1016,2023-02-27-T-014-S-01016

Eighty-nine bank accounts. That was how quickly bank accounts were set up and the monies is dispersed through the banking system. And that is why it is important that we work with the various retail banks to have the retail banks co-located together so that we can share information quickly and for the banks to quickly trace the monies and close off those bank accounts and stop the monies from moving through the banking system and then, out of Singapore, whereby it is then out of our jurisdiction.",3,1018,2023-02-27-T-014-S-01018

2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mediation can preserve and often even strengthen the relationship between neighbours by providing them with a platform, in the hands of a very good trained mediator, to resolve their disputes amicably, in very much a win-win-fashion.",26,1206,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01206
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Our experience has shown us that mediation is not just more effective, it is also quicker and cheaper. The data shows that mediation has been, by and large, successful.",27,1207,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01207
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We, therefore, believe that most community dispute cases will benefit from mediation. More than 80% of the voluntary mediation cases handled at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) were successfully settled. This number, of course, has got to be taken in context. It is for parties who voluntarily go to mediation, so they might perhaps be more predisposed to having an amicable resolution between themselves. Nonetheless, this statistic tells us that putting cases through mediation, at least as the first port of call, will likely yield effective results.",28,1208,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01208
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Part of the problem is that these voluntary cases handled at CMC represent a minority of the cases as many neighbours do not make this attempt at mediation. To provide specific figures, less than 30% of such voluntary cases proceed to mediation. In other words, of all cases that go to the CMC on neighbour disputes – usually on noise – less than 30% go on to voluntary mediation and of this, 80% of that number of cases are resolved amicably.",29,1209,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01209
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"This, as I said earlier, could in part be because mediation is currently voluntary.

2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, mediation would be mandatory for certain types of community disputes and penalties will be imposed for not attending mandatory mediation.

2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Third, as I said earlier, we will, in general, require disputing neighbours to undergo mediation before they file a case at CDRT.

2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"After we make mediation mandatory, the 80% figure that I said earlier may well come down, it may not be as high because you will now be including in this group of mediated cases, those cases where parties do not want or do not wish to find a solution amongst themselves.",35,1215,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01215
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Nonetheless, it is important to provide parties with that platform to seek an amicable resolution; and it can still be highly effective in the hands of a good mediator, and with some public education.

2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In many cases, part of the reluctance to go to mediation is because you are having a dispute with your neighbour three feet away and you do not want to get into a bus all the way down to the CBD about 45 minutes away, to do the mediation.",39,1219,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01219
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"So, we believe in that.

2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"So, to give Members some idea of the numbers, from around 5,400 practitioners in 2017 to around 6,400 practitioners in 2022. That said, when we looked at the trends and did a more granular review, it is apparent that, although it is increasing, but the rate of increase of the number of qualified practising lawyers has come down. So, it is increasing but the rate of increase has slowed. And, in part, this is due to a decrease in the number of returning overseas law graduates and also, as Mr Tan pointed out, an increase in attrition.",93,1273,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01273
2023-02-27-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"But at the same time, I would say attrition from private practice is not new. Those of us who are lawyers and have been in practice for a while, would have seen the trend, even from before. It is not a new phenomenon. Lawyers now, in fact, today, have more options than in the past and can leave private practice but still contribute within the legal sector. They can join the Government. They can join legal tech companies. They can enter academia. And like Mr Patrick Tay said earlier, greatly boosting legal services as in-house corporate counsel. And the lawyers who leave practice carry with them that experience from practice into these other fields which are adjunct to practice but also serving the legal industry. This is not necessarily a bad outcome, because we need legal talent to support all aspects of our economy and our society.",94,1274,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01274

This ensures that any delay in processing the payment or issuing the receipt does not result in an appellant missing out on the filing deadlines.",37,1331,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01331
2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Besides these enhancements, there are two further areas that we have worked on, to make family justice more accessible to SRPs. First, we try to ensure information on court processes and procedures is readily available. The Courts publish on their website comprehensive information about court processes and procedures.",38,1332,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01332
2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),FJC also published a case management guidebook which guides SRPs through the divorce process and a guidebook on common family court orders.,39,1333,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01333

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Second, there are online tools and resources that SRPs may find useful. Besides Divorce AIDE that I mentioned earlier, the Legal Aid Bureau's iLAB chatbot provides tailored legal information on divorce, family violence, and issues related to employment. It is also able to generate simple legal documents. In the past year, information on civil cases was added to iLAB. Currently, there are 10 topics in iLAB.",41,1335,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01335

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"An area of attention is the current challenges in enforcing maintenance orders, a point mentioned by Mr Murali Pillai. Non-compliance with maintenance orders has an adverse impact on those who are relying on the maintenance payments to go about their daily lives. Unresolved disputes over maintenance also hinder the parties from moving forward with their lives.",45,1339,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01339
2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"I would like to share the story of Ms B, a divorced working mother with two young children. Upon divorce, the ex-husband was ordered to make monthly maintenance payments to Ms B for the two children. After a few months, the ex-husband began missing payments. At one point, he had failed to make payment for more than five months. The situation caused Ms B great distress – she had to cover the substantial costs of the children's school fees, transport and daily necessities. In less than a year, Ms B filed two applications to enforce the maintenance order. She had to spend considerable time and was unable to afford a lawyer to aid her in the proceedings, given her financial responsibilities to her children.",46,1340,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01340
2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The proposed reforms will make the enforcement of maintenance orders simpler and more efficient. For example, in the current process, parties have to make several trips to court. The reforms aim to streamline proceedings and reduce the number of trips that parties make to Court. This will reduce the burden on those without lawyers. We will provide more details in due course.",47,1341,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01341

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Responding to Mr Patrick Tay, the data is encouraging. Since its operationalisation on 1 June 2021, more than 90% of the Protection Order (PO) and False Statement Order applications filed were on the simplified track. Anecdotally, the majority of cases are handled by the litigants, without the need for legal representation.",49,1343,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01343
2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"There has been a significant increase in the number of PO applications, as well as orders granted. From 2019 to 2020, 319 PO applications were filed; 146 POs were granted in that period. From 2021 to 2022, there were 924 PO applications filed – 866 applications were filed from the operationalisation of the PHC on 1 June 2021 to 31 December 2022.",50,1344,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01344

Applications may be withdrawn because parties reached an out of court resolution, or the claimant decided there is no longer a need for a PO. The remaining 209 PO applications are either pending resolution or were dismissed. Where urgent relief is sought, the PHC generally hears the application within two to three working days from the date of application.",51,1345,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01345

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Members should note that one case may involve more than one type of harassment. Out of the 866 PO applications filed from 1 June 2021 to 31 December 2022, 304 cases involved cyberbullying; 295 cases involved doxxing; 203 cases involved workplace harassment; 103 cases involved sexual harassment; and 75 cases involved harassment by debt collectors, moneylenders or creditors.",53,1347,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01347

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"As explained in a Written Reply to Mr Pillai's question in Parliament previously, as part of due process, the Courts will usually require the respondent's side of the story to determine whether the claim is indeed frivolous or vexatious. We should also be mindful that many claimants in the PHC are SRPs, so the bar cannot be placed too high. Otherwise, this could inadvertently prevent access to justice for them.",55,1349,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01349
2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"On the other hand, the PHC has powers to deal with frivolous or vexatious cases. For claims filed through simplified proceedings, the PHC has powers to make such orders and directions as it thinks fit for the just, expeditious and economic disposal of a case. The PHC therefore may, notwithstanding that the proceedings were already simplified, deal with a case which is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process in an expedited way.",56,1350,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01350

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Further, the PHC can award costs and disbursements against a claimant who brings a frivolous or vexatious case.

2023-02-27-T-015,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Patrick Tay touched on workers of insolvent companies. This issue has been addressed on numerous occasions in this House. Exposure to business risks is something all companies face. When these risks eventuate and a company gets into trouble, a restructuring aims to provide the company space to recover. The Court supervises the restructuring process to balance the interests of the various stakeholders, including employees. If the company is successfully rehabilitated, workers are more likely to hold on to their jobs.",72,1366,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01366

Out of the nine categories of claims under section 203, five categories give priority to workers. The only categories with priority over worker claims are the costs and expenses of winding up. These are necessary for the winding up to proceed smoothly. In fact, worker claims rank above claims by the Government in respect of tax assessed and goods and services tax due.",73,1367,2023-02-27-T-015-S-01367

One key aspect is that when Judges are appointed, they must have security of tenure, meaning that they cannot be removed from office until they reach a certain age or, in some countries, until they die.

The suggestion to move the age when tenure ends from 65 to 70 years is actually a very modest one, if one looks at how life expectancy in Singapore has changed over the decades. The current retirement age of 65 years was introduced way back in 1969, more than half a century ago, when the life expectancy in Singapore was 67.6 years. Just consider that – in 1969, a Judge retiring at 65 years then, statistically had just a few more years to live.

So, the further extensions in the different forms that I have outlined, gives them the choice.",1,1464,2023-02-27-T-016-S-01464
2023-02-27-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On Ms Lim's first point, the Chief Justice says that when a Judge reaches 65, he is ordinarily offered an extension up to 68. But that is not the same as mandating that. So, ordinarily offered does not mean that in all these cases, it is accepted. There is still an option for a Judge to take one or more of the routes that I have indicated, such as being appointed as a Senior Judge instead, or perhaps taking on a case, depending on his or her preference on the caseload schedule.",2,1465,2023-02-27-T-016-S-01465
