2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),NEA requires LTA's contractors to carry out localised noise impact assessments prior to the commencement of all major infrastructure projects. LTA conducted a noise impact assessment at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 in 2019 prior to the commencement of North South Corridor (NSC) construction works.,2,3,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00003
2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"LTA and its contractors have taken various measures to mitigate the impact of construction noise. These include erecting noise barriers and noise enclosures, installing mufflers on machineries, using rubber mallets for hammering and carrying out noisier works in the day. However, safety critical works such as the construction of diaphragm walls have to be conducted continuously, which could include working through the night. In such instances, LTA and the Contractors will notify affected stakeholders through circulars and social media platforms.",3,4,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00004
2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),LTA regularly engages residents to inform them of the progress of the project. We seek the understanding of all stakeholders for the NSC project which will enhance connectivity between the North to the City Centre for all residents when completed.,4,5,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00005

2023-03-03-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. Will the Ministry consider more targeted and frequent noise monitoring at residential developments, which are affected by multiple construction projections managed by different agencies, as the noise can be amplified by these different things that are happening on the ground?",1,7,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00007
2023-03-03-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"For instance, Nuovo and Castle Green condominiums along Avenue 6 are affected by noise from the NSC, the MRT line, as well as the BTO construction, all happening within the same vicinity. Will the Ministry of Transport (MOT) also consider constructing noise barriers along the MRT lines near these residential projects?",2,8,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00008
2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. There are two parts to this. Firstly, for construction noise, for all construction projects, if they are near residential projects or noise-sensitive facilities, NEA requires these projects to have noise meters installed throughout the projects' duration to monitor the noise levels. And all contractors are required to mitigate the impact of the noise and not exceed the levels stipulated.",1,9,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00009
2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For LTA projects, we go beyond that, in the sense that we do everything that is possible, particularly in major projects like the NSC project, which is a national, major project. We do as much as possible to mitigate noise from the construction. To do this, we erect noise barriers at source, at the construction site near to these residential developments, including like the Member cited – Nuovo condominium, for instance. There are noise barriers that are as high as is practicable, and all the other measures – noise enclosures, mufflers for the heavy machinery and equipment, and so on.",2,10,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00010
2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But the reality would be that it is really not possible to mitigate all noise. We do as much as we can. When there is a need, for instance, for deep excavation, pouring of concrete continuously for the diaphragm walls, we will have to do it through the night and then, we will have to inform the stakeholders.",3,11,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00011
2023-03-03-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to construction of noise barriers along MRT lines, the noise impact assessment studies, for instance that we did in 2018, was to look at certain stretches along the MRT lines and identify where the noise exceeds the recommended level by NEA. For those stretches, noise barriers will be constructed – that is for rail noise. Then, for construction noise, it is barriers and mitigation at source.",4,12,2023-03-03-T-001-S-00012
2023-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government has conducted any research to understand the number of children that Singaporean women would like to have and the reasons why this may be different from the number they actually do have; and (b) if not, whether it will consider doing so and publishing the findings of the fertility gap and the reasons for it.",1,13,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00013

2023-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I thank the Minister for replying. I have two supplementary questions.,1,18,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00018
2023-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The first is regarding the survey and the data that she referred to, is this data publicly available and can Singaporeans study the statistical fertility gap within that survey, the gap between the number of children women want to have and how many they actually have? And does that data provide reasons for that gap, including all possible reasons such as housing affordability, for one, which has been discussed before in this House, where there is evidence from another study by an NUS researcher that there is a correlation between high house prices and low total fertility rate (TFR)?",2,19,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00019
2023-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The second supplementary question is, does this study contain – and if not, could future studies address – differences between different segments in Singapore? Because that may be a source of policy ideas if we look at outliers where there are certain segments be it by income or by other characteristics —",3,20,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00020
2023-03-03-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Perera, can you keep it concise, please.",1,21,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00021
2023-03-03-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Yes. Where the TFR is higher or the TFR is lower. In America, for example, some research shows higher-income, better educated women have more children. So, can that information also be made available so that we can have a whole-of-society approach to address what is really an existential issue?",1,22,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00022
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his clarifications. The survey results are, in fact, publicly available. Mr Perera may have missed them, but they are available. They were published by the Prime Minister's Office, so the survey is available online. I would encourage him to have a look at it.",1,23,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00023
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"You will see when you look the survey that it actually contains quite a lot of information. The survey was conducted from February to June 2021, with respondents comprising 2,848 single – that means, never married – and 3,017 married Singapore residents, aged 21 to 45 years. In the annex to the survey, there are details of the profile of survey respondents.",2,24,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00024
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The highlights of the survey do not indicate housing prices, as Mr Perera mentioned. What was key on their mind were other reasons and let me just highlight them.",3,25,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00025
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The first thing among the key findings was that marriage and parenthood aspirations remained strong. So, Singaporeans do want to get married and do want to have children. In terms of the factors that affected having children, the survey showed that in making parenthood decisions, key considerations included the ability to manage the costs of child-raising as well as to manage work and family commitments. Another key consideration was that fathers were equally important as caregivers and could play a greater role at home. And the third key finding was that many agreed that Flexible Work Arrangements make it easier for couples to start a family and have more children.",4,26,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00026
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, we do understand that for young couples starting family, having a home is important and you would have seen that in the Budget, the measures to prioritise first-timer families, young families and married couples, are aimed at ensuring that they have a home. And we have had a whole debate on affordability and accessibility. Singaporeans can rest assured that that is very much on our minds and we are making sure that housing is available for those who wish to start families and have children.",5,27,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00027
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But the other findings, which were the key findings from this, you can see that this year's Budget, in particular, the Marriage and Parenthood measures are targeted squarely at that. The measures are directed towards financial support for parents. So, the increase in the Baby Bonus cash gift, the CDA top-up, the in the enhancement of the CDA co-matching. That addresses the financial concern. We have doubled the Government-Paid Paternity Leave, which addresses this finding that they wish to see more involvement of the fathers. And the other, which was said in the Budget, and actually, we have said many times but has not yet received as much attention is the Flexible Work Arrangements.",6,28,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00028
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Flexible Work Arrangements are sometimes confused with work from home. But it is not equal to work from home. Work from home is a subset of Flexible Work Arrangements, which is a much broader thing. This I think is what would help parents the most – that sense that they would be able to take time off or to be able to arrange their work in such a way that allows them to care for young children. Also bearing in mind that many parents also have to look after their own parents, the grandparents.",7,29,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00029
2023-03-03-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, Flexible Work Arrangements will be key and hence, that is why in my earlier answer, I indicated that we need a whole-of-society approach, where everyone is supportive or families and family well-being.",8,30,2023-03-03-T-002-S-00030
2023-03-03-T-003,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will consider reducing the property tax rates for owner-occupied private residential properties occupied by elderly retirees who have been unduly affected by the escalating rental of neighbouring units, which disproportionately affects their properties' annual value.",1,31,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00031
2023-03-03-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) for the past three years, what is the annual average rate of increase of property tax for owner-occupied private properties in both prime and non-prime locations respectively; (b) whether the annual property tax computation is influenced by the use of neighbouring properties for rental income; and (c) whether the Ministry will review the property tax computation for prime locations so that owners of these owner-occupied homes, especially retirees, are not unfairly penalised.",1,32,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00032
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 3 and 4 together?",1,33,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00033

2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you, Sir. Property tax or PT, is our primary means of taxing wealth. PT payable is based on the applicable PT rate, applied to the Annual Value or AV of the property, where AV is a proxy for the property value and thus, the owner's wealth.",1,35,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00035
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"In line with the wealth tax intent of PT, the PT on residential properties is taxed on a progressive schedule. Properties with AVs of up to $8,000 pay no PT, while properties with higher AVs pay PT at progressively higher rates of taxation. Owner-occupied residential properties enjoy concessionary PT rates and are taxed at rates lower than non-owner-occupied ones.",2,36,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00036
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, over the years, the Government has received feedback, including from Members from both sides of this House, to enhance our wealth taxes. This is what we have been doing.",3,37,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00037
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As announced in Budget 2022, PT rates have been raised for higher-end owner-occupied residential properties, with AVs above $30,000 in 2023 and 2024. The new rates affect less than one in 10 owner-occupied residential properties.",4,38,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00038
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The AV is a proxy of the value of a property and is determined based on the rental transactions for comparable properties with similar attributes, such as location, age and condition. A property that earns more rental income has greater value. And therefore, the AV and the PT payable will be higher.",5,39,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00039
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The median PT for owner-occupied private residential properties in Singapore, grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 7% from 2020 to 2023. The growth rate is similar for owner-occupied private residential properties within and outside the central region.",6,40,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00040
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,I understand Members' concerns that some retirees may face financial difficulties. The Government remains committed to supporting retirees.,7,41,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00041
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"We do so not by lowering PT rates for residential properties owned by retirees, but by supporting our seniors in other ways. We have various schemes to help retirees, whether living in private residential properties or HDB flats. For example, through the Assurance Package (AP), seniors living in private properties can receive AP cash, AP MediSave and the cost-of-living special payment.",8,42,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00042

2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I mentioned some examples in my reply earlier. In addition to what I mentioned, we also provide certain assistance and certain help schemes, that are applicable to all households, regardless of housing type.",1,45,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00045
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"For example, the $300 Community Development Council (CDC) voucher that was given out in January this year, the Household Utilities Credit that was given out last year.

2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As I mentioned in my reply earlier, the property tax is a form of wealth tax on immovable assets.

Can MOF share, does Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) have a system to calibrate annual property values as a ratio of all owner- and tenant-occupied properties, to ensure that AVs are not disproportionately skewed by a few high rental units?",1,50,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00050
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, AV is determined based on the rental transactions for comparable properties with similar attributes, such as location, age and condition. The way that IRAS goes about computing AV is that they will, generally, exclude very high and outlier rentals that the properties may fetch.

2023-03-03-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, may I ask the Senior Minister of State whether we can relook the definition of wealth tax? For some of these retirees, they do not see themselves as wealthy. I know they have got a property that may be worth quite a bit, but they are retirees, no income. They just have the luck of buying a property at a lower price when they were much younger.",1,53,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00053
2023-03-03-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, how do we want, as a matter of principle, to deal with this group of people who are living in a better property, but no income? Is it the principle of the Government that we would want to persuade them to sell their property, so that they would not be considered wealthy? I mean, how do we define the term ""wealth""? Because I cannot see this group of retirees as being wealthy, except for the fact that they were fortunate enough to buy a property when they were younger.",2,54,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00054
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think I had explained this in my response to Mr Yip Hon Weng earlier and also in my main reply. Property is an asset, and I hope Mr Lim agrees with me on that. An asset is part of your wealth. So, I think we do need to consider that a person's assets is a proxy measurement of the person's wealth.",1,55,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00055
2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"This does not mean, therefore, that we do not empathise with the situation that I am sure Mr Lim's residents face.

2023-03-03-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, the way to help them is not to have a lower property tax, because that is something that we need to put in place as part of our fair and progressive tax system, but to find other ways of helping them. I mentioned some examples earlier, in AP, and also when we look at certain schemes that we design. In our polyclinics, for example, we do not means test based on your property type, but when you go to a polyclinic, we look at your age, and seniors do receive additional subsidies.",3,57,2023-03-03-T-003-S-00057

2023-03-03-T-004,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you, Sir. I thank Senior Minister of State Tan for the answer. Sir, my Keat Hong resident, an elderly couple came to see me during a Meet-the-People Sessions. Their 31-year-old intellectually disabled son was tricked to sign up for different telco lines and mobile phone contracts.",1,66,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00066
2023-03-03-T-004,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Within the span of one week, he signed up for four lines and various phone contracts. The scammers made off with the phones, the family saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of bills, but thanks to IMDA's swift intervention, I thank the colleagues at IMDA, they intervened and the bills were waived.",2,67,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00067
2023-03-03-T-004,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My question is given the vulnerability of individuals, like elderly or intellectually disabled adults, can MCI work with telcos to train or raise awareness amongst the frontline staff to have a checklist of red flags when it comes to contracting, perhaps similar to tellers at frontline banks, so that we can prevent our vulnerable individuals and adults and elderly residents from falling prey to such scams.",3,68,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00068
2023-03-03-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. It is always particularly heart-wrenching and upsetting when you hear about crimes and scams targeting the more vulnerable in our population – the elderly or people with disabilities. For that particular case, I am glad that the case was quickly dealt with by the IMDA colleagues and the telcos, and I thank Mr Zhulkarnain, the Member, for commending the IMDA team on that.",1,69,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00069
2023-03-03-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"In fact, for this case, when the IMDA team knew about the appeal from Mr Zhulkarnain, they immediately contacted the telco staff and within a couple of days, the telcos agreed to waive the charges or freeze the charges and we got back to the family very soon. Because we know the anxieties and the concerns of the parents, the family members and the individual himself.",2,70,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00070
2023-03-03-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"As I understand it, a Police report has been made over the case, and Police investigations are ongoing.",3,71,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00071
2023-03-03-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"But the broader point that Mr Zhulkarnain has raised is something that we are continually looking into. We will work together with our telcos, especially their frontline staff, to review their practices and whether additional staff training may be needed, so that they can flag out some of these possible scams and tactics being used against the vulnerable members of our community and see what ways we can improve the telcos themselves. This is in their interest. They are, also in a way, a victim of this crime, defrauded by some of these scams.",4,72,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00072
2023-03-03-T-004,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"So, it is in our collective interest to not just minimise the risk of scams and such tactics against vulnerable members of the community, but to collectively take action to prevent such cases from happening. I thank the Member for his suggestion. It is something that we continue to review.",5,73,2023-03-03-T-004-S-00073
2023-03-03-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Education (a) what surveys or research are currently undertaken to assess the job impact of training courses that are supported by Government funds; (b) whether the Government will publish the findings of such studies; and (c) whether the Government will consider extending funding support to trainers based on the outcome of the studies.,1,74,2023-03-03-T-005-S-00074

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),My response will focus on three broad themes  recovery; growth and sustainability; and our social compact.,3,94,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00094
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Our air and land transport sectors have recovered strongly from the debilitating impact of the pandemic. Let me start with aviation, about which Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Ms Ng Ling Ling have enquired. At its lowest point in 2020, Changi's passenger traffic was less than 0.5% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Today, Changi's passenger traffic volumes, flights and city links stand at about 80% of pre-COVID-19 levels. To Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query, flights at Seletar have fully recovered since January this year.",4,95,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00095
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Based on the current trajectory, Changi should return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024, possibly earlier.",5,96,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00096
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"One determinant, as Ms Ng Ling Ling noted, would be how quickly air connectivity with China is restored. Weekly services to China have more than doubled since January, from 38 to nearly 100. That is about a quarter of the number we had in 2019, with Chinese and Singapore carriers expected to resume even more services in the coming months.",6,97,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00097
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),Ms Poh Li San asked about our aviation hub's challenges amidst the recovery. Let me highlight three.,7,98,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00098
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"First, our aviation stakeholders must continue to ramp up their workforce to sustain the recovery. Today, the sector's workforce is at about 90% of pre-COVID-19 levels and we expect a full recovery by this year. But beyond recruitment, we must ensure that the new hires gain the requisite experience to meet the demands of the job and also to ensure their safety, welfare and morale, as Ms Ng Ling Ling has highlighted.",8,99,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00099
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Second, though Singapore is in now in DORSCON Green, we must remain alert to new threats from the virus and other similar threats. We are therefore closely monitoring the situation with MOH and must be prepared to respond quickly should the public health risk assessment change. This is the new normal for aviation.",9,100,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00100
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Third, the recovery of air travel will have to contend with uncertainties in the global economy and rising energy and manpower costs. Against this backdrop, Ms Poh had asked if there was room for airport charges to be raised. Last September, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Changi Airport Group (CAG) announced increases to the airport charges for passengers and airlines. We will review these charges periodically so that CAAS and CAG can continue to invest in capacity building and essential infrastructure, while ensuring Changi remains competitive.",10,101,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00101
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Turning to land transport, our public transport ridership reached 90% of pre-COVID-19 levels in January this year. However, this recovery has been uneven. Public transport journeys to the Downtown Core in the morning peak are at about 70%; whereas journeys to other areas like Queenstown are at 90% and Woodlands and Tuas are already back to pre-COVID-19 levels. We are tracking these travel patterns, which have yet to stabilise because of various adjustments to work practices.",11,102,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00102
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Our maritime hub was resilient and performed well through the pandemic. In 2022, we achieved our second highest container throughput of 37.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) and remained the world's largest transshipment hub. More recently, due to global economic headwinds, international container trade and container freight rates have softened from the exceptionally high levels of 2021, but the mid- to long-term outlook remains positive.",12,103,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00103

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Attracting talent to the aviation and maritime sectors is a key thrust as highlighted by Mr Melvin Yong and Ms Janet Ang. We are collaborating with our partners to do so through student outreach and work-study programmes, mid-career conversions and skills upgrading for workers. We will also provide career guidance and employability support through touchpoints such as the OneAviation Careers Hub portal. Senior Minister of State Chee will elaborate on our plans for the maritime sector.",23,114,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00114
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Thirdly, Mr Chairman, sustainability is central to the growth of our transport sectors. Hence, we have partnered the industry to develop sustainability pathways all three domains. Last year, I highlighted our plans to drive electrification in the land transport sector. We made good progress in 2022 with Electric Vehicles (EVs) accounting for 11.8% of new car registrations last year, up from 3.8% in 2021. So, more than threefold increase. Of all EVs registered in 2022, 20% were from Category A (Cat A), 50% from Cat B and 30% from Cat C.",24,115,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00115

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"First, we have established clear regulatory milestones. We have announced that diesel cars and taxis cannot be registered for use from 2025, nor Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars and taxis from 2030.",26,117,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00117
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Second, we have financial incentives to encourage the adoption of EVs. Ms Sylvia Lim asked why EVs incur an Additional Flat Component. As the then-Minister for Finance explained in Budget 2020, fuel excise duties are significant contributors to Government revenue, yielding around $1 billion annually. The Additional Flat Component for EVs, of $700 a year, was introduced to partly account for this loss in fuel excise duties. By way of comparison, a typical ICE car user, will pay about $1,000 a year of fuel excise duties, assuming they use the 92 or 95 octane petrol.",27,118,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00118
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Separately, the total cost of ownership for EVs has been reduced through Government initiatives such as the EV Early Adoption Incentive and the reduction in road tax for mass-market EVs, our adjustments in power-rating. We will continue to review road tax as part of the overall vehicular tax structure, taking into account the transition to electric as well as other cleaner energy vehicles and technological developments, while staying true to our objectives of controlling private vehicle ownership and usage.",28,119,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00119
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Thirdly, we have brought forward the island-wide deployment of EV chargers to address range anxiety.

Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the electrification of our public buses. This month, LTA will launch a tender for about 400 electric buses, to replace diesel buses reaching end of life from December 2024. New bus depots will be completed in tandem to support e-bus operations. This will help achieve the goal of electrifying half our bus fleet by 2030 and a 100% cleaner-energy bus fleet by 2040.",30,121,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00121
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Several Members asked about the cost impact of switching to e-buses. We are in the early stages of electrifying our bus fleet. But based on the experience of the e-bus fleet trial, the higher upfront costs are expected to be offset by lower-operating costs in the long run. I should also add that, as announced at the launch of GreenGov.SG in July 2021, from this year, all new cars procured by the public sector will be electric, or alternatives with zero tailpipe emissions.",31,122,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00122

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Let me first outline our ambition for Changi Airport. Currently, close to 20% of around 2,500 airside vehicles at Changi Airport are electric. We want all vehicles on the airside to run on cleaner energy by 2040. This would include electrification or the use of biofuels. To drive this transition, we will embark on three initiatives.",33,124,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00124
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"First, all new airside light vehicles, such as cars, vans and minibuses, must be electric from 2025, as they already have viable electric alternatives, which can progressively replace existing diesel models. We will also require certain new heavy vehicles like forklifts and tractors, for which viable electric models are available, to be electric from 2025.",34,125,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00125

As a major international aviation and maritime hub, we actively support the efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce emissions from international transport. We are also working with like-minded country partners to create sustainable international aviation and maritime ecosystems through ""green lanes"" for flights powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) as well as green and digital shipping corridors.",40,131,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00131
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Ms Ng Ling Ling asked how we will encourage the aviation hub to step up its sustainability efforts. The Government will establish a $50 million Aviation Sustainability Programme to support feasibility trials and research studies and bring stakeholders together to create innovative solutions for a more sustainable air hub. CAAS will be releasing more details, and I encourage companies to make full use of the funding. More broadly, CAAS is studying the recommendations of the International Advisory Panel (IAP) on Sustainable Air Hub and will publish the Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint in the second half of this year.",41,132,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00132

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),Let me first address the questions from Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Saktiandi Supaat about motorcycle Certificates of Entitlement (COEs). Our COE system aims to efficiently allocate our limited vehicle quota. Prices inevitably increase when demand is high relative to supply.,43,134,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00134
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"The cost of Category D COEs and its impact on motorcycle users is an issue that has been raised by Members from all sides of the House. Besides Mr Saktiandi and the Leader of the Opposition, Ms Mariam Jaafar asked a Parliamentary Question (PQ) earlier this week. Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Abdul Samad did so at the end of last year, and indeed many other Members have raised this point.",44,135,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00135
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"And we fully understand the concern especially for those who rely on their motorcycles for their livelihoods. This is why motorcycle owners receive preferential treatment under the current vehicle ownership regime. The Additional Registration Fee, Road Tax and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) charges for motorcycles are all lower compared to other vehicle types.",45,136,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00136
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"And in March last year, we took additional measures to curb any speculative bidding by dealers for motorcycle COEs. We halved the temporary COE (TCOE) validity period from six to three months and increased the bid deposit from $200 to $800. More broadly, to reduce volatility in the COE cycle for all categories, we also smoothened the supply by basing the quota on the rolling average of the de-registrations from the preceding four quarters instead of just one quarter.",46,137,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00137
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Following the changes in March last year, the TCOE utilisation rates have remained high, close to 100%, in the ensuing months which reflects strong underlying demand. It is noteworthy that in the last two months, about 450 TCOEs, secured when Category D prices were close to or above $13,000, have been forfeited along with the deposits. However, the market subsequently corrected itself with prices easing and utilisation rates going up again. And this indicates that the system is working as intended with corrections where the market cannot support the levels of prices.",47,138,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00138
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"The forfeited 450 TCOEs will be reinjected into the May to July quarter's Cat D supply. This would constitute an additional 15% above the projected supply from de- registrations. I trust that motorcycle buyers and dealers will take this into account when making their decisions to bid or buy. And we will monitor the market closely and will make further moves if warranted, including a further reduction in the TCOE validity period or a further increase in the bid deposit, as Mr Saktiandi and Mr Singh have suggested.",48,139,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00139
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Mr Singh also suggested reviewing motorcycle financing, specifically in-house financing. Such financing agreements are not new. They are a part of industry practice providing a service for prospective buyers. The Hire-Purchase Act provides for regulations governing such agreements. Our agencies will take action if there is evidence of practices that contravene these regulations.",49,140,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00140

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Ms Poh Li San asked about the cost of running public transport. Over the last decade, operating costs for public transport increased by about 7% per year on average. This was not matched by revenue growth. As Members would be aware, fares have gone up by an average of about 1% a year over the last decade. Hence, Government subsidises public transport operating costs by more than $2 billion annually and that is about slightly more than $1 per journey.",51,142,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00142
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"While we aspire to have a high-quality, world-class public transport system, we must also ensure financial sustainability, and this is the shared responsibility of Government, operators and commuters. Where we land on the balance between quality, affordability and financial sustainability is driven by what we value as a society. We believe that commuters and taxpayers must share the financial burden equitably, because ultimately, we do not want a financially unsustainable system with a large fiscal burden for future generations of Singaporeans to bear.",52,143,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00143

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),Another strong sentiment that emerged from our engagements was that inclusiveness should be at the heart of our social compact.,54,145,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00145
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"And we agree fully. First, we can be more inclusive in our road design. Hitherto, much of the focus in road planning has been to meet the needs of vehicular flows. However, our local streets are also an integral part of our daily lives and the pedestrian network in our communities. We use them to visit neighbourhood centres, markets, polyclinics and schools. It is where we might meet our neighbours and friends. And there was a strong feeling amongst the dialogue participants that we should make our streets more conducive for such everyday pedestrian use, especially with an ageing population.",55,146,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00146
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"LTA will therefore pilot an initiative to design such streets with local communities. They will be called ""Friendly Streets"", which I think aptly captures the intent of this effort. Senior Minister of State Khor will elaborate on this.",56,147,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00147

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"And third, in addition to pedestrians, we will also place greater emphasis on the needs of those who use active modes of transport such as cycling. They can expect more intra-town paths that will aid first- and last-mile connectivity to the major transportation nodes and key amenities. For longer commutes, we are exploring cycling trunk routes to connect cyclists to more places. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng will give more details.",58,149,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00149

2023-03-03-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Mr Faisal Manap asked about bus services in Kaki Bukit. On bus services 137 and 137A, LTA introduced service 137A in 2019 to provide more trips during the morning peak. This reduced the headway from 15 minutes, which is within Bus Contracting Model standards, to a maximum of 10 minutes during the morning peak. Some of the headways are within five minutes. Commuters can also use the MyTransport app to estimate bus arrival timings and further reduce their waiting times at the bus stop.",2,154,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00154

However, on a few days in January 2023, the operator reduced two trips for Service 137A due to manpower shortages and this resulted in the higher loading levels which Mr Faisal described.",3,155,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00155
2023-03-03-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"These trips have been restored, and the situation has improved.

2023-03-03-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"The second issue was on ""Townlink feeder services"". This was the previous name used before the Bus Contracting Model was introduced in 2016. We now refer to such arrangements as ""intra-town feeder services"", where feeder services would travel around the town usually in two loops from the bus interchange. There are trade-offs to run such services, which is why they are no longer introduced for new routes.",5,157,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00157
2023-03-03-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"First, these services often ply a much longer route, compared to a conventional hub-and-spoke model with shorter feeder services connecting different parts of the town to key transport nodes. The bus timings are, therefore, subject to more variability along the journey, which may lead to reduced reliability and longer waiting times for commuters.",6,158,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00158
2023-03-03-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"About 10% of commuters use intra-town feeder services to travel to another part of the town. The large majority of commuters use them to connect to the MRT and other bus services at key transport nodes. This means, that their commuting needs will be better served with a hub-and-spoke model instead of using intra-town feeder services. The hub-and-spoke model is also more flexible in meeting new demand, for example when a new Built-To-Order (BTO) estate is constructed within the town.",7,159,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00159

This message has been expanded to the entire bus and train network across all PTOs, and commuters who need these stickers or cards may request for them at bus interchanges and MRT stations. We encourage commuters to exercise graciousness and give up their seats, and not just priority seats, to fellow commuters who need them more and will put up posters at prominent locations as visual reminders. From April 2023 onwards, we will expand the Helping Hand scheme by adding more messages to assist the special needs of other commuters.

2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Chairman. Minister, my cut to MOT this year is a follow-up to my colleague, Mr Faisal Manap's Adjournment Motion of October 2021 on motorcycle ownership and his other Parliamentary Questions (PQs) on high motorcycle COEs.",1,321,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00321
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I note the Minister's point about finance as a service offered by many motorcycle dealerships and I recognise the role that it plays. However, the prospect of speculative bidding of motorcycle COEs has always been a concern of the public. I will not go through the newspaper articles that can substantiate this concern.",2,322,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00322
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Minister said that the violations of motorcycle financing would be subject to the Hire Purchase Act. But the Hire Purchase Act comes under the purview of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). In view of high motorcycles COE prices, does MOT, for example, monitor the number of repossessed motorcycles and would it consider doing so to have a better fix on the impact of motorcycle financing through dealerships today?",3,323,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00323
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, would the Ministry consider a broader study into alternative financing options for our motorcycle riders, such as through cooperatives, that could bargain for not just better block-financing rates from financial institutions, but also reduce the arbitrage component of some loans that are in turn offered by some motorcycle finance companies today?",4,324,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00324
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My second clarification is very short. It pertains to the second point of my cut. Does the Minister have a perspective on the total number of motorcycle COEs transferred to the Open Category over the last 10 years? I use 10 years because it is the lifespan of a COE, even though I note that the practice had been stopped in 2017.",5,325,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00325
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Would the Ministry consider an increase in motorcycle COEs to make up for the COEs transferred to the Open Category in the past?,6,326,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00326
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Chairman, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his questions. Actually, these two questions, straddle the gamut of almost all the issues; so, they are deceptive in their apparent simplicity. But let me endeavour to respond.",1,327,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00327
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Perhaps, I will start with the second point on COEs and allocation. I think what the Leader of the Opposition is driving at is whether there is a way to re-allocate some of the old COEs. I think that was the point he made earlier because of the old system, which was discontinued in 2017.",2,328,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00328
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, let me say and I want to reiterate this point. I omitted to mention Mr Fasial Manap's Adjournment Motion, but as I said, I do not think any one party here has a monopoly on the care and concern for motorcycle owners. We all do. We are all endeavouring to help. And the question is, how to best achieve that.",3,329,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00329
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, let me make the point that we need to be clear about what is the overall intent and structure of the system. So, I start with the vehicle growth rate. We have taken an important albeit difficult decision that the vehicle growth rate will be zero. We have done this because of the overall interest in terms of the liveability of our city and ensuring that even our roads, the flows, the vehicular flows can be sustained, going forward, taking into account road development and all the other modes of transportation that we are developing.",4,330,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00330
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, that is the first and important consideration, baseline point, that vehicle growth rate is zero. Why is that important? It is important because the moment we agree on that and – I am assuming the Leader of the Opposition agrees with that as a principle. Because if you do, then any mechanism to re-allocate COEs is basically a zero-sum exercise. We have to take it from some other category in order to give it to a more critical category. The Leader of the Opposition's proposal is to take it from, I think, Cat E, or – I cannot remember where.",5,331,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00331
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But there have been similar arguments made for other categories – whether it is for Cat A, whether it is for Cat C, commercial – in this House. So, how do we decide then where to take it from, where to allocate it, how much to allocate and how do you measure that the outcome has been successful? Because, clearly, the intent here is that – and I am reading into the Member's comment – unless prices soften, the desired objective has not been served.",6,332,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00332
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,But we have to look at any change we make to the COE system holistically for all the reasons I have just highlighted.,7,333,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00333
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, to propose one particular dimension for modification without looking at the systemic implications, I think would be remiss on our part.",8,334,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00334
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But as I have said, having said that, we have been prepared to take measures. We have, not just in terms of the systemic measures to help motorcycle owners in terms of costs, but also some of the more recent measures to curb any potential speculative behaviour on the part of motorcycle dealers. And we remain ready to do more.",9,335,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00335
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As I have pointed out, the most recent couple of months has been quite telling because there have been 450 TCOEs that have been forfeited. Which means at a certain point, there was pushback in the market and now the dealers have to let them go. And this re-enters the supply. And, as I said, I hope buyers and dealers will take note of this when making their decisions on bidding and buying for Cat D.",10,336,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00336
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The first point that he raised was on the financing elements. First, we should all be very focused on our core mission. And the mission in LTA and for MOT is to make sure that we have agreed on a policy for managing the population of vehicles and we have an allocation mechanism through the COE, and we should ensure that that is working to the best of our ability.",11,337,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00337
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, financing is essential because most buyers of vehicles, generally, do need financing assistance. Whether we can study further, whether there are any other alternatives, I would say that this is actually better left to the market and to industry players to respond. Because in the end, LTA or the Government is not in a unique position in any way or even in a position where we have special insights into this. The practices – and the Member himself has highlighted, there is a cooperative and so on – the mechanisms exist, in other context perhaps. And it is really best left to the market.",12,338,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00338
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What we will do, however, is even though the Hire Purchase Act is under MTI, if there are issues about practices that contravene the regulations, these are areas that we will want to make sure they are investigated thoroughly, because they do affect the effective functioning of the COE market.",13,339,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00339

2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"On the point of how do you re-allocate, I recognise the difficulty in doing so, particularly in the context of a zero vehicle growth policy. But I think the other context to consider, and I make this appeal to the Minister, is the landscape with regard to what has happened since 2017 and today, insofar as a burgeoning of the gig economy and the need for lower-income Singaporeans to have an affordable mode of transportation to deliver food and whatever else, has changed.",2,342,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00342
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, that was the context in which I raised the argument that covered a previous policy of LTA, which was to take COEs from the motorcycle Cat D and put it to the Open Category. And I was wondering whether there could be some considerations because of the landscape, to see whether it is feasible to consider a transfer back. And in my cut, I use the word ""equity and fairness"". It is not meant to dilute the Minister's response of the larger task of re-allocation from other categories as well. I take that point.",3,343,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00343
2023-03-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"On the point of the market, indeed, ultimately, that is the bedrock that has to sustain financing. But in view of the Forward Singapore exercise, I think there was an exercise which looked at the prospect of cooperatives partnering businesses to better manage finance. I am wondering whether the Ministry could nudge our cooperatives to consider providing loans for lower-income Singaporeans so as to ensure that the arbitrage that motorcycle financers gain is not overly large, to the detriment of lower-income Singaporeans who need these bikes in the first place.",4,344,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00344
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Chairman, on the point on re-allocation, some data points are useful. Over the last 10 years, the population of motorcycles in Singapore has been around 130,000 to 140,000. So, it has been at about that level. It has not been so volatile.",1,345,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00345
2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And when we talk about allocation to Cat E, it is not just from Cat D. And we continue to have allocation from Cat A, Cat B and Cat C into Cat E, which then gets recycled.",2,346,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00346

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What I am trying to illustrate is, I do not think we have a disagreement in terms of wanting to help. But we have to be very clear that in our desire to do so, we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Because it is a system that in general has worked. But let us also be clear  why we are discussing this today is because the prices have gone up. When the prices were lower, we were not debating these issues in the same way.",4,348,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00348

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The second point is, the point has been made, by the way, on ""equity and fairness"", and I think ""equity and fairness"" depends on where you stand and whom you are advocating for.

2023-03-03-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the possibility – so, now, it is beyond MTI; it has gone to the cooperatives and whether we can ask them. I will dutifully convey the message. But I just want to come back to what I said at the start, which is that, in the end, there are various market mechanisms. We should encourage it, I fully agree with that. As the Leader of the Opposition said, if there is an arbitrage possibility and if the market is functioning well, then somebody would take advantage of the arbitrage and come in – whether it is a cooperative or another finance business or whatever.

On one side is a very densely populated residential area but on the opposite side, is the industrial area. In the consultation with LTA, I have been informed that because the density is not high enough to justify this, it will be considered.

2023-03-03-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My first question is with regard to the Friendly Streets, which I actually laud, and I am happy to hear that Friendly Streets will be launched, including in Toa Payoh as well. My first question with regard to Friendly Streets is that when you co-create, does it involve the option of having covered linkways? The reason why I asked is because some areas are beyond MRT stations. Will the covered linkways be part of the suite of options that can be chosen by the committee?",2,378,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00378
2023-03-03-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question is with regard to the question in my cut on the Ministry's plans to roll out affordable EV motorcycles as part of the sustainability efforts in our land transport system. I would like to ask the Minister whether these affordable EV motorcycles—hopefully, we will move away from ICE motorcycles to EV motorcycles over the next decade or so, but it has an impact on the demand that Member Pritam Singh has mentioned just now. What does it mean for Singapore and can we have an assessment of the possible early adoption incentives for EV motorcycles? For Singaporeans who want to get EV motorcycles, will there be incentives?",3,379,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00379
2023-03-03-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My ""half"" question is with regard to electric buses. The Minister mentioned 400 new electric buses and electrification. I have met residents who mentioned that they really want to have electric buses because they are quieter, they are less noisy, especially for those staying near on the second, third floors of HDB blocks facing bus stops. Can it be sped up even faster – half of the buses by 2030, possibly, all by 2030, if it is possible?",4,380,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00380

This is already quite a bit of an acceleration over the last one to two years because we decided we have to move. What I think I would say is, let us get this first tender out, let us run in the system a bit more, because what we have had up to now are pilots and trials. We now need to do this at scale and understand the implications because when you ramp up and it goes up to half or more of your fleet, the implications are quite different from running a small-scale pilot.",5,388,2023-03-03-T-007-S-00388

I also see many cruising on e-bikes without having a pedal at all, which is not consistent with LTA requirements that the motor power can only cut in when the cyclists start to pedal.

2023-03-03-T-008,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Because of how retirement adequacy in Singapore is tied so much to employment, caregivers who give up their most productive earning years because of care needs in their families are exposed to old age poverty and this cannot be right.",3,505,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00505
2023-03-03-T-008,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Bringing forward financial support mitigates the stress faced by caregivers over finances, anxiety towards their own ageing, which contribute to long-term chronic health conditions like hypertension and diabetes, among others. These will in turn exacerbate the healthcare cost burden down the road, which will only get worse as our population ages.

2023-03-03-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Chairman, Healthier SG is essential to support ageing in place. It focuses on preventive care and goes upstream to reduce hospitalisation rates. To achieve widespread participation and success, there are four critical areas that needs to be addressed.",1,520,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00520
2023-03-03-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, working with general practitioners (GPs) is a vital component of Healthier SG. However, some GPs are concerned about the proposed Drug Whitelist and the price caps for each drug in the Whitelist. Following these price caps could result in significant earnings loss for them. There is also no guarantee on earnings from Healthier SG payouts, as the number of new patient enrollees and complete cooperation from patients are not guaranteed. Ultimately, managing a private practice is a business venture. As such, if GPs believe that joining Healthier SG would result in a loss in earnings, they would hesitate to participate. In the end, residents lose out because they have fewer GPs to choose from. In fact, some of them would not even have a choice, because the GP that is nearest or most convenient for them, is not part of the programme. How will the MOH address these concerns in time for the roll-out in July this year?",2,521,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00521
2023-03-03-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, what can seniors expect when Healthier SG is launched? Many seniors have shared with me that they are concerned about what this means for their medical expenses.",3,522,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00522
2023-03-03-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Third, there are also some concerns about social prescription, which is a major component of Healthier SG. Some community exercises led by HPB have closed down and have not resumed, even as we resume normalcy post-COVID. Are there plans to bring them back? Can the quantity and variety of Healthier SG activities be increased? Who is curating these activities? Are our healthcare clusters involved in the curation? Can ground-up activities be part of Healthier SG? If so, can we link them up with ActiveSG, while ensuring that there is no conflict and keeping the overlap of resources minimal?",4,523,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00523
2023-03-03-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Furthermore, with the increasing popularity of home-based medical care services, would these be under Healthier SG? What are the Ministry's efforts in regulating this sector? Are there steps being taken to ensure the safety and quality of such services for patients who require them? Are there plans to allow the use of MediSave for home care services provided by approved providers? This could help alleviate the financial burden on patients who require such services and encourage the use of home-based care, where appropriate.",5,524,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00524

2023-03-03-T-008,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Lastly, End-Of-Life or EOL and palliative care should be incorporated into Healthier SG. We should ride on the GP mantra ""cradle to grave."" Families that have a trusted GP that they have seen for years, will be relieved to continue receiving care with them. As part of this effort, can our GPs promote Advanced Care Planning or ACP, as part of Healthier SG? We should encourage Singaporeans to tap on the MyLegacy portal for EOL planning. This is a good opportunity to involve the wider community such as lawyers, grassroots, financial planners and religious leaders.",7,526,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00526

MOH will need to work with various ministries and agencies to map out the needs of our people, determine the optimal network design of such Assisted Living services in both public and private estates so as to minimise the service provision cost, fund the infrastructure building and co-fund the service provision, help our seniors free up their assets to pay for their share of these services and to work with the private and people sector to spur the creation of a spectrum of services that will meet differing needs and budgets.",2,529,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00529

2023-03-03-T-008,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Sir, many young children and young adults are vaping in the public places. Health Sciences Authority or HSA dealt with 2,477 cases of vaping in 2019. The number increased by three times to 7,593 in 2021.",1,708,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00708
2023-03-03-T-008,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Over the past three years, an average of about seven out of 1,000 students from a public school were caught for smoking and vaping offences. But vaping appears to be growing in popularity with young people. There are reports of primary school pupils getting caught as well.",2,709,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00709
2023-03-03-T-008,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Some people think that vaping is healthier than smoking. This is not true. A Johns Hopkins report suggests that vaping is not safe, may be bad for the heart and lungs and may be just as addictive as cigarettes. The fun, fruity ""flavours"" of these e-vaporisers adds to the misconception that vapes are harmless. I am worried that a new generation is getting hooked on nicotine.",3,710,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00710
2023-03-03-T-008,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Thus, I would like to suggest HSA consider working with other agencies to educate youths and general public that vaping is not harmless and that vaping is illegal. I also hope HSA could work with schools and other law enforcement agencies to double the enforcement efforts.",4,711,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00711
2023-03-03-T-008,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Lastly, I understand the purchase, usage or ownership of an electronic vape may result in fines of up to $2,000 per offence. Is this a sufficient deterrence? I suggest MOH consider doubling the fine quantum and consider a jail sentence for repeat offenders.",5,712,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00712
2023-03-03-T-008,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, HPB's plans to expand the capacity of its physical activity programmes in the community by 50% as part of Healthier SG is heartening.",1,713,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00713
2023-03-03-T-008,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"However, with the move to online and mobile enrollment into these programmes, can the Ministry share how it plans to ensure continued, easy access to these programmes for seniors who may not be digitally-savvy. Also, how does the Ministry plan to ensure that these programmes remain well-distributed across various locations so that residents in every neighbourhood continue to have easy access to this physical activity programmes?",2,714,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00714

2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Thank you, Mr Chairman, let me start by answering a couple of COVID-19 related questions posed by Dr Tan Wu Meng. He asked about excess deaths.",1,716,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00716
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I reported in the House late last year that as at end-June 2022, our age standardised death rate throughout the pandemic was 549.9, per 100,000 person years. This is higher than the base rate which we used in 2019, which is 525 per 100,000 person years. So, there is some excess death.",2,717,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00717
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As at end December 2022, the number has gone up further and slightly to 555.7. This is expected as we are taking in the mortality of all major infection waves throughout the pandemic. This indicates an excess death rate of 30.7 per 100,000 person years. Nevertheless, due to the concerted effort of Singaporeans, we remain one of the countries with the lowest mortality rate and excess death rate in the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.",3,718,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00718
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Dr Tan also asked about strengthening our vaccine capability. This is something we are actively looking at, both in terms of building up our research and development (R&D) capabilities and also anchoring local manufacturing capabilities here. I will give a fuller update at a subsequent Sitting, because we are going to table our full after-action review in the House. This will take place not too long after the COS debate.",4,719,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00719
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"A major after-effect of COVID-19 pandemic is that it inspired us to accelerate the changes to our healthcare system. As a result, the healthcare system is now at a very decisive stage of a major transformation, working off a foundation that took many, many years to build. And now, we look at healthcare system not as one system but as three interlinked systems.",5,720,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00720
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, the acute care system, which is mature, well-developed. This is a system comprising hospitals, specialist clinics, treating the sick. Second, the population health system. I would say this is a teenager or adolescent. We are putting more emphasis on this through preventive care, through Healthier SG. And third, the aged care system. This one is a baby, still developing. We need aged care to take place predominantly in the community and not nursing homes.",6,721,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00721
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The imperative for this transformation is our rapidly ageing population, which I think is the biggest social development for this generation.",7,722,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00722
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The impetus to act now is COVID-19, which made things that were hitherto impossible now possible. In crisis, we made it possible. So, do not waste a crisis. Most importantly, through the crisis, the crisis brought to the forefront the power of preventive care, like good hygiene, screening tests and vaccinations.",8,723,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00723

2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, we need the right size and quality of manpower. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu will be speaking on this. But let me make a few comments first. We need, based on our projections, to increase the number of nurses and support care staff by about 40% – from 49,000 now, to 69,000 in 2030.",11,726,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00726
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I have explained in the House before, that with a rising population of seniors who will fall sick more often and the shrinking population of new local entrants into the workforce, the numbers simply do not add up. We will not have enough local healthcare workers to support our healthcare needs.",12,727,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00727
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We have to do first whatever we can to develop our local pipeline of talent, including some of the suggestions Mr Gerald Giam put forward – attract retired nurses to return; serve as locums; increase male participation, that will be most welcome. But we still need to complement it with foreign healthcare workers, from varied sources.",13,728,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00728
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Various Members raised the issue about welfare of workers. I thank you for this. But fundamentally, the best safeguard for their welfare is to have sufficient manpower. No sufficient manpower and you have people who are so responsible, they are going to burn their weekends, they are going to burn their rest days and so on. You have to simply beef up the manpower resources. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu will speak more about it.",14,729,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00729
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As for foreign healthcare workers who become valuable members of our team and demonstrate commitment to Singapore, we should be prepared to integrate them into our society, just as we do for many foreign professionals.",15,730,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00730
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"At the same time, and a few Members have raised this, society needs to appreciate and respect healthcare workers. The great majority of our patients and their loved ones and their family members, do. This is hugely motivating for our healthcare workers. But abuse and harassment by a small minority is a rising issue in our healthcare institutions. This is not acceptable. We will need to take a firmer stand against this.",16,731,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00731
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We need, as Mr Ang Wei Neng suggested, a consistent understanding across the healthcare system on what constitutes abuse of healthcare workers. We need to then empower hospitals to take a firmer stand against such abuse. When hospitals take such firm stand against abuse, the hospitals must feel confident that their management, MOH, the Minister and hopefully, this House and the public, will stand behind in protecting our healthcare workers against abuse. MOH has convened a workgroup to study this issue. They have completed their work. We will be sharing the findings on MOH's plans later this month.",17,732,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00732
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Second undergirding issue is we need the right IT systems and tools, to allow patients' key health data to be collected and shared across health providers safely and securely to ensure seamless and integrated care. Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will elaborate on this.",18,733,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00733
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, we also need to improve the support system and safety net for vulnerable groups, especially to the lower-income families. Minister Masagos will elaborate on this.",19,734,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00734
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me move on to talk about the three healthcare systems. Let me start with the one we are most familiar with and briefly, the acute care system.",20,735,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00735
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We have about 11,000 public hospital beds today and we intend to add 1,900 more public hospital beds over the next five years. This will mainly come from Woodlands Health Campus which we are waiting eagerly for, and this will progressively start operations from end of this year. Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub will also start operations this year. Preparation works for the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital and the new Eastern Integrated Health Campus are also in progress.",21,736,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00736
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"While not part of the acute care system, polyclinics are a very important part of our healthcare ecosystem. The Sembawang Polyclinic will start operations in the second half of this year and so too the Tampines North Polyclinic. Another eight will come on stream by 2030.",22,737,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00737
2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We need to have adequate hospital capacity.

2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We want each of our residents to enrol with a family doctor, to build a long-term patient-doctor relationship.

2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"It is voluntary for GPs to be a Healthier SG clinic. We have about 1,600 GP clinics in Singapore focused on primary care. Our assessment is that the great majority appreciates the objective of Healthier SG. They think it is a move that should have come earlier and they want to be part of it. But the sums have to work for them and we are working with them closely. We hope to secure the great majority of them to be our partners in Healthier SG eventually.",30,745,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00745

I also announced that we will launch a pre-enrolment exercise in May 2023. This is an early bird exercise. Who does it apply to? Those aged 40 and above, already have chronic illnesses and regularly visit their GPs. But their GPs need to sign up for Healthier SG. If they have not signed up, please try to persuade your GPs to sign up.

Just with their CHAS subsidies, they pay $0 or very little for their visits and medications. However, there are patients with complex chronic diseases who need several drugs and medication.

2023-03-03-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I should emphasise that this Healthier SG CHAS Chronic Tier is an option for this group of patients. It is an option because we know that some of these patients in this group are used to certain brands of drugs and they prefer to get it their GPs even though the drugs are not subsidised.

The role that fathers play in early childhood development may not be well-known, but it is no less important.

2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Mr Chairman, Sir, as our healthcare system evolves, services such as home care and teleconsultations are becoming more commonplace. These changes drove our move towards a premises-neutral and services-based regulatory regime. However, sharing of information remains limited. Patients need to remember and repeat their medical history and there is an administrative burden on providers to avoid unnecessary investigations or tests.",1,902,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00902
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Some programmes are attempting to close this gap, like the Primary Tech-Enhanced Care-Hypertension (PTEC-HT) Programme in polyclinics mentioned last year. This allows patients to submit their blood pressure data to their primary care team who views these readings through a dashboard. A patient can change polyclinics and the new polyclinic can continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure through the dashboard. The patient need not record and repeat their blood pressure readings from the original polyclinic. These are small steps in the right direction and we need to build on these steps.",2,903,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00903
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"It is critical that healthcare providers can collect, access and share standardised health information across settings to facilitate the provision of uninterrupted and holistic care. For example, we screen women at risk of gestational diabetes during pregnancy. We know that early detection and intervention for such women can improve both maternal and infant health outcomes.",3,904,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00904
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"With Healthier SG and data sharing, general practitioners (GPs) can identify women with pre-diabetes and support them on lifestyle changes to prevent the onset of diabetes. When the woman becomes pregnant, data sharing will enable her health information to be accessed by her obstetrician, who will then know about her higher risk to develop gestational diabetes. If she does develop the condition during pregnancy, she will have a higher risk of developing diabetes within the five next years after delivery. So, her regular GP will need to know about what happened during the pregnancy and so work with her on preventive measures to keep diabetes at bay. Data sharing enables care and preventive care provision to take place seamlessly as she goes through different stages of her life and this data sharing needs to happen from the community practitioners to the hospital specialists, and back again.",4,905,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00905
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"I agree with Dr Lim Wee Kiak that data sharing is needed to enhance patient care and on the need to expand the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR), as with Ms Mariam Jaafar on building our capabilities to harness the power of digital tools. The NEHR was designed to facilitate data sharing for care coordination and give healthcare providers greater visibility of the patient's medical history. This will enable practitioners to make better care decisions for their patients.",5,906,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00906
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"We haveintegrated the HealthHub application within the NEHR. In addition to viewing health information such as drug allergies and medications, patients and their authorised caregivers can also manage their medical appointments via the HealthHub app. With Healthy365, patients can check their health points, track their physical activities and diet as well as access community activities. We intend to progressively make available more health information from the NEHR on the HealthHub app.",6,907,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00907
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"To support these initiatives and many others, we will require our licensed healthcare providers and allow selected entities to contribute data to the NEHR. GPs participating in Healthier SG will be required to contribute to the NEHR within one year from the launch. We are also exploring how to better facilitate the sharing of health and administrative data between these partners.",7,908,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00908
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The sharing of data also enables public agencies such as the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to formulate national programmes, initiate new preventive healthcare programmes or reach out to residents who may be socially isolated and require support. For example, through its Preventive Health Visits with seniors, AIC's Silver Generation Office (SGO) shares relevant information it gathers with Active Ageing Centres and the Regional Health Systems so that they can follow up with relevant programmes for their residents.",8,909,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00909

2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"There are three things the legislation will seek to achieve. First, to enable the collection of patients' selected health data from healthcare providers. Second, to allow healthcare providers to share health and administrative data with one another for specific purposes. And three – and third, I beg your pardon, to govern the collection, use and disclosure of such data by setting out robust cyber security and data security requirements.",10,911,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00911
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Given the sensitive nature of health information and the consequences of misuse, stringent requirements must be placed on the collection, use and sharing of health information. There are measures already in place under the Personal Data Protection Act and the Cybersecurity Act, and these requirements already apply to our healthcare providers today.",11,912,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00912
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"However, we will do more.

2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Health information is personal and it is something that Singaporeans expect to be carefully and sensitively handled. Thus, beyond engaging the PDPC and CSA, we have been extensively consulting stakeholders on issues surrounding data privacy and sharing. These include our licensees, healthcare professionals, IT vendors, members of the public, patients and caregivers.",13,914,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00914
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The views gathered are helping us shape the Bill to address our policy intent, the needs of patients and the administrative and operational costs for providers. The consultations continue and we will address the feedback. We subsequently intend to table the Bill in this House in the later part of this year.",14,915,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00915

Although cancer patients account for about 2% of all patients, cancer drugs make up 35% of public sector drug spending. Over the five-year period from 2017 to 2021, this spending increased by over 90% while overall national age-adjusted cancer mortality improved by 2.1%.",20,921,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00921

Since its announcement in 2021, the CDL has helped MOH secure an average price reduction of 30% on the listed drugs. Expensive and novel treatments may not equate to better outcomes and we strongly encourage patients and practitioners to choose the listed drugs where possible.",21,922,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00922

A minority of patients are on non-CDL treatments and they may need time to adjust to the changes. Multiple support measures are being provided to help them continue with their current treatment course with minimal impact to their out-of-pocket expenses. These include financial support for existing patients in our public institutions and the preservation of Integrated Shield Plans coverage until 30 September this year. Thereafter, non-CDL treatments may remain covered by private insurance products such as IP riders. If affordability is an issue in private healthcare institutions, patients can opt for subsidised care at the public healthcare institutions where they may apply for additional support such as MediFund.",22,923,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00923

These measures will be ported over to the Healthcare Services (Amendment) Bill which will be debated in the House later this month. This allows unlicensed providers to be subject to the same penalties as licensed providers if they contravene the regulations on healthcare advertising under the Healthcare Services Act. We take a serious view of this and will not hesitate to take errant providers to task. Members of the public are encouraged to remain wary of exaggerated claims when consuming healthcare services from unlicensed providers.,25,926,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00926

The framework will spell out the training needs of the practitioners and, through this, mental health training courses can be aligned towards a common set of training standards as described by the framework.",56,957,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00957
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The framework will apply to practitioners involved in supporting individuals with mental health needs, ranging from lay responders, such as peer supporters, to mental health professionals, including nurses, social workers and counsellors, amongst others. Practitioners can benefit by receiving more consistent and evidence-based instruction and training. This uplifts mental health care capabilities for all providers, which will result in higher quality care and improved outcomes for clients.",57,958,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00958
2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Finally, to complement these efforts, there needs to be a proper understanding and perception of mental health issues as well as a willingness to seek help when needed. That is why HPB launched the ""It's OKAY to Reach Out"" campaign to emphasise that help-seeking is appropriate and to encourage individuals to seek help for their mental health needs.",58,959,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00959

2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"We often say that healthcare workers are the backbone or the lifeblood of the healthcare sector. These medical metaphors are correct because if the healthcare system were a body, none of it would function without healthcare workers. It is, therefore, important that we continue to recruit healthcare workers from diverse sources and ensure that the sector remains an attractive one.",2,970,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00970

2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"We have increased local intakes of students over time to ensure a stable supply of healthcare professionals. This increase will materialise in the workforce in the coming years. For example, the first batch of 230 allied health graduates from the Singapore Institute of Technology entered the workforce in 2020. After increasing the intake by around 85%, about 430 students from the 2022 batch will enter the workforce in 2026.",4,972,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00972

We want to attract students from all pathways into suitable healthcare programmes. Take for example the Diploma in Nursing offered by polytechnics. Besides ""N"" Level, ""O"" Level and ""A"" Level pathways, students can also join from the Integrated and International Baccalaureate Programmes, whether at the fourth or sixth year of study. The other nursing schools like ITE and NUS also offer multiple admission pathways.",5,973,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00973

2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Healthcare staff are also encouraged to continue upgrading their skills and practise at the top of their licence.

By expanding and advancing their skillset, they can look forward to a long and fulfilling career in healthcare.",7,975,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00975
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"However, the most important and urgent step we need to take is to beef up nursing manpower. In recent years, the global competition for healthcare workers has intensified, especially for nurses. The attrition rate for local nurses has remained stable over 2019 to 2022, but, for foreign nurses, this has spiked from 9.5% to 14.5% over the same period. The loss of both local and foreign nurses to our competitor countries is a key reason for the stress and high workload for our nurses. We need to replace the manpower lost to other countries, safeguard the welfare of nurses and meet increasing needs.",8,976,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00976
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Therefore, as Ms Mariam Jaafar has rightly pointed out, the most critical and practical thing to do is to increase manpower. To this end, we are ramping up recruitment of foreign nurses. We will go through a period of increased inflow of foreign nurses because of their higher attrition in recent years.",9,977,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00977
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Looking forward, we will continue to need foreign nurses to complement our local core. Because if our population has more and more seniors and fewer young graduates joining the workforce, the numbers will not add up and local nurses alone cannot meet our healthcare needs.",10,978,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00978

2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"After recruiting them, it is equally important that we retain the healthcare workers we have. To answer Mr Gerald Giam's question, we review salaries regularly to ensure that healthcare workers are paid competitively. Last year, we announced an enhanced special payment package for nurses in both the public and community care sectors. Among the public healthcare institutions, they will also refresh and update pay components, such as allowances for shifts and for work duties beyond regular hours.",14,982,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00982
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"As Dr Tan Wu Meng has pointed out, other measures, such as flexible work arrangements can help retain staff who might leave otherwise. For those who leave the sector, our healthcare institutions maintain contact to encourage them to return. Every year, over the past five years, about 750 non-practising nurses return to practice, joining some 2,400 new nurses. In comparison, about 1,300 nurses do not renew their practicing certificates each year. We will continue with our efforts to retain the nursing workforce.",15,983,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00983

I thank several Members and Nominated Members who have spoken up on this, such as Mr Abdul Samad, Dr Tan Yia Swam, Ms Ng Ling Ling and Mr Louis Ng. Those who have worked in a healthcare institution will know that many of our healthcare workers work beyond their call of duty, skip meals and forego rest time. Their strong sense of duty keeps them going, but it is neither sustainable nor fair that they constantly sacrifice their well-being. In a profession where people come first, there must be more we can do to ensure their welfare.",16,984,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00984
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"We work closely with public healthcare clusters on this. In recent years, the public healthcare clusters have appointed Chief Wellness Officers to develop system changes to improve staff well-being and also support measures like counselling and peer support networks. The clusters also regularly survey staff on whether they feel able to cope with the demands at work and whether they know how to seek help when faced with stress or workplace bullying.",17,985,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00985
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"To ensure healthcare workers have enough rest between and during shifts, the clusters regularly review administrative processes and remove them if not needed. We are also reviewing the working hours of junior doctors, but it is a complex issue that will take time to work out. At present, the hospitals use methods like electronic logging and surveys to monitor junior doctors' working hours and well-being.",18,986,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00986
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"That said, hospitals are operational environments which have to address patient needs on a day-to-day basis. When planning rosters, hospitals take into account the skill mix of staff on each shift and each staff's preferred shift pattern. Healthcare workers have also covered for each other occasionally where there is an operational need.",19,987,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00987
2023-03-03-T-008,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"In addition, Singaporeans can show their support by lightening the load on healthcare workers. Each of us can avoid bogging nurses down with administrative and basic tasks that do not require nursing expertise to address. We seek the public's understanding on this. Family members can do their part in assisting their loved ones in the hospitals with basic care, such as feeding and moving around. It is also reassuring for patients to be attended to by their loved ones. Your support in such activities will allow nurses to focus on complex care tasks, such as medication administration and wound care. We are grateful to those who already do their best to support healthcare workers.",20,988,2023-03-03-T-008-S-00988

This includes enhancing protection for healthcare workers by improving and standardising how public healthcare institutions deal with abuse and harassment.

To engage the Indian community, we promoted healthy eating messages during Deepavali, such as the need to reduce sugar consumption in desserts. The public may have seen last year's Deepavali music video with Mediacorp's Vasantham. HPB also held exercise sessions and health screening in places of worship, such as the Central Sikh Temple.

One example is a new initiative by the MCO Workgroup, called Saham Kesihatan (Healthy Investment), which was piloted at M3@Towns at Tampines and Jurong.

Gems is a social enterprise that organises activities for women to lead healthy lifestyles. Since joining Gems almost 10 years ago, Mdm Haslina has participated in activities such as Spartan Races, sea expeditions and dragon boating. She also earned her rock-climbing certification. This is a woman at the peak of her physical prowess, and you might assume I am describing someone in her 20s. In fact, Madam Haslina is a grandmother of five.

HSA monitors and targets the illicit sales of e-vaporisers on social media and messaging platforms to curb online access. HSA and the National Environment Agency (NEA) are working together on a cross-enforcement pilot for NEA's enforcement officers to also act against vaping offences.

2023-03-03-T-008,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"On Dr Tan's second question of how to recognise the misleading claims, I think this is an area where there is quite a lot of education that is needed. It is going to have to require ongoing efforts around public education because medical treatment does change. I think the key issue is that if the provider is licensed, they are required only to assert claims that are provable and demonstrable. So, I think the first thing is to establish whether this is a licensed medical provider.",1,1021,2023-03-03-T-008-S-01021

The pace of ageing is fast. In the community, we can see in a matter of months, how some of our residents become frail.

2023-03-03-T-009,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),The Government also strives to provide subsidies in a way to achieve welfare without eroding the work ethic.

I have also suggested for MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to be extended to school-going children who have such parentage for the same reasons of elevating the financial burdens of such households where a Singapore Citizen has a child or stepchild who is a PR resulting from a transnational marriage.",7,1219,2023-03-03-T-009-S-01219

2023-03-03-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"My concern is while the broad efforts go some way to advance the interests of PwDs as a community, we may miss out specific issues that may only affect a particular group. For example, even within persons with intellectual disabilities (PwIDs), there are different levels of abilities. So, when we talk about lifelong learning and preparing them to live independently, could there be a finer resolution that could maximise the potential of each group?",8,1258,2023-03-03-T-009-S-01258
2023-03-03-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I am not expecting the Government to do everything or for things to be done immediately. There needs to be a whole-of-society effort and involvement, a point which I will touch on later, but I believe it would be meaningful for a framework that dives into specifics for different groups, assessing how successful some measures are, addressing what the challenges are and continually developing the infrastructure of support for PwDs and their families.",9,1259,2023-03-03-T-009-S-01259
2023-03-03-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, I would like to know if there could be more streamlining of some services and support for both PwDs and their family members. Akin to the approach in our child and maternal health and well-being efforts, could we also look at streamlining some services that would make it easier for families to manage the care of PwDs?",10,1260,2023-03-03-T-009-S-01260
2023-03-03-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I had spoken about Dr Chen Shiling in my previous speeches. Dr Chen had developed a holistic healthcare approach for ageing caregivers and their adult children with intellectual disability, addressing also social issues and bringing together multidisciplinary stakeholders on the same platform.

In 2019, PAP.SG then under the leadership of you, Chairman, I put up a submission to the Government with proposals on various aspects of ageing. In one segment of the paper, it was noted that society should provide better support to caregivers including those from the extended family members.

The Community Silver Trust (CST), for instance, allows for donation matching for only 40% of funds raised, to pay for ""recurrent operating expenses"". The remaining 60% can only be matched if there are ""new projects"". The current CST design shapes charities to do some funny things, to keep thinking of new projects each year to qualify for the matching, when there are ongoing existing programmes that need to be paid for, such as for the disabled and elderly.

But for infant care teachers, I am quite sure many of us are experiencing that there is a long waitlist. There, certainly, is a long waitlist at the preschool centres in my constituency. Therefore, my first clarification is, what can we do to increase the supply of infant care teachers, so that it will help to shorten the queues for them?",2,1601,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01601
2023-03-03-T-011,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"My second clarification is to the Minister. We are heartened by the top-up of $300 million into the ComCare Endowment Fund. We know that the cost of living has gone up. My simple question is, on the review of both ComCare and Public Assistance scheme, when is this due, because for all those who are receiving these, the last year, in particular, has been quite hard on them.",3,1602,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01602
2023-03-03-T-011,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"And my third clarification is for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. I refer to a suggestion by Mr Leon Perera where he suggested that we could dispense for SSOs to probably dispense or simplify the need to verify certain documents. My own take is that we need to be cautious about this. I would rather say and hope that, instead, SSOs be empowered more to exercise greater flexibility to work within the guidelines and yet, exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis as they evaluate each of these ComCare applicants.",4,1603,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01603
2023-03-03-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his clarifications. We all recognise that, indeed, we do have a shortage of manpower in the early childhood industry. Currently, our manpower stands at 24,000 persons. As I have mentioned in my main speech, we would need an additional 2,500 persons to join the early childhood sector by 2025. The Member is right that it is in the areas of infant care educators, infant care carers, that we do face an acute shortage.",1,1604,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01604
2023-03-03-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, ECDA has embarked on a three-pronged approach. I have mentioned reviewing of their working conditions, ensuring competitive salaries and also ensuring that they have good skills development and that there is career progression for them.",2,1605,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01605
2023-03-03-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Over and above these three areas, ECDA is also working with AOPs and other preschool operators to step up recruitment through online means as well as through job fairs. We are also working with AOPs, where possible, for them to consider diverting their manpower internally so that there is good deployment between infant care and childcare where they are operating in the same premises.",3,1606,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01606
2023-03-03-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Over and above that, as I have mentioned in my main speech, we are working with the AOPs to actively reach out to both local and foreign sources of manpower. We definitely hope that we can encourage more people to consider joining the early childhood education industry.",4,1607,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01607
2023-03-03-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I have mentioned that we are tapping on community networks and these community networks are very wide. It will include PA, Daughters Of Tomorrow and also ""Women at Work"" by MENDAKI. So, through these combined efforts, we hope to be able to encourage more to join the early childhood education industry.",5,1608,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01608
2023-03-03-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you, Chairman. The ComCare Short and Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) and the Long-Term Assistance (LTA) were just reviewed in August 2022. So, we raised that from $600 to $640, and have higher cash assistance for the LTA. But we must continue to monitor this current increase in inflation, which is not the usual one, creeping slowly, but given the circumstances that are faced by people all over the world. We will look at this and, if the need arises, we will certainly increase the support to our ComCare recipients.",1,1609,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01609
2023-03-03-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, the income eligibility, we will provide an update at the end of the year. But having said that, the income eligibility criteria are not hard thresholds because the SSOs can assess holistically the family, their needs, because if their basic needs cannot be met, no matter what their income is presented to be, the SSOs do have the discretion to support them. Therefore, we do have flexibility to exercise on a case-by-case basis.",2,1610,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01610

2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Chairman, I thank the Member for his suggestion and his comment. I agree and I just want to go on to add – and also to add to Minister Masagos' point – about the fact that the SSO GMs and staff do have some discretion, especially when giving out quick and immediate support. Oftentimes, we get feedback that SSO applications take about four to six weeks to get approved. That is for a large percentage of all cases that come in. But beyond that, the GMs do have some discretionary funds within each SSO for them to take some quick actions as well. I just wanted to add on to that.",1,1612,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01612

2023-03-03-T-011,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I appreciate the points made by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. Just one supplementary question. That is in relation to the suggestions I made about significantly enhancing the ComCare grant quantums in line with minimum income standard research, extending the runway perhaps to a year and making the application process less onerous in terms of interviewing family members and documents and so on.",1,1614,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01614
2023-03-03-T-011,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My clarification would be  would the Ministry be open to experimentation, doing a pilot to see if we do these things and make significant changes, whether the net benefits will outweigh the risk or the downside in terms of reducing that bandwidth tax, reducing the stress, enabling that trampoline effect where families are able to plan ahead and plan a turnaround in their life? And also, just improving the outcomes of their children as they go through this life that they have to go through, which they did not choose to go through.",2,1615,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01615
2023-03-03-T-011,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Would the Ministry be open to that? I think Assoc Prof Jamus Lim made some similar suggestions as well. So, the role of experimentation and pilots.",3,1616,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01616
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Chair, I thank the Member for his additional suggestions. I think there were a couple of things that were said; well, quite a number of things were said.",1,1617,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01617
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"I think, first of all, it is the reference to the minimum income study. I think that has been covered in the last COS and addressed by Minister Masagos. I will not go into great detail on that. I think our position on that has been clear; there have been previous press releases by the Ministry of Finance as well with regard to that study.",2,1618,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01618
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"To two other points that the Member made regarding the application process. I think the Member also was nodding away when I was talking about SupportGoWhere and ComCare applications being made easy through SupportGoWhere. That is just the start of our entire journey. We are on the cusp of change in the social service delivery landscape, if I could put it that way. And I think ComCare being on SupportGoWhere is just one of the starting points for us in revolutionising the delivery of social services.",3,1619,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01619
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"So, that is one part of things about the ease of application for social service applications.",4,1620,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01620
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"The last point on experimentation, I think the Member would be very seized to find that part of ComLink is exactly about that – for us to have an area carved out that we can do policy sandboxes.",5,1621,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01621
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"For instance, the point about the 60 Jalan Besar families taking on this upstream approach. Of course, this is more operational than policy that they have one point of contact for all the different services, have the befriender and the ComLink engagement officer working together to make sure that what is presented in terms of an action plan to each family is coherent, it is not obfuscating to the family, it is not confusing to the family.",6,1622,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01622
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"That is only the start of what we are looking at. But essentially, a part of ComLink's DNA is about daring to do new things policy-wise as well. I think some of these moves would be gradually revealed as some of the details are being worked out. I urge the Member to watch the space for announcements related to ComLink.",7,1623,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01623

2023-03-03-T-011,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"Thank you. I would like to direct my question to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. I think to commend MSF for taking on this very bold experiment. I feel like ComLink is almost undertaking a massive endeavour that is similar to what social service agencies might do. So, my question is, does the ComLink programme have headcounts within MSF that play a dedicated volunteer management role? Yes, that is my question. Depending on the answer, I might ask further.",1,1625,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01625

2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,I am fully aware of that. I thank the Member for her question. I think the short answer is there is never enough manpower.,1,1627,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01627
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"But the longer answer is that behind each befriender, we are not leaving the befriender to do his or her job alone.",2,1628,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01628
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"In my speech, I said the befriender will put things together almost like a character from Mission Impossible, harnessing things in the coherent plan for the family, having great knowledge of the different schemes and programmes, both on the Government's side of the house and the community's side of the house, and present a coherent plan to the family. He or she is supported by a ComLink engagement officer, the CEO. Yes. Who is a staff of the SSO.",3,1629,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01629

2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"As I mentioned in my speech, today, we have more than 700 befrienders. There is a certain type that we look for in a befriender. And Ms Carrie Tan, being in this sector for a long time, would know that we want those who are big-hearted, red-blooded and have a big heart for ComLink families to be able to journey with them for the long haul. Because we are not talking about volunteering for ad hoc occasions, we are talking about going at it for months and sometimes, perhaps, even for a couple of years, at least, with each family, understanding them in depth and then proposing and perhaps, nudging and working through with these families – as equals, of course – on the situations that they are in.",5,1631,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01631
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"So, I feel that the bar for befrienders is also high. If anything else, I would really make a clarion call for more to step up to be befrienders. And I thank the Member for highlighting this issue on manpower as well.",6,1632,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01632

The second question is, what kind of jobs are the additional 100 over places that you mentioned would be added this year? Thirdly, how else can the business sector help so that persons with disability have a higher chance to stay engaged?",2,1635,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01635
2023-03-03-T-011,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Chair, I thank the Member for her clarification. I think she would agree with me that the sheltered workshops' environment is very much suitable and amenable to persons with intellectual disability, not so much for persons with autism. The additional 100 spaces that we are talking about would be the type of jobs that we typically can find in a sheltered workshop.",1,1636,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01636

So, we are trying to future-proof or move the sheltered workshop model into a more advanced stage.",2,1637,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01637

2023-03-03-T-011,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"I have no doubt that the befrienders are currently supported by very technically sound and competent MSF officers. But I think it kind of misses the point, because volunteer management requires someone with a very wide variety of skill sets, including being a cheerleader, a peer support facilitator for the volunteers, strong in communications so that they can continuously share uplifting stories, help to boost their morale, listen to them, sometimes, be an Agony Aunt, because befrienders themselves could be impacted by the stories that they see.",2,1642,2023-03-03-T-011-S-01642
