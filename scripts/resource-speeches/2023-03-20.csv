Our healthcare and frontline workers had been at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19.

2023-03-20-T-002,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Prime Minister given the new normal of endemic COVID-19 and shifts in global inflation dynamics (a) whether Singapore’s long-term inflation expectations are well anchored; (b) whether there is the risk of de-anchoring of inflation returning to our long-term target in a timely manner under current challenging global macroeconomic and supply conditions; and (c) whether there is also a risk that our current estimates of long-term inflation have risen.,1,8,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00008
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","Mr Speaker, Sir, available measures indicate that Singapore’s longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. The five-year ahead inflation forecasts of economists and professional forecasters have been broadly unchanged over the past two years. While households’ longer-term inflation expectations picked up in late-2021 to early-2022 alongside the rise in global and domestic inflation, the latest survey from December showed that expectations have fallen to close to their historical levels.",1,9,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00009
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","The stabilisation of households’ longer-term inflation expectations occurred alongside a similar outturn in actual inflation in late 2022. Year-on-year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Core Inflation remained unchanged at 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter, after rising continuously since the first quarter of 2021. On a month-on-month basis, the pace of increase in core prices has trended down over the second half of 2022.",2,10,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00010
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","MAS, like other central banks, will continue to focus on stabilising near-term inflation and price expectations, as these weigh heavily in the formation of longer-term inflation expectations.",3,11,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00011
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","As the Member observed, multiple factors will influence the path of global, regional, and domestic inflation over the longer term. These include, for instance, demographics, technological advances that impact productivity, future trends in globalisation and central banks’ commitments to ensure low and stable inflation in their economies. These factors can potentially boost or dampen inflation. There is therefore uncertainty and a significant diversity of views among central bankers, academics and analysts on the likely inflation trends in the long term.",4,12,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00012
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","I would like to reassure Members that MAS is closely monitoring and assessing these developments, and is unwavering in its objective of securing price stability for sustainable growth.",5,13,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00013
2023-03-20-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Saktiandi.,1,14,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00014
2023-03-20-T-002,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister of State for his answer to my question. I have two supplementary questions. My first is in regard to the assessment of the long-term inflation by MAS and the Government. How often would MAS or the Government assess the long-term inflation estimates, taking into consideration the changes in dynamics in commodity prices, global shifts and inflation dynamics?",1,15,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00015
2023-03-20-T-002,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question is related to what has happened overnight and things that have happened in the financial sector globally. How does financial stability play a part in our exchange rate policy considerations and also long-term inflation? If the Minister of State can also briefly share about the latest developments on financial stability, given overnight happenings, what impact do those have on inflation and Singapore's financial sector as well?",2,16,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00016
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The longer-term inflation expectations are proxied by five-year ahead forecasts for inflation, both looking at professional forecasters as well as household expectations. The household expectations survey, the DBS-SKBI SInDEx (Singapore Index of Inflation Expectations) Survey, as I mentioned, has shown that five-year ahead inflation forecasts have stabilised over the June and September surveys, and fell in the latest survey in December. So, it is a mixture of both professional forecasters as well as household expectations.",1,17,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00017
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the Member's second supplementary question, I will frame the context in terms of how that would be impacted by or affecting longer-term inflation. As Members know, MAS' monetary policy is medium-term focused to achieve low and stable inflation as the basis for Singapore's economic growth. MAS has tightened monetary policy since October 2021 and will continue to closely monitor global and domestic economic developments in the run-up to the scheduled policy review in April 2023, where it will take into account the implications for inflation as well as growth.",2,18,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00018
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"By themselves, near-term shocks such as the recent developments in the international banking industry would not have direct implications for the long-term path of inflation and the Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER). As I mentioned in my earlier response, these depend on longer-term structural factors such as demographics, technology advances that impact productivity as well as future trends in globalisation.",3,19,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00019
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"But as the Member also observed, there have been developments overnight and earlier this morning, and I would like to point Members to the statement that MAS had issued this morning and other statements related to developments in the international banking sector on 16 March 2023 as well as 13 March 2023.",4,20,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00020
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Allow me to make a few quick points. First, Credit Suisse Group AG will continue operating in Singapore with no interruptions or restrictions following the announced takeover by UBS Group AG or UBS. Customers of Credit Suisse will continue to have full access to their accounts and Credit Suisse's contracts with counterparties remain in force.",5,21,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00021
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,The takeover is not expected to have an impact on the stability of Singapore's banking system.,6,22,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00022
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Second, Singapore's banking system remains sound and resilient. The Singapore dollar money market and foreign exchange market continue to function well. The Singapore banking system has insignificant exposures to the failed banks in the US and Singapore banks have confirmed that exposure to Credit Suisse is insignificant. Banks in Singapore are well-capitalised and conduct regular stress tests against credit and other risks. Their liquidity positions are healthy, underpinned by a stable and diversified funding base.",7,23,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00023
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,MAS will continue to closely monitor the domestic financial system and international developments and stands ready to provide the liquidity through its suite of facilities to ensure that Singapore's financial system remains stable and financial markets continue to function in an orderly manner.,8,24,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00024
2023-03-20-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.,1,25,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00025
2023-03-20-T-002,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Just a quick follow-up on the question about inflation expectations. I wonder if the Minister of State can elaborate on whether MAS has observed any evidence of inflation pressures actually passing through to wages, in particular? And if so, what kind of mitigation mechanisms does the MAS have in terms of dealing with the possibility that this could become more entrenched?",1,26,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00026
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. As MAS has also communicated, MAS Core Inflation is expected to ease more discernibly over the second half of 2023. This reflects a combination of base effects and also moderating external and domestic labour cost pressures. What does this entail? It actually suggests that longer-term inflation expectations are unlikely to persistently increase. Of course, we are looking at this and monitoring this very closely.",1,27,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00027
2023-03-20-T-002,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"But more broadly, wages in Singapore are not tightly indexed to inflation. Over the years, our tripartite wage-setting institutions have ensured that wage outcomes remain in line with productivity growth. For these reasons, we assess that the risk of a wage-price spiral remains contained at this point. But we will closely monitor developments as they go.",2,28,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00028
2023-03-20-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong Mun Wai, next question.",1,29,2023-03-20-T-002-S-00029
2023-03-20-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs why Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Ms Lim Suet Fern are named and disclosed while being investigated for giving false evidence in judicial proceedings when the names of the six former management staff of Keppel Offshore & Marine Limited were not publicly disclosed while they were being investigated.,1,30,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00030
2023-03-20-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, this question, I have originally directed —",1,31,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00031

2023-03-20-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,But I can talk more about the context of the question.,1,33,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00033

2023-03-20-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"If there is a Parliamentary Question (PQ), it will be posed. As a response, if you have a supplementary question, you can pose after that.",1,36,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00036

2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will also deal with the question that has been asked by Mr Leon Perera, which is scheduled for a subsequent Sitting, on the same topic.",1,39,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00039

2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The general approach is that law enforcement agencies do not disclose the names of individuals who have been, or are being investigated.",1,41,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00041
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,This general principle is subject to exceptions.,2,42,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00042
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"One example when names have been disclosed is where the offender has absconded or left the jurisdiction while investigations are ongoing. For example, Members may recall the case relating to Pi Jiapeng and Pansuk Siriwipa. The couple was involved in a series of alleged cheating cases involving luxury goods. They fled Singapore last year, in 2022, while investigations were ongoing. The Police released their details.",3,43,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00043
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A second example would be where the facts which constitute the alleged offences and the individuals who may have committed the alleged offences, are already publicly known – for example, as a result of findings made by our Courts, and there is some public interest in disclosing that investigations are underway. Such disclosure has to be weighed against possible prejudice to the individuals concerned.",4,44,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00044
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A case in point would be where, following the judgment of the High Court in Parti Liyani’s case in 2020, the Police commenced investigations against her employer’s son, Karl Liew, based on the High Court’s observations that he had given dishonest evidence under oath. I informed this House of those investigations during the debates relating to the case.",5,45,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00045
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"However, this does not mean that Police will automatically publish the names of the individuals under investigations, if their names had been made public in other, earlier proceedings. The context in which the names had been published in other proceedings, the nature of those proceedings, the nature of the offences being investigated and the connection of the offences under investigations to the original proceedings and whether the agencies have taken the view that subsequent criminal proceedings are or are not possible – all of these are relevant.",6,46,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00046
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"An assessment of all the facts and the context has to be made, in considering the public interest, as to whether to disclose the names.",7,47,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00047
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Yet another type of example, where names have been published, is the case of Chew Eng Han. He had been convicted of several offences. He was then arrested when attempting to flee Singapore. Police made public the arrest on the day he and his accomplices were arrested, and their identities were released. After investigations, Chew and one accomplice were charged.",8,48,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00048
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A fourth example relates to Alex Yeung. Alex Yeung stated publicly that his passport had been impounded, in respect of some conduct. Police then issued a media statement explaining that Yeung was assisting the Police but had not been arrested.",9,49,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00049
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,A fifth example would be where Police are investigating a case and there is a lot of misinformation. Police might then make public the accurate facts relating to the case to dispel the falsehoods – and we have done that in the past.,10,50,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00050
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As can be seen, there are a wide variety of situations where it may become necessary to make public the fact that a person is under investigation, has been arrested or is assisting in investigations. We have to assess the facts and the public interest involved.",11,51,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00051
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The circumstances relating to Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern straddle the first two examples that I have mentioned.,12,52,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00052
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The discussions surrounding No 38 Oxley Road are of significant public interest.

Police investigations were commenced, based on the findings of the DT and the Court of Three Judges. Police did not make public at that time in October 2021, that the couple was being investigated.",31,71,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00071
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A question was asked in this House earlier this month, about some public statements which had been made relating to Oxley and the judgments of the DT and the Court of Three Judges. Members can look up the Question and Answer. The Question required discussing the accuracy of those public statements in the context of the judgments of the DT and the Court of Three Judges, and it required dealing with the honesty or otherwise of Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern.",32,72,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00072
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That there were ongoing Police investigations, arising from the findings of the DT and the Court of Three Judges, was in that context relevant and necessary to be disclosed, to give an accurate and full Answer. It was also accurate to give a complete answer to mention that Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern had not cooperated with the Police investigations after saying that they would.",33,73,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00073
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The reasons for disclosing that Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern were under investigation, are broadly similar to the reasons why it was disclosed that Mr Karl Liew was being investigated for perjury. Except that in the case of Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern, they have, in addition, absconded from jurisdiction. In Mr Karl Liew’s case, we were discussing his conduct and the conduct of other family members and the Court’s findings in this House. We thought it necessary to disclose in that context that Mr Karl Liew was being investigated. He cooperated with the investigation; he has since been charged.",34,74,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00074
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Some Members may also recall – that I had said in this House when we were discussing the Parti Liyani case, that if any judgment or decision issued in the course of any legal proceedings contains findings, that there may have been perjury or other serious offences, that is something that we will take seriously. We mean what we say. I do not recall any Member expressing a different view, that such lying on oath in Court proceedings should not be taken seriously.",35,75,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00075
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That was the situation with Mr Karl Liew, and that is the situation with Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern. But as I said, with the added fact that they have also absconded.",36,76,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00076
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To summarise, the DT and the Court of Three Judges had said Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern were lying. They had been found to be dishonest and more. All of that is public. They have also essentially absconded from jurisdiction. We take this seriously. And those facts were disclosed so that this House can have a full and complete picture, when a question had been asked which related to their conduct. If we cannot or should not answer the question in part or full, then, we would also have said so.",37,77,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00077
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In deciding whether we make public that investigations are ongoing, one factor which is considered is prejudice to the person being investigated. If the investigations show that the person is innocent or an assessment is made that his guilt cannot be established in Court, and if his name had been publicised earlier, a cloud would have hung over him until he was cleared. Thus, the general position is that names are not disclosed.",38,78,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00078
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Whether names should be released in a particular situation is a matter of judgment on what public interest requires. The examples I gave earlier illustrate the exceptions when names were made public.,39,79,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00079
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, if you take the case of Mr Karl Liew, what is the prejudice to him? In Mr Karl Liew’s case, the High Court had taken the view that he was not telling the truth. The prejudice to him in disclosing that he was under investigations for that finding of lying, is marginal if any and has to be weighed against the public interest at stake, in disclosing the facts when the matter is being discussed in Parliament.",40,80,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00080
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The same applies to Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern. Members who are not lawyers may not know this but when a DT says that a person is guilty, it can only do so if it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the guilt. Likewise for the Court of Three Judges in disciplinary proceedings. The statements in Parliament about Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern do not materially add to any cloud the couple may already be under based on what the DT and the Court of Three Judges have said.",41,81,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00081
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If the facts are different, then the position will be different. For example, say a name had been published in other proceedings and the Court had made some findings. But if our agencies are not able to prosecute the individual based on the earlier Court findings – because they assess that despite the earlier Court findings, substantial new facts have to be proven and that relevant evidence is not available and that relevant witnesses are not available, then there can be arguments both ways, on disclosure, and an assessment has to be made on the specific facts and a judgment has to be made.",42,82,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00082
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But the cases of Mr Liew, and the Lees are quite different; and as I have said in the case of the Lees, they have also absconded.",43,83,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00083
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I can tell Members that there is another case where the highest Court had made observations that a couple of persons had lied on oath. That matter is also being investigated. If there is a relevant question or issue about that matter, I can see that we will also set out the facts and say that Police are investigating. But just like with Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern initially, when investigations had first commenced, Police had not volunteered the information. But Police will respond with the facts if there is a need to – for example, if questions are raised in Parliament.",44,84,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00084
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern will have every right to provide explanations, on the matters being investigated if they eventually decide to do the right thing and cooperate with the Police. It is their choice whether they want to be fugitives from justice, or whether they come and explain why they say the Courts were wrong to say that they had lied.",45,85,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00085
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The case of Keppel Offshore & Marine Limited (KOM) is quite different. It does not fall within the different examples I have set out.,46,86,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00086
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Members may not know this, but it was KOM which had made the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) report. The CPIB had conducted as thorough an investigation as it could with the information and powers that it possessed. It turned all the stones it could – and assessed the evidence together with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC). They concluded that they could not sustain any charges in Court  the conduct had taken place overseas, key witnesses are not available, key documents are not available. We received some information from Brazil, but it was not adequate to mount any criminal charge. There were no admissions which could be relied upon to cross the evidentiary requirements. The documents between the US authorities and KOM and the DPA, also do not meet the evidentiary requirements. They go some way, but they do not cross the threshold in respect of those who were being investigated. The CPIB, for good reasons, has the reputation for being able to ferret out the truth. But even the CPIB cannot get something out or proceed with charges when there are no documents or other evidence which cross the evidential threshold, and which can be used to break down the interviewees’ defences.",47,87,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00087
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In these circumstances, the general policy of not disclosing the names of individuals who have been under investigation, applies.",48,88,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00088
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"However, if any Member feels that this general policy should be changed and that law enforcement agencies should name all individuals who are being investigated, regardless of the circumstances and even if they are not abscondees from jurisdiction, and even if no charges are likely to brought in the end, then please let me know. We can then debate that.",49,89,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00089
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I would be surprised if anyone says that.,50,90,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00090
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If everyone agrees that persons under investigations should in general not be named, then the only question is the circumstances under which nevertheless names will be disclosed.",51,91,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00091
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And I have explained some examples of when names have been disclosed. The fact that no one raised any issues with Mr Liew being named, or when names of other abscondees had been disclosed, shows that no one in this House took issue with this disclosure.",52,92,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00092

2023-03-20-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Can you keep it to two supplementary questions so that others can ask as well? I will come back to you if there is time.,1,95,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00095
2023-03-20-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,Okay. The issue here is really about fairness before the law whether we have the rule of law in Singapore or not. The Minister has shared that some of the exceptions involve the offender having absconded. May I ask the first question then – did the Police specifically issue a written order for Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Ms Lim Suet Fern to attend to the investigation at the Police station?,1,96,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00096
2023-03-20-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, he mentioned the difference between the KOM case and this case. But is the KOM case not also a matter of very wide public interest? A lot of people are very interested in the names of the six individuals. I do not understand the legal process very well but under the stern warning letter, is there a paragraph that says that these six individuals of KOM are guilty but the prosecutor decided or the CPIB decided not to pursue the case because of some other reasons.",2,97,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00097
2023-03-20-T-003,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, we have a situation here that for a KOM case – actually it is a more serious case – they are actually guilty and we have the names in the foreign jurisdiction documents already – this is one point. Second point is that the KOM case is actually of deep public interest. So, why is there a double standard?",3,98,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00098
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I took some care to explain the difference between the KOM case and the case of Mr Liew and the Lees. As I understand the Member, he says that the KOM case is a case of public interest, people are interested to know their names, so why is there a double standard?",1,99,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00099
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Did the Member listen to the explanation on the difference between the KOM case and the case of the Lees and Mr Liew? Perhaps the Member can go into a little bit of detail, based on the explanation I have given on the differences and tell us, which part of the explanation he disagrees with before he alleges double standards. Get to the facts, I have set out what the differences are. Tell me which part the Member does not understand or disagrees with.",2,100,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00100
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And on his first question, did the Police issue a written order – they were given an email, they promised that they will come and agreed to give an interview. They then left the jurisdiction and they have said both to the Police and in public that they will not cooperate with the Police. They will not even come back into the jurisdiction. That is why I said they are essentially abscondees from justice.",3,101,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00101
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But, for the record, I have made it very clear why the disclosure here is consistent with the disclosure in the Karl Liew's case.",4,102,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00102
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And Sir, through you, I would also like to ask Mr Leong, if Mr Leong did not see any problem when Mr Liew's name was mentioned in similar circumstances – in fact, he took part in the debate and wanted a commission of inquiry. Why then this extraordinary concern suddenly about the Lees that he did not show for Mr Liew? And perhaps he can explain why his approach shows double standards?",5,103,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00103

2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr Perera for that question. That is in fact the key point. In fact, one could say that that is the key point in making a decision on going public. And that is why you need to look carefully at the facts.",1,113,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00113
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, if you look at the facts relating to Mr Liew and the Lees, what has happened? The High Court has said that, in the case of Mr Liew, perhaps in less clear language; in the case of the Lees, very direct language, which I have taken you through – that at least Mr Liew as well as the two Lees were not telling the truth.",2,114,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00114
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The investigation relates back to that very point on which the Courts have taken a view as to whether they lied or did not lie. That is why I said the prejudice is very marginal, if any.",3,115,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00115

2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, these are factors in the prejudice that you should take into account.

You do not try and recover ground after that and shore up as it were.",5,117,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00117
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"You make these calculations before – what is the extent of prejudice?

So, that is an assessment and it is an assessment we have to make.",6,118,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00118
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In this case, in the case of the Lees, I have explained why I think the prejudice is pretty much non-existent because we are simply repeating what has been said and saying that the Police are investigating that matter. Which everyone would expect us to do anyway, because I have said in this House we will investigate these matters. So, what is the prejudice?",7,119,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00119
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But there may be other cases potentially where the prejudice could be a little bit more.

2023-03-20-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I think the question was posed to him by Mr Leong about whether the Police had actually issued an order to Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee to attend the interview. And his answer was that they were emailed, and they said that they would cooperate. Do I read from that that actually, the Police had not gotten to the stage when an order under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) was actually issued to them?",2,124,2023-03-20-T-003-S-00124
2023-03-20-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That is right, Sir. A specific order under the CPC was not issued. The Police normally would not issue such an order. They would first contact, then speak with and then send the written document. And if a party says that they will cooperate, the Police would assume in good faith that that is how they will proceed. That is what was done and the next thing the Police heard was another email from the couple saying that they will not cooperate.

2023-03-20-T-004,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health with regard to the 2021 National Wellness Committee on Junior Doctors that was set up during the COVID-19 period (a) whether the recommendations of the Committee have been updated to reflect the shift towards a post-COVID-19 environment; and (b) if so, how does the Ministry intend to improve the attrition rate of junior doctors.",1,140,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00140

2023-03-20-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the attrition rate of doctors in the public healthcare sector has remained stable in the last three years, ranging from 3% to 5%. Nevertheless, we continue to make efforts to improve the well-being of our doctors and to retain them in public service, including the formation of the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors (NWC-JD) which has been studying initiatives to promote and improve the well-being of junior doctors in the public healthcare system.",2,144,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00144
2023-03-20-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The committee is conducting a series of in-depth small group discussions with junior and senior doctors. Through these, we have sought to validate the approach to key concerns such as the need to improve career pathways, address work hours and improve work conditions. The committee is concluding its engagements with stakeholders and finalising its recommendations.",3,145,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00145
2023-03-20-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Early initiatives already in place include the appointment of Chief Wellness Officers in our public healthcare clusters. These officers have a responsibility to enhance the well-being of all healthcare staff. We have also begun to expand and refine career pathways, such as the introduction of the Hospital Clinician scheme to provide doctors with more diverse career options.",4,146,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00146
2023-03-20-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the worst of the pandemic is over and patient numbers have reduced. However, all our healthcare workers remain busy serving the healthcare needs of Singaporeans. The committee continues to review the working hours, working conditions and well-being of junior doctors. It will take some time to study these matters and make appropriate further recommendations.",5,147,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00147

2023-03-20-T-004,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Just one short supplementary question. Will the Ministry of Health (MOH) consider initiatives, such as reducing paperwork and streamlining some of the admin processes, to make a more conducive work environment for our junior doctors?",1,149,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00149
2023-03-20-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the committee is indeed reviewing these matters as well as the issues of night calls and duty hours. We are doing electronic logging and surveys to monitor the workload of junior doctors.",1,150,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00150
2023-03-20-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"However, the issue goes beyond just the simple redistribution of workload or the simplistic hiring of more manpower. Both may be necessary, but the changes will impact the overall optimisation of our system in our current multidisciplinary model. It is a complex subject, and this part of the review will take some time to study and work out and recommendations will be made.",2,151,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00151

2023-03-20-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. Two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. Earlier, he mentioned that the junior doctors were being consulted as part of this review, but could I ask him whether there are any junior doctors on the committee itself, the National Wellness Committee?",1,153,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00153
2023-03-20-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And the second question is some doctors who had spoken publicly earlier have mentioned two key areas to be reviewed, which are mandating rest days and also to move away from 30-hour calls. So, I would like his confirmation that these areas are being looked at with some priority.",2,154,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00154

2023-03-20-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, one quick supplementary question. Is the Government looking at the cap of 80 hours per week, I believe, that is still in place? Previously in the House, I have mentioned that there is evidence from other jurisdictions that you can get the same training outcomes with the cap of 70 hours per week, so will that be reviewed by this committee?",1,157,2023-03-20-T-004-S-00157

2023-03-20-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Dow's role is to manage the integration of the respective roles and promote the use of safe and sustainable materials. SportSG promotes the use of these materials to install sports infrastructure and set up shoes collection points at its ActiveSG sports centres.,2,167,2023-03-20-T-005-S-00167
2023-03-20-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Alba-WH is the appointed collection partner responsible for collecting shoes and delivering them to BT Sports, which manages the facility to grind the recycled shoes into granules for use as building materials.",3,168,2023-03-20-T-005-S-00168
2023-03-20-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This facility is Singapore's first grinding facility, which is able to grind recycled shoes into granules for use as building materials.

An investigation was immediately commenced by the project partners to look into these observations.",5,170,2023-03-20-T-005-S-00170
2023-03-20-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Alba-WH, as the party responsible for the collection of the shoe recycling bins, had engaged Yok Impex, another company, to do so for selected parts of Singapore. These bins were brought to and then sorted at Yok Impex's premises, before being sent to Alba-WH's warehouse for registering and weighing. They were subsequently delivered to the grinding facility.",6,171,2023-03-20-T-005-S-00171
2023-03-20-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The investigation found that the shoe recycling bins at Yok Impex's premises were not properly segregated from other sorting activities, resulting in some shoes which were meant for recycling being exported to other countries for resale. Alba-WH has since terminated the services of Yok Impex.",7,172,2023-03-20-T-005-S-00172
2023-03-20-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The project partners have also taken steps to tighten the process chain. These steps include appointing only contractors and subcontractors that are not involved in any second-hand trading of textiles or shoes. Secondly, transporting all collected shoes to Alba-WH's premises without any aggregation or sorting at an intermediary premises; and thirdly, conducting regular spot checks and inspections at contractors' and subcontractors' premises.",8,173,2023-03-20-T-005-S-00173

2023-03-20-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),I thank the Minister of MCCY Mr Edwin Tong and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey Yam Keng for their answers. I have one supplementary question for the Minister. The Minister mentioned that there will be regular checks conducted on the premises. Can I just ask how regular will these checks be?,1,191,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00191
2023-03-20-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"And I have two supplementary questions for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey. One, can the Government encourage more private sector participation to recycle items like sports shoes, like in this case, so that we can minimise the volume of shoes actually being thrown away and being incinerated or in the case of being disposed of overseas, being dumped in landfills? Number two, will the Government consider giving more incentives to companies to attract them to take part in such recycling programmes?",2,192,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00192

It is not an entity that SportSG deals with directly.",1,193,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00193
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai)","At the same time, the degree of regularity should also depend on the extent to which the number of shoes collected and aggregated at the various centres reach a certain level that makes commercial sense for the partners to then go and collect it.",2,194,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00194
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai)","So, I would say, we leave the precise engineering of the timetable to the partners to deal with, but I would like to assure Mr Tan that one of the learning points from this is precisely to also conduct these checks often and unannounced, so that there will be not just a check itself but also the whole framework and a system, to deter activities that do not comply with the contractual scope of the obligations.",3,195,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00195

Are there any contractual mechanisms that Sport Singapore can impose on its partners to similarly have such monitoring mechanisms or tightening of that process downstream on the subcontractors?",2,201,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00201
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank Mr Zhulkarnain, first of all, for his encouragement for this project to continue. And I think that is important because much as there has been an infraction at the process level, at the end of the day, this is a project that allows us to use materials that we would otherwise have really no use for. And the number of shoes that are discarded everyday amounts to a substantial number. Which is why we have been able, since the project started, to collect 10,000 kilogrammes of shoes and have already deployed them into the existing facilities that we have. We intend to continue with this – whether it is at playgrounds or other sports facilities.",1,202,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00202
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Zhulkarnain knows from our masterplan that there are plans to install sporting facilities in, as far as possible, every town that we have.

2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On Mr Zhulkarnain's point about having tighter contractual mechanisms, it is possible. So, some oversight, some checks, some unannounced, some audits, and some reports can be put in place. And all these can be put into the contract and the provisions for reporting.",3,204,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00204
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But, at the end of the day, I think it is also important to bear in mind that this is otherwise not a complicated contract nor a complicated arrangement. It is really for an aggregator to come and go around the different bins to collect the shoes. And it is really a question of taking the steps to ensure that there is proper segregation.",4,205,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00205
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"What, as we can tell from the investigation, resulted in the problems that we have seen, came from a lax system for proper accounting and not allowing them to be properly sorted in segregated sections. That was the real problem. And so, steps have been taken to correct this between Alba and its various other sub-contractors – those that it may appoint in place of Yok Impex.

This is pertaining to the Reuters report, which I think, really, was addressing the prospect of greenwashing, or at least the concerns of greenwashing.",1,211,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00211
2023-03-20-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I do not really have any objection to the principles behind why this initiative was carried out by Sport Singapore. I think sustainability initiatives ought to be encouraged. But my question pertains to whether Sport Singapore or MCCY made an assessment as to the conversion of sports shoes into rubber granules as being more green or more environmentally sustainable than the existing method which, as I understand also, uses this recycled tyres, for example. So, the question then is, does this initiative move the needle, or is it just a conversion of one recyclable material for another?",2,212,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00212
2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The short answer is yes, there was such an assessment made. And to take Mr Singh's comparison, without overly going into technical details, the rubber density of old tyres is quite different from that of the shoes that you see and the extent to which we want a certain density at the running track and on the playgrounds, they rely better and use better the materials from the shoes rather than old tyres.",1,213,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00213
2023-03-20-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My understanding from people in the industry is a lot of these materials are then actually compressed together – tyres are used with rubber soles as well. Because each layer of the surface of a running track is made of different materials. I would not get into the technicalities of it, of course, but I think the principle point remains with regard to ensuring that the method that SportSG adopts is actually more green and sustainable to ensure that programmes like this succeed.",1,214,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00214

2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But I will put to Mr Singh this – at the very least, this method does use the shoes as a further source of materials, when the shoes would otherwise be disposed of. So, if nothing else, the grinding facility provides an additional avenue for waste material.

The first is on the description of lax sorting at the downstream contractor Yok Impex. Looking at the Reuters article of 25 February 2023, I may stand corrected, but there is a phrase that says, ""none of the 11 pairs of shoes donated by Reuters were turned into exercise paths or kids' parks in Singapore”. In view of this, what is the Ministry's assessment of how lax the sorting was, given that, none of 11 shoes donated by Reuters actually went to the intended purpose?",1,218,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00218
2023-03-20-T-006,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"The second question is, do the authorities' investigations plan to look into whether any sub-contractor or their employee received inappropriate direct or secondary gains or even inappropriate gratification in conjunction with the redirection of these shoes that were meant to be recycled?",2,219,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00219

2023-03-20-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As to Dr Tan's first point, the way in which the system was working previously, was for Yok Impex, the sub-contractor, to collect from designated areas around Singapore and all of their collections would then be brought back to their facility for the sorting purposes. I cannot tell you nor can I glean from the Reuters' report where the shoes were deposited; whether they are all done at the same place or divided up into 11 different locations or otherwise. And so, I would not want to speculate as to why that is the case. The fact of the matter is that as far as the investigations show, it is only the Yok Impex collections that have been tainted with this finding based on information we have currently. So, the measures that Alba has taken in relation to Yok Impex would, in relation to the findings that we know so far, be sufficient to address the problem.",2,224,2023-03-20-T-006-S-00224

2023-03-20-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier in his answer, he mentioned that CPF Board intends to remind members who have gotten divorced to review their nomination.

2023-03-20-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, I would urge the CPF Board to relook at this phenomenon where CPF nominations are not revoked upon divorce. One of the arguments which I hope the Board will consider is that, in a divorce proceeding, CPF funds are actually liable for distribution as matrimonial assets. So, in other words, spouses who have accumulated CPF funds during the marriage, at the point of divorce, it is up for division if the court feels it fit to award a spouse part or all of the CPF funds accumulated during matrimony of the other spouse. So, in that sense, an ex-spouse would already have his or her share of the CPF funds of the spouse at the point of divorce. So, it is actually not logical that most members would want the ex-spouse to have another legacy at the point of death when that spouse has already had the division of the CPF funds at the point of divorce. So, I hope the CPF Board will look into this as well.",3,238,2023-03-20-T-007-S-00238

The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)'s Child Protective Service (CPS) investigates cases involving serious abuse or neglect of children and young persons in accordance with the statutory framework set out under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA). The threshold for CPS to exercise various powers under the Act is predicated on whether there are ""reasonable grounds to believe that a child or young person is in need of care or protection"". The fact that a child is not attending school is not, by itself, sufficient grounds to invoke CYPA powers. This is because non-attendance could be due to many other reasons.",1,252,2023-03-20-T-009-S-00252

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For instance, our infection protocols in the migrant worker dormitories were insufficient and we faced a major outbreak which almost resulted in a disaster.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),We never wavered from our commitment to take care of our migrant workers. We acted as quicky as possible and activated every resource we had available to control the situation. We have also learnt from this episode and taken steps to plug the shortcomings in our system – something that Minister Tan See Leng will share later in this debate.,43,334,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00334
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, we started out advising the public to only wear masks when unwell. We changed this later to mandate the use of masks in public spaces when we realised that asymptomatic transmission was possible. On hindsight, we should have been less definitive in our position on mask-wearing from the outset. We should have encouraged facial coverings of some sort, including homemade masks, while we ramped up the production of surgical masks. This would have given people psychological reassurance that they could do something to protect themselves and would also have helped to slow down transmission and spread of the virus, even though the improvised masks only provided partial protection.",44,335,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00335
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In some other areas, like the implementation of safe management measures (SMMs), we did the right thing. We designed measures that took into account the risk that was inherent in different settings and activities. But we allowed the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Our rules were, at times, too finely calibrated, too complicated to follow and too difficult to implement – the varying group sizes, which I am sure everyone remembers; different rules for adults and children; different sets of rules for physical activity in different settings are some examples of this.",45,336,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00336

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"One of the most difficult judgement calls we had to make was on managing our borders. Border restrictions are an important defence against the virus, but we also know that such measures only help to buy time; they cannot completely stop the virus from coming in. The question is how far do we go in tightening our borders, recognising that this will also impose a huge cost on livelihoods and on Singapore’s reliance on the world for a living.",49,340,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00340
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Reflecting on our experience, our sense is that, at the beginning, we should have built in a margin of safety and tightened border measures more aggressively the moment the virus showed signs of spreading across borders, even though there might have been some risk of us overreacting to these signals. This would have bought us time to understand the virus and build up our hospital capacity.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In particular, we took some time to resume the entry of Long-Term Pass (LTP) holders into Singapore because we had found that even with pre-departure testing, a high percentage of travellers from some countries were still testing COVID-19-positive on arrival. Our concern was that the large number of infected persons could easily overwhelm our isolation facilities and healthcare capacity.",52,343,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00343
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"It was a judgement call we had to make at that time, and not without reason. But we also know that the restrictions created significant difficulties for some groups of LTP holders, such as Employment Pass holders with families here but who were abroad, or vice versa. Some of them endured prolonged family separation and disruption to their work. Singapore did incur reputational cost and lost some goodwill from this segment of the community who also had their homes here. On reflection, we could have let the LTP Holders back in sooner, or at least prioritised entry for some groups, such as those with families here.",53,344,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00344
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We subsequently learnt from these experiences and adjusted our border responses when we dealt with the Omicron variant in late-2021. Members will remember we swiftly implemented a not-to-land policy to travellers from certain countries and we applied a combination of hotel and home quarantine for other travellers, depending on where they came from. The quick tightening of rules created a lot of inconvenience for those returning from their vacations then, because this was in December 2021. But it was necessary. And once we learnt more about Omicron and determined that it was less severe and not of significant concern, we eased the measures quickly as well. That was one example of how we learnt from the experiences with border restrictions.",54,345,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00345
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Another example came up in December last year, when China moved away from its zero COVID-19 policy. At that time, China experienced a significant surge in cases. Several countries like the US, Japan and South Korea imposed tighter restrictions on arrivals from China. But we did not do so – and the reason is because we assessed that there were no new variants of concern detected in China, and the viral strains there were already circulating around the world and in our community. Furthermore, our arrivals from China were relatively few, and only a small proportion of them had COVID-19. We were therefore confident that the Chinese arrivals would not put too much pressure on our healthcare system and we decided at that time not to tighten restrictions. That judgement proved correct.",55,346,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00346
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Sir, throughout the last three years, we had to continually make such tough calls, in the midst of great uncertainty and ambiguity, often without an established playbook to guide us, nor the luxury to wait and see.",56,347,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00347
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We did not get every call right.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"This is the nature of dealing with a crisis. We will always be faced with incomplete information.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Indeed, there will never be a “perfect response” in a crisis that is as complex, unpredictable and fast-moving as COVID-19. In such a crisis, no policy can cater for every eventuality; no plan can be implemented perfectly, because there will always be time pressure and resource constraints.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"On several occasions over the last three years, our healthcare system came under immense pressure.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Testing had to be ramped up nationally, at an unprecedented scale and pace.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Throughout, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) worked closely with research laboratories and infectious disease experts outside of the Government to understand the changing nature of the virus, perform epidemiological modelling and accelerate the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.",64,355,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00355
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Through these collective efforts, we protected our healthcare system from being overwhelmed and averted many deaths.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We will need to build on our plans to strengthen the primary care system, which we are now pursuing through Healthier SG. We will also strengthen the relationships we have established with the private sector through our COVID-19 response, so that in a future pandemic, we can support more flexible responses and faster mobilisation of resources. And while we have done well in our vaccination efforts, our vaccine resilience can be fortified further with local manufacturing capability.",67,358,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00358
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, we must grow our expertise in public health and pandemic management.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We already have some of these capabilities, especially in the area of communicable disease control and management, which we had beefed up after SARS.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To consolidate these capabilities and expertise, we will take the next step to set up a dedicated centre for public health, similar to what many other countries have done in setting up Centres for Disease Control. This will enable us to develop stronger competence in public health and grow these capabilities over time. Later in this debate, Minister Ong Ye Kung will elaborate on these plans.",70,361,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00361
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Second, enhancing forward planning capabilities. Our planning parameters for the pandemic were largely based on the SARS experience. But it quickly became clear that these parameters were not adequate. SARS was a short, regional outbreak, largely confined to hospital settings. COVID-19 turned out to be more transmissible, though less severe than SARS, and the pandemic continued for several years and not just a few months. This greatly strained our healthcare capacity and manpower.",71,362,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00362
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Just as COVID-19 was different from SARS, the next novel pathogen will be different from COVID-19. With SARS, we had a pathogen that was highly severe but with low risk of spread. With COVID-19, we have a pathogen that is only moderately severe, but with higher risk of spread. The more dangerous scenario will be one where we have a pathogen that has both high mortality and high contagion risk.",72,363,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00363
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We will need to broaden the range of baseline scenarios for pandemic planning and review the resources we need to respond to these different scenarios. Being prepared and making investments early can yield immense dividends, especially during a crisis.",73,364,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00364
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But at the same time, realistically, we cannot plan for every possibility. Every new pathogen we meet will involve a degree of dealing with the unknown and it would be prohibitively expensive to cater for a wide range of “worst cases”.",74,365,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00365
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, we will have to strike the right balance to make good use of our limited resources. This may involve planning for contingencies that can be pivoted “just in time” to support our pandemic response, so we do not have to build layers of redundancies that may remain underused outside of a crisis but cost us a disproportionate amount of resources to maintain.",75,366,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00366
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In other words, our response will have to be a combination of preparedness and improvisation.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"That is why we must dedicate resources and equip our crisis management structures with better forward planning capabilities – so we better anticipate and imagine what might happen next, be prepared for the unexpected and be ready to adapt to changing circumstances as they unfold.",77,368,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00368
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"By doing so, we do not have to front-load all of the investments to cater for all contingencies. But we must create a dynamic, forward-oriented organisation and process whose main mission is to anticipate and monitor risks, to keep buying insurance where needed. So, as the crisis develops, we can continue to buy more insurance and options for the future.",78,369,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00369
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To be clear, we did set aside some capacity to do such forward planning during the last three years.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Related to all this is the third lesson – how we can strengthen our resilience as a nation. Our COVID-19 experience has been a stark reminder of our vulnerability. As a small and open economy, we were more badly hit than others by a global disruption that was outside of our control. We found ourselves in situations where it was uncertain whether we could secure critical supplies, even when we were willing to pay a premium for them.",81,372,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00372
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In the early months of the pandemic, we witnessed how other countries had started hoarding essential medical and food supplies, and we grew increasingly concerned about whether we could replenish our own stock. Significant work had to be undertaken to activate emergency procurement measures and to tap on long-standing networks to secure what we needed. We also had to design new processes to keep our port and land links open, but in a safe way.",82,373,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00373
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The pandemic has underscored the importance of building up additional redundancies and buffers that we can fall back upon during a crisis.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides having additional buffers, resilience is also about being more adaptable.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For example, when we first managed to bring protein and meat supplies into Singapore, which we had to do, there was an issue of where to store these goods. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) scrambled, this was under then Minister Chan when he was at MTI, and we eventually solved this by sourcing and bringing in refrigerated containers, what they call ""reefers"", to provide sufficient cold storage capacity and we ramped up the capacity of the power supply to support their operations.",85,376,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00376
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Where possible, the Government will design facilities to be multi-use, so they can be repurposed or redeployed during a crisis.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also need to be able to convert and repurpose existing spaces at short notice into facilities that can be used to meet emergency needs in a crisis. We had faced a steep learning curve trying to do this at the start. Singapore Expo had to be converted into community isolation and care facilities, hotels into quarantine facilities, Community Centres into vaccination centres, and vacant schools and Singapore Armed Forces camps into temporary housing for migrant workers.",87,378,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00378
2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),Each of these processes took a lot of work and learning from this experience.

2023-03-20-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Our private sector partners are a key source of support in these efforts. Working alongside them over the course of the pandemic has showed us all that there is much more that we can do by coming together, by sharing our resources, capabilities and networks. So, we will do more to sustain and strengthen our partnerships with the private sector. For example, through cooperation agreements, to shore up our pandemic preparedness plans and to mobilise our national resources more comprehensively in times of need.",89,380,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00380

2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Post-elections, we raised COVID-19-specific measures in Parliament covering a wide range of issues, such as the MOH's suspected adverse events report, recalibration of COVID-19 controls for Singaporeans visiting their terminally-ill family members, vaccination safety protocols for children, clarifying the Government's position on TraceTogether with regard to its applicability for criminal investigations, the inclusion of non-mRNA vaccines into the National Vaccination Programme and the reasons behind the delay in permitting migrant workers to be reintegrated into the community, just to name a few.",10,401,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00401
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"During my Fortitude Budget speech in June 2020, I reminded the Government that Singaporeans had a right to expect a thorough review and accounting of the Government response to the crisis. I suggested that a Commission of Inquiry, or some other independent body, be appointed to review specific aspects of the Government's response up to that point. I emphasised that whatever form such a reckoning might take, our position as a constructive opposition required us to communicate the feelings of Singaporeans in Parliament, which necessarily includes a public expectation of Government accountability.",11,402,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00402
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, many COVID-19 reports presented through national parliaments the world over saw witnesses called to give feedback through unvarnished testimony, consistent with the substance of government accountability. On 9 May 2022, in response to my Parliamentary Question, this House was informed that the former Head of Civil Service, Mr Peter Ho, was overseeing the COVID-19 After Action Review (AAR) process and that the Government would share the findings and lessons with the public when the AAR was completed.",12,403,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00403
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To that end, the White Paper tabled before the House today states that it “was prepared by the Prime Minister’s Office” and that it draws on Mr Ho's review, which included interviews with key participants in the crisis, both Ministers and civil servants. It incorporates the findings of various reviews by Government agencies as well as the perspectives of the private and people sectors.",13,404,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00404

To those familiar with the study of official history, this document would be referred to as a secondary document. There is an original document from which it draws its findings and conclusions. This original document is not before the House.",14,405,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00405
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While the White Paper acknowledges some shortcomings in the Government response, Singaporeans do not know what has been excluded from the original reports and reviews referenced in this White Paper produced by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Are the contents of this White Paper all the findings from the AAR that the Government is prepared to share with the public and Parliament? Presumably, Mr Peter Ho submitted a more comprehensive AAR report to the Government. Can that report be made public to Parliament so that Members of Parliament and Singaporeans can better understand the breadth of perspectives gathered, the known data and facts, and draw their own conclusions? If there is confidential information within the AAR report that could harm national security if revealed, that could be redacted from the report.",15,406,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00406
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Why did the Government decide against publishing the original review report presented by Mr Peter Ho in full?

2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, Opposition parties, including the WP, were not privy to the deliberations of the Multi-Ministry Task Force or taken into confidence on the Government’s planning processes for its COVID-19 response. In some countries, government approaches to COVID-19 were routinely attacked by parties outside of government in order to gain political mileage. The WP did not do this. We did not ride on misinformation or contribute to misunderstandings over national policies which were either intentionally or unintentionally conveyed. On the contrary, we encouraged Singaporeans to be mindful of rumours or unverified information and to clarify their doubts through the proper channels.",18,409,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00409

2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A most worrisome medical reality of COVID-19 was that it struck hard at our seniors and elderly. We needed to protect them against the much higher risk of severe illness and even death. During our engagement with residents, WP Members of Parliament encouraged our seniors to get vaccinated. Whenever they were undecided or unsure, we encouraged them to clarify their doubts on existing medical conditions with their doctors for peace of mind.",21,412,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00412

Former Member of Parliament, Mr Png Eng Huat, did the same, speaking in Hokkien and sharing his experience, convincing his 92-year-old father to get vaccinated. Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament Ms He Ting Ru shared with the public that she took her vaccination while she was still breastfeeding as there was a concern and confusion that nursing mothers could be passing something dangerous to their babies.",22,413,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00413

When the news suddenly broke out of such mass swabbing, Mr Giam went door-to-door with words of support for residents while working with the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council to assist in the wipe-down and cleaning of the affected blocks, something our cleaners – predominantly migrant workers – did so many times over the last three years to keep our community safe.",23,414,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00414

2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, I will speak on what the public can expect from the WP in future when crises such as COVID-19 strike, as they must be expected to. It seems a long time ago now, but, as early as February 2020, when the Unity Budget was announced, the WP made clear the tone we would take on the COVID-19 crisis. We called for a unity of purpose and for politics to take a backseat. In June 2020, as we exited the circuit breaker, and a few weeks before the elections, I reiterated in my speech on the Fortitude Budget, that the WP did not come in to publicly criticise the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis. We were determined to support, and not undermine, the national effort.",25,416,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00416

2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In WP Town Councils, we implemented the necessary protocols effectively. When some residents expressed frustration at some safe management measures in common areas that came under our responsibility, such as hawker centres, playgrounds and void decks, we dealt with them with empathy and open-mindedness, but without compromising the national measures or the safety of Singaporeans.",27,418,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00418
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"We realised that some rules could prove problematic when operationalised on the ground, and our Town Council officers diligently submitted their feedback to the agencies concerned. We took the view that any feedback would be taken seriously by civil servants and we endeavoured to work as one Singapore. As has come to be expected of our public officers, they did not let us down.",28,419,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00419
2023-03-20-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, the opening quote of my speech paid tribute to those in our community who played a massively oversized role in saving lives. However, there are many outside this House who played an equal part in saving livelihoods. As COVID-19 brought our economy to a near halt, many individuals saw their incomes evaporate. I will never forget my engagement with a group of private-hire bus drivers at the start of COVID-19. These drivers had mouths to feed and vehicle loans to repay, but no business to generate income. Their worries, and even fears, were palpable. These drivers, and others like them, were helped by the diligence of public officers who engaged with financial institutions to withhold the repossession of vehicles. I wish to restate my acknowledgement of these efforts.",29,420,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00420

It seeks to internalise the lessons learnt from our COVID-19 journey and to improve preparedness for the next health pandemic. Doing so would honour the sacrifices made by Singaporeans and the community in our fight against COVID-19. We also stand in solidarity with Singaporeans and our non-Singaporean friends who have lost family members to COVID-19 and to those who suffer from COVID-19 or vaccine-related ailments. I hope the MOH will proactively follow-up with all individuals who have not succeeded in their vaccine injury claims and consider their circumstances and the well-being of their mental health, as appropriate, on an ongoing basis.",31,422,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00422

2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"COVID-19 has resulted in the loss of lives and livelihoods worldwide, including in Singapore. Many workers lost their jobs and income. The workers in the aviation, aerospace and tourism sectors were especially affected when the borders closed. Our self-employed persons (SEPs) were hit especially hard by the sudden loss of income during the circuit breaker.

We are grateful to our healthcare workers. They are the vanguard in winning this battle against COVID-19. Our Public Service officers also deserve no less praise for developing new policies and dispensing assistance at breakneck speed to Singaporeans during the darkest of times.

2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),The National Wages Council (NWC) was convened twice in 2020 when the economy deteriorated rapidly. I was in both of the NWCs. I witnessed how unity prevailed where we could have succumbed easily to self-interests. The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) worked with our tripartite partners and recommended reducing non-wage costs and guided businesses to manage excess manpower to save jobs. We also guided workers and businesses on the efficient use of Government support measures to train and reskill our workers.,6,431,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00431
2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"When the economic problems deepened, union leaders acted swiftly to ensure that retrenchments were minimised to the greatest extent possible.

We provided guidelines to ensure temporary wage cuts were implemented in a reasonable manner.",7,432,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00432
2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),Our union leaders also sought to minimise the overall impact to workers’ take-home pay. They worked with companies to manage wage costs equitably and gradually.,8,433,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00433
2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Our tripartite partners never took our minds off our vulnerable workers. We worked with companies to prioritise non-wage cost-cutting measures. By having higher-wage earners take deeper and faster cuts, we protected lower-wage workers as much as possible. We were able to do so because of the strong trust built over the many years.",9,434,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00434
2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Central to protecting workers was also in placing displaced workers to areas of need. NTUC developed the Job Security Council (JSC) in 2020 to achieve this. Managed by NTUC’s e2i, it is a placement ecosystem with a network of employers that are hiring and releasing workers. At its core, the JSC aims to support businesses in coping with fluctuating manpower needs across the economic cycle while providing support to workers in need. In particular, JSC focused on engaging with at-risk or displaced workers to pre-emptively shorten the unemployment period by helping them find jobs. This proved vital in the aviation, aerospace and hospitality sectors.",10,435,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00435

For example, during the circuit breaker, taxi drivers and private hire drivers saw their income drop rapidly. Sports coaches, art instructors and tour guides saw their income drop near to zero or zero, during the lockdown. Unlike the employees with their companies receiving support from the Government, SEPs were not afforded such support. The mechanism used to provide support to the employees just could not work for them. The Labour Movement quickly took up their cause with the Government. The Government responded strongly with the Self-Employed Income Relief Scheme (SIRS).",19,444,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00444
2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"With the Government stretched immeasurably on many different fronts, the Labour Movement had to step up to administer SIRS. We needed to implement SIRS quickly. The circuit breaker would leave almost all of our SEPs with no income. Our priority was to get these monies into the affected SEPs' hands as soon as possible to provide them with a lifeline during such unprecedented times. Because a sizeable proportion of our SEPs had not previously filed their income, it was operationally challenging to swiftly identify SEPs in need. With the very short lead time, the bulk of the processing of the SIRS had to be done manually. Application systems and forms had to be fine-tuned several times to better serve our SEPs. We also recognised that some of our older ones struggled with navigating online forms and faced difficulties in collating the requisite documentation. NTUC staff stepped up and helped members through every step of the process. The scheme was able to help some 200,000 SEPs to obtain $9,000 to tide through the pandemic.",20,445,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00445
2023-03-20-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The Labour Movement's involvement in implementing SIRS provided us with valuable lessons. The greatest of which was the precarious financial situations faced by many SEPs, especially the lower-income ones. We need to strengthen their financial and career resilience for SEPs. This is especially when the next pandemic is inevitable. We need to support SEPs to improve their career resilience and flexibility through training to deepen their skills and diversify their work portfolios. During periods of business or income disruptions, SEPs also need access to short-term income support. I call upon the Government to look into developing such support which can be tied to their efforts to train and search for jobs.",21,446,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00446

We are starting with the platform drivers and riders. NTUC has also stepped up working with associations to strengthen the income security, welfare and work prospects of our SEPs. We will actively work alongside them with relevant resources and networking opportunities vital to enhancing their career pathways.

2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"We are now no longer fighting COVID-19 like before, yet the shortage of healthcare facilities and manpower still persists. For example, median waiting times for emergency cases that require hospital admission from January to September last year was about seven hours.

2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In October 2016, then-Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong launched the Healthcare Manpower Plan 2020, which highlighted the need for 30,000 more healthcare workers from 2015 to 2020 to look after Singapore's fast-ageing population. It is now 2023. How many of these 30,000 additional healthcare positions have been filled? During the debate on the Healthier SG motion last October, Minister Ong Ye Kung said that another 24,000 nurses, allied health professionals and support care staff are needed to operate hospitals, clinics and eldercare centres by 2030.",6,457,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00457
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Recruitment alone is not sufficient. There needs to be a corresponding transformation in the remuneration of healthcare workers. The group that bore the heaviest burden of caring for COVID-19 patients were nurses. Their long working hours and lower starting pay compared to territories like Australia, Hong Kong and Canada, could have contributed to their high attrition in recent years. In 2021, the proportion of nurses resigning hit a five-year high, with 7.4% of local nurses and 14.8% of foreign nurses leaving their jobs.",7,458,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00458
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Why are so many nurses leaving the healthcare sector? A study on healthcare workers conducted by researchers Celene Ting and others from the Saw Swee Hock School for Public Health, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the NCID highlighted that healthcare workers reported burnout from being overworked, emotional exhaustion and at times feeling a lack of appreciation or support at work.",8,459,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00459
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"This was exacerbated by having to care for difficult and sometimes abusive patients. Nearly a third of healthcare workers witness or experience abuse each week, according to a tripartite workgroup's findings, which the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Rahayu Mazam, shared earlier this month during the Committee of Supply debate.",9,460,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00460
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Additionally, some healthcare workers are also drawn to work opportunities overseas, where they can receive higher remuneration and more societal recognition. For example, a nurse that CNA interviewed mentioned that after moving from Singapore to the US, he felt more highly esteemed by the public, citing an example of how his car loan was approved immediately after he said he was a nurse, despite having no credit history.",10,461,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00461
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),Urgent changes are needed if we are to reverse the departure of nurses and boost their numbers in Singapore.,11,462,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00462
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Nurses' basic pay should be benchmarked to that of their contemporaries in other essential public services. This is a point made by Assoc Prof Jeremy Lim from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health during a recent CNA interview. Such services could include the Police, army and the education service. The salaries of nurses in other jurisdictions like Australia, Hong Kong and Canada should also be considered in the benchmarking.",12,463,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00463
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),It should take into account the longer hours that nurses have to work compared to many other professions. This is to ensure that the opportunity cost of taking up nursing instead of another profession would be minimised. We also need to make the nursing profession more highly esteemed by the general public.,13,464,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00464
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Another way to attract more Singaporeans to take up nursing and increase retention would be to enhance their professional development opportunities. Nurses in Singapore are often still seen as the assistants to doctors instead of being professionals in their own right. They should instead be granted more autonomy and entrusted with higher level responsibilities. In the UK, nurses run clinics, diagnose patients, take on high-level management roles and help to lead medical research. We should accelerate efforts to achieve the target of 700 Advance Practice Nurses by 2030.",14,465,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00465

2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Next, during the pandemic, many persons with disabilities (PwDs) experienced difficulties coping with measures such as the blocking off of regular exits and entrances, shifting access points for PwDs and having to locate and scan SafeEntry codes. Many wheelchair users and people with developmental disabilities, visual impairments and autism spectrum disorder had difficulties with SafeEntry scanning. Measures such as COVID-19 swabbing and mask-wearing were difficult for some people. I recall a resident of mine who was very worried that her son, who had a mental disability, would struggle and hurt himself when made to undergo mandatory swabbing at his block when an outbreak occurred there.",16,467,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00467
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"While support for PwDs was eventually introduced, much of this was reactive. This could be due to an absence of meaningful participation by PwDs when safe management measures were implemented. Moving forward, it would be advisable to have at least one member of the disability community on emergency task forces so that the community's views can be adequately represented. More importantly, all policies rolled out need to take into account the unique needs of PwDs, to ensure that they are not excluded.",17,468,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00468

2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),The fact that the Government knew in those early days that asymptomatic transmission of the virus could occur should have prompted them to advise everyone to wear masks when in contact with other people.,24,475,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00475
2023-03-20-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"On 10 February 2020, four local doctors did just that by issuing a statement urging Singaporeans to wear masks always when leaving home, even if they were well. Dr Colleen Thomas, Dr Judy Chen, Dr Tham Hoe Meng and Dr Lim Pin Pin acknowledged the difficulties in obtaining new surgical masks every day and urged the use of creative solutions like washable cloth masks or scarves. They pointed out that these measures were better than no mask at all.",25,476,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00476

In the US, the Netherlands, Greece, Germany, Japan, Australia and South Korea, the majority of their people see their countries struggling to handle the COVID-19 outbreak in ways that reveal political weakness. Only in Singapore, Hungary, Israel and Sweden does the majority feel the opposite, that the way their country has handled the COVID-19 virus outbreak highlights their country's political strengths. At the end of the day, it is the high trust and confidence that Singaporeans have in one another and in our leaders that have gotten us through the crisis of a generation.

2023-03-20-T-014,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Consistently, the business community has brought up the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) as the lifesaver for many companies, especially the SMEs. JSS was critical in keeping most businesses afloat during the pandemic and preserving jobs for workers by providing wage support for the companies to retain employees.

All these measures, which were urgently needed, were passed into legislation in record time. Looking back, Mr Kurt Wee, President of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME), said  ""COVID-19 brought unprecedented collaboration and cooperation between SMEs and Government. Coordination with ESG was almost on a daily basis, at times, with two to three advisories being disseminated to the business ecosystem. TACs played a critical information bridge hand-in-hand with Government to usher the whole ecosystem throughout the crisis. Strong levels of trust were established.

Given that, in general, 90% of hotel business comes from international travel, with the closure of our borders and subsequent border restriction measures, this industry was severely impacted. I would like to quote Ms Kwee Wei Lin, President of the Singapore Hotel Association  ""Hotels are thankful to the Government for lifelines, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, which had helped to protect the livelihoods of our local employees. This, in turn, ensured that the industry had talents to restart effectively when recovery eventually came. Additionally, the rollout of the Enhanced Training Support package by the Government worked really well for the industry as hotels could optimise the downtime to upskill and reskill their employees to cater to a post-COVID-19 tourism landscape. Additionally, the launch of STB's Singapore Rediscover vouchers in December 2020 was another scheme which helped hotels to keep the lights on and retain its local workforce. The SHA would like to record its appreciation to the Government for helping the industry stay resilient.

Ms Kwee shared how all the hotels stepped forward swiftly to repurpose their properties into isolation facilities to help our nation fight against COVID-19. Isolation, quarantine and SHN was an important line of defence against the pandemic and, at one point, more than half of the 67,000 hotel rooms in Singapore at that time were used in our battle against COVID-19. I am sure all of us in this Chamber will join the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) to express our gratitude to all hotel employees, especially the frontliners, who very quickly adapted to their service delivery to offer compassion and care to guests who had to undergo isolation, quarantine or SHN.

The President of Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS), Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, recalled the chaotic condition at the beginning of COVID-19 breakout due to the lack of direction and coordination among the various Government agencies. I quote Mr Chia Ngiang Hong  ""We agree with the finding in the White Paper that the handling of migrant workers was rather disappointing. As migrant workers are a lifeline to the construction industry, the impact to the industry and consequences were quite significant, as evidenced by the long delays in many construction projects and the collapse of a few big contractors. The reopening of worksites after the stabilisation of the migrant worker situation was rather painful, with volumes of new rules and requirements resulting in painfully slow progress on sites. Fortunately, Minister Desmond Lee stepped in to personally supervise the situation. With his very regular meetings with relevant stakeholders and agencies and very frank exchanges of views and feedback, the situation recovered well and inched towards normalcy. In hindsight, much could have been done differently by everyone, and the White Paper was objective and frank in calling out the issues and the lessons learnt.""",12,541,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00541

In partnership with MOM, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) foundation, with the support of our SBF members, set up MigrantWell, an IPC charity, to establish one of the centres, St Andrew's Migrant Worker Medical Centre, at Penjuru Walk. MigrantWell is also providing care gaps, for example, in dental care for pain management, rehab physiotherapy and mental wellness for our migrant workers.

These are people who are here in Singapore to earn an honest living to support their families back home.

During COVID-19, among the heroes of our frontline workers include our 21,000 public transport workers. Notwithstanding that I am involved with the Public Transport Council, I submit to you that our public transport workers, as do our healthcare workers and all the other frontline workers, deserve our heartfelt appreciation. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the public transport operators kept our buses and trains running so that our healthcare workers and essential workforce can get to where they need to get to, to save lives, to connect Singaporeans to their families even during the phases when it was only two per household allowed, to keep Singapore humming in spite of the pandemic. At the peak of the pandemic, average daily ridership dropped to less than 25% of pre-COVID-19, but it was decided that public transport must be kept available for our essential workers and bus and MRT train service levels were sustained at largely pre-COVID-19 frequencies.",15,544,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00544

When Malaysia announced the closing of borders, our public transport operators (PTOs) worked around the clock to find accommodation to house our Malaysian bus captains and engineers. When the vaccination programme was launched, our public transport workers were given priority access to vaccines. And when there were concerns with the mental well-being of the public transport workers, especially the foreign workforce having to be away from their family and loved ones for prolonged periods, the PTOs leaned in.

He said, and I quote  ""Singapore did a great job at handling the difficult situation during COVID-19.

It was a good thing that the National Jobs Council was already in place, pre-COVID-19, to help workers acquire new skills and competencies necessary for adapting to the changing business landscape.

The common feedback which SBF received from companies is that both the SGUnited traineeships for fresh graduates in 2020 and 2021 and the current SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways for mature individuals are useful in two ways  (1) helping companies lower their risk in taking near-fit on non-fit individuals through the six to nine months of attachment before offering them permanent jobs and (2) helping fresh graduates and mature individuals secure opportunities to get permanent jobs.",21,550,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00550

Singapore Polytechnic (SP), which I am involved with, participated actively in supporting the SGUnited skills programmes, training about 1,200 jobseekers.

Whether a frequent ART swab with instant results, compared to a PCR test that is harder to do which may need a healthcare facility and which cannot be done as often as frequent ART tests at home.

2023-03-20-T-014,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, was the $72.3 billion in COVID-19 packages well spent? Based on what is written in the White Paper and the two occasional papers from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on the COVID-19 Budget measures, what is missing is an assessment on whether each of the different measures was a good use of funds.

2023-03-20-T-014,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"In particular, I feel that the support given to businesses should have been more discriminate. For example, $30 billion was distributed to businesses in wage support. As this was a broad-based measure, even companies that continued to be highly profitable throughout the pandemic were included. It is difficult to understand why companies who can afford to continue paying millions of dollars in executive pay should be receiving wage support from taxpayers. Thirty billion dollars is a big amount and equivalent to a GST collection of 17%. The Deputy Prime Minister has told us that the $40 billion draw from our past Reserves is unlikely to be paid back.

This is a point I have raised before in an Adjournment Motion in January 2022. I urge the Government to look into the circumstances of those who had lost their jobs due to their unvaccinated status. They have paid a heavier price than average in the country's efforts to get the pandemic under control and I think special consideration in the form of employment assistance and financial compensation is in order.",12,619,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00619

It was also a source of great frustration for businesses and organisations that they often had to wait a few days for rules that were specific to their sector to be announced.",7,630,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00630
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I, therefore, believe the call we made in July 2021 is still relevant and that we should ensure that we develop a roadmap for future use, clearly laying out support measures pegged to specific restriction levels. It would also be important to share how the authorities weigh up various factors in deciding what restrictions to impose, along with the level of support that will be meted out to individuals.",8,631,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00631
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"While we all acknowledge that it is difficult to set these matters in stone, having more information and understanding about how decisions are made would be important for both businesses and individuals to plan forward and be psychologically prepared for the various ups and downs that come with any large-scale pandemic, like the one we have just come through.",9,632,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00632
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Still on communications, one area which we perhaps could look into is to work out a system of improving our existing structures to ensure that our agencies are able to more smoothly integrate the information they have and to be efficient in processing this.",10,633,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00633
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I make this comment after receiving feedback from residents and friends who were subject to quarantine orders, who told me that they often received numerous calls from different departments of various Ministries, each asking them for the exact same information which they had already provided. One even told me that an officer turned up at his house to issue a quarantine order the day after he returned to Singapore, after he had spent much time on the phone with and sending documents to various departments and was already cleared from needing to quarantine earlier that same morning due to being a recently recovered patient.",11,634,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00634

2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),One area which we also feel warranted more attention in the review and also our future plans has been the impact that COVID-19 has had on the mental well-being of our population and the development of our children.,13,636,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00636
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"As I mentioned in the recently concluded Budget debate, we appear to be reporting increased feelings of isolation and loneliness and this has a direct impact on our life and healthy life expectancy.

2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Yet, there has been scant mention of well-being and mental health in the White Paper. The pandemic led to job losses, business failures, school closures and families spending extraordinary amounts of time together indoors, which have, in turn, led to unprecedented stress and pushed our coping mechanisms to breaking point.

2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"A 2021 paper by the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) stated that residents in the lower-income groups were more disproportionately hit by lockdown and movement restrictions and that Malay respondents to the study were more likely to report adverse economic effects as a result of the movement restrictions. These areas bear special attention, as such groups may have fallen further behind, particularly in the wake of the high inflation we have been experiencing over the last year.",19,642,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00642
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Additionally, as I mentioned in my speech during the Government's White Paper on Singapore Women's Development, I asked about the effect the pandemic has had on the gender wage gap and the effect of the chronic undervaluing and underpaying of work – paid and unpaid – that is traditionally done by women. This is despite this work being deeply important and essential, as all of us learnt first-hand during the lockdown days in particular.",20,643,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00643

2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"These points have also been backed up by studies and data, such as the United Nations' (UN) findings on the disproportionate adverse effects that COVID-19 had on women and girls, including the negative impact on economic, physical and mental well-being. There was also concern that women and children were being exposed to higher levels of domestic violence and, indeed, in Singapore, there have been findings that family violence has increased from 2020 to 2022.",22,645,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00645
2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I also hope that attention can be given to the still little-known phenomenon that we often refer to as ""long COVID"". This is what happens when survivors of COVID-19 find themselves being plagued with a variety of effects long after they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. These can range from gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath to cognitive impairments, alongside psychological conditions, such as depression and anxiety.",23,646,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00646

We are, therefore, missing the chance to be able to provide more efficient, targeted measures of support and education for these groups, to be given the timely and adequate levels of help that they need.

2023-03-20-T-014,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"There is also a sense that weakened immunity post-infection, coupled with the removal of social interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19, has also led to the circulation of more cases of infectious illnesses like upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and I hope that we can be mindful of this as we track workplace and educational performance for these affected individuals.",31,654,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00654

Now that we have fully shifted to living with COVID-19, I understand and appreciate that the full subsidies previously offered to patients suffering from COVID-19 are being stepped down.

2023-03-20-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It would, certainly, be too intrusive and resource-intensive to monitor workers to ensure that they wear masks at all times and keep the recommended distance between them. So, how can we strike a balance in future pandemics to ensure that everyone takes responsibility for good personal hygiene and follow SMMs?",14,674,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00674
2023-03-20-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Secondly, there were employees who lost their jobs due to VDS. What was the assessment of the support given to these employees? How did the tripartite partners provide guidance to employers through advisories, like the tripartite advisory on managing excess manpower and responsible retrenchment?

2023-03-20-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"How did the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) ensure compliance or should we have done more, like move legislation, to ensure that retrenchments were necessary and done as a last resort?",16,676,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00676
2023-03-20-T-014,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Lastly, due to the pandemic, numerous businesses had to downsize, shut down entirely or pivot operations, which led to retrenchments.

2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"No doubt, at the time, it may have been problematic for GPs to have played more of a role in this effort, at least at the initial stage, due to the very slender staffing and administrative resources that most GPs have. But given the enhancements to the role of GPs that will come about due to Healthier SG, which should see GPs enhance their access to IT and data, for example, I wonder if, in case there is a future pandemic, could GPs play more of a role in the initial response, in terms of vaccination and surveillance?",7,693,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00693
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Why do I ask this? It is for a few reasons.,8,694,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00694
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, GPs are locally based across the island. Citizens would have to travel less, be inconvenienced less and interact less with large crowds of people at collective vaccination centres if they obtain vaccinations at GP clinics.",9,695,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00695
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, GPs may be familiar with patients personally, and that familiarity may facilitate better communication and education and a better and less anxious patient experience.",10,696,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00696
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, anecdotally, it would seem that many GPs are not fully utilised throughout the day in terms of doctor consultation time, though, of course, this is uneven. But I suspect many would have the capacity to take on more of this sort of a role at certain times a day.",11,697,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00697
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"It could be argued that GP clinics lack the manpower and equipment to play such a role. However, manpower and equipment could be deployed to these clinics from a central pool, as needed. It could also be argued that GP clinics lack the physical space to handle large crowds. However, could this not be addressed through scheduling systems that could be run off a centralised IT backbone?",12,698,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00698
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Of course, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not have the time to put in place all of these systems and processes to enable GPs to play more of a role in the initial phase. But for future pandemics, and given the changes we will make for Healthier SG, could we give some thought to how our GP clinics could play more of a role vis-à-vis private healthcare companies?",13,699,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00699
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, next, let me move on to the subject of our migrant workers. All Singaporeans ought to recognise the vital role migrant workers play in our society and all of us should be in favour of treating them with the respect and dignity that should be owed to all workers. In fact, I believe many, if not most, Singaporeans these days strongly favour such principles.",14,700,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00700
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),The COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant workers' dormitories in Singapore will remain a blight on the report card in the way Singapore managed the pandemic. Our health protocols for the next pandemic must include protecting the most vulnerable communities among us. They must not be an afterthought in the next health crisis.,15,701,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00701
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"On this note, I am glad that the COVID-19 White Paper does recognise some of these issues. And I quote from the White Paper  ""In retrospect, the early precautions we took in the dormitories were insufficient. Given the communal living environment, the dormitory outbreak had every possibility of becoming a major disaster. We should have probed deeper and conducted better and earlier ground surveillance, such as by doing dipstick testing on sample populations to make the most of limited testing resources. We also had to make a difficult judgement call on when and how to relax movement restrictions on migrant workers living in dormitories. We could have eased some of the restrictions earlier, especially after most of the workers had been vaccinated and boosted… In the end, we decided to act with an abundance of caution to keep the workers and the broader community safe. But the extended restrictions did take a toll on their well-being.""",16,702,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00702
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Before I go on, I should acknowledge that it was good that the White Paper recognised the room for improvement on the migrant worker front. I also acknowledge Prime Minister Lee's video message to migrant workers during the pandemic, which was helpful.",17,703,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00703
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Widespread infection of the workers could have been mitigated if the Government had taken more decisive action earlier. The light of the oncoming train was flagged out by the NGO Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) as early as 23 March 2020. In its letter to The Straits Times Forum, TWC2 said, ""We call on the Government to announce in advance what plans they have to rehouse workers should clusters break out in dorms. This would give reassurance to the resident and non-resident community.""",18,704,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00704
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The outbreaks at the migrant worker dormitories exposed the cramped conditions that they lived in to many members of the general public for the first time and many Singaporeans were shocked. Despite the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announcing improved standards for dormitories, anecdotes from migrant workers on the ground show that there is uneven enforcement for the smaller dormitories and there is no timeline yet for the purpose-built dormitories which meet these standards.",19,705,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00705
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"As an example of the cost to migrant workers of these measures, here is an excerpt from The Guardian newspaper, 17 April 2020, relating to migrant workers in Singapore  ""The restrictions, an attempt to reduce further transmission, have left the dormitories even more crowded than usual as only essential workers are permitted to leave. One construction worker, from Bangladesh, told The Guardian there were long queues to use shared bathrooms…""",20,706,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00706
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Also, migrant workers lived under prolonged lockdowns when others in the wider Singaporean community could already move freely, despite their vaccination rate already being higher than the average for Singaporeans, affecting their mental health. All movement restrictions were only wound down for migrant workers on 1 March this year. It is good that the White Paper acknowledges that this could, perhaps, have been done sooner.",21,707,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00707
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"A study conducted by Yale-NUS in 2020 concluded that migrant workers under lockdown conditions in dormitories suffered from higher levels of stress and anxiety. A report in the media outlet TODAY in August 2021 read  ""The large number of mental health symptoms reported among workers under complete restrictions suggests that while isolation of whole facilities may be expedient for limiting COVID-19 transmission, this comes at the cost of an increased mental health burden, researchers said.""",22,708,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00708
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Hence, I would like to ask what is the timeline for the improved standards in migrant worker dormitories to be rolled out nationally, including the role of NEST? And will the Government build on this unfortunate experience to develop a clear plan to manage a major infectious disease outbreak in migrant worker dormitories, with all of the massive logistical challenges that will entail?",23,709,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00709
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I also hope that the COVID-19 episode with migrant workers serves as a powerful reminder to all of us to take the well-being and dignity of workers seriously. In particular, enforcement of rules and norms over all kinds of matters like food quality and access to bank accounts and payslips, for example, and hotlines to aid in enforcement, should be in place and be seen to be working properly by the migrant workers themselves. In this House, I recently called for rewards for migrant worker whistle-blowers who expose genuine safety lapses.",24,710,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00710
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There are, potentially, many such ideas through which we can improve the system. And the best generators of ideas are those NGOs who have been working tirelessly and fruitfully to bring migrant worker issues to the forefront of public debate – groups like HOME, TWC2, HealthServe and many others. I hope the Government will lend an active listening ear to such groups, so that, in future, they will not again become like the mythic Greek princess Cassandra, who was fated to utter true prophecies which no one believed and who had to see her prophecies realised.",25,711,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00711
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For at the end of the day, taking care of migrant workers is an urgent question of social justice and fairness.

After all, there is competition for migrant workers from other countries, like the Gulf states for example.",27,713,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00713
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"A robust migrant workers’ rights regime will help us attract workers who can become more skilled and productive and thus help us to reduce the size of the migrant worker population in Singapore, thereby lessening overall population pressures.",28,714,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00714
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And, as I have argued a few times in this House, very skilled tradesmen and technicians from among this migrant worker population should be given an accelerated pathway to Permanent Resident (PR) status and eventually citizenship, so as to strengthen the Singaporean Core in such trade fields.",29,715,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00715
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). I spoke of the migrant worker NGOs who played such a valuable role in the COVID-19 crisis. A more general point I would like to make here is that in future pandemics, there can be a stronger role for NGOs as partners, working with the Government to execute initiatives, but also to inform and critique policies and decision-making, and to disseminate accurate information to their communities.",30,716,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00716

2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"If a future pandemic or other national crisis happens, I hope the Government can assign a more institutional capacity to involving NGOs who are close to their various constituents on the ground, not only in executing projects but also in formulating and refining policy approaches and in making decisions. I had earlier referred to the pertinent advice that TWC2 had publicly aired back in March 2020, and I believe earlier as well, which we would have done well to heed at that point.",32,718,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00718
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One area where NGOs could play an important role is mental health – something my colleague, Sengkang Member of Parliament Ms He Ting Ru referred to. The COVID-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on the mental health of many Singaporeans and people around the world. Due to the general fear and anxiety level, the economic devastation felt by some groups of people even as others prospered and having to work from home and learn from home for prolonged periods.",33,719,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00719

2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In future pandemics and crises, mental health-related NGOs should be empowered, resourced and given information to reach out and persuade those at risk to use the helping resources available, which is not always an easy task and may best be handled by non-state agencies.",35,721,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00721
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One area also where we can boost our mental health care capacity for future crises is in terms of our population of psychologists. In reply to a Parliamentary Question from Sengkang Member of Parliament, Ms He Ting Ru, the Government revealed that our number of psychologists per 100,000 of our population is 9.7. This compares to around 30 in the US and 49 in Canada and France, for example. The same ratio for psychiatrists places Singapore under five, versus, for example, 15 for Canada and 24 for Finland.",36,722,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00722
2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Government scholarships are one tool to increase the number of trained psychologists in the public sector. Training to be a clinical psychologist takes as long as that for medical doctors. Currently, the Healthcare Graduate Studies Award is open to post-graduate courses for Clinical Psychology as one of the 10 other courses of study, such as Audiology, Health Economics and Epidemiology. By contrast, the PSC Scholarship for Medicine and Dentistry targets applications for study only in Medicine and Dentistry. So, the number of post-graduate scholarships dedicated to clinical psychology is probably not as high as for medicine and dentistry and there is no clearly targeted number for clinical psychology alone, for the reasons I explained. This should be addressed.",37,723,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00723

2023-03-20-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The White Paper appears to be a public communication document. In terms of format, evidence of academic and analytic rigour as well as granularity of detail, it stands in stark contrast to a different paper that was published in 2010 by academics on Singapore’s H1N1 pandemic response. That paper was entitled “Influenza A (H1N1-2009) Pandemic in Singapore – Public Health Control Measures Implemented and Lessons Learnt.” The authors were academics Joanne Tay, Ng Yuek Fan, Jeffrey Cutter and Lyn James. No doubt that was an academic paper rather than a Government White Paper, but that paper seems, at the very least, more detailed and, if I may, more clinical in how it marshals facts and uses them to build conclusions. That paper was also authored by independent academics who drew on interviews with MOH and other officials but did not represent the views of MOH. And it has a much fuller methodological note.",39,725,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00725

It appears then that there has been a lapse in the monitoring and enforcement of these new conditions that FCD operators were supposed to have met since 2017.",21,754,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00754
2023-03-20-T-014,Rachel Ong,Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast),"MOM had also launched the DormWatch app in 2018, with the intention for it to be used by migrant workers to give feedback to dormitory operators on issues faced at the dorm. However, NGOs reflect that few migrant workers used the app as many were concerned that reporting issues would cause trouble to their employers and hence also put their jobs in jeopardy.",22,755,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00755

As mentioned earlier, at the start of the pandemic, NGOs stepped in to serve migrant workers in FCDs that were left by their employers to fend for themselves. Some migrant workers had been without food for two to three days before the NGOs found them. Meals were supplied to the FCDs for an extended time period between eight and 12 weeks before NGOs put a hard stop to food supply after informing MOM, calling for employers to be responsible for their workers.",27,760,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00760

2023-03-20-T-014,Rachel Ong,Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast),"I would also like to ask MOM two further questions relating to our crisis response moving forward. First, what are the available means by which employers with genuine needs could flag for help during a crisis so that workers are not left to fend for themselves due to cost pressures?

As workers from different nations do not always enjoy friendly relations with each other, NGOs have found that in migrant workers' communication, it was helpful and important to have a representative from each nationality staying in each dormitory. Where this was missing, NGOs faced situations where food or resources were not evenly distributed to workers from other nationalities in the same dormitory, leading to even greater tensions.",39,772,2023-03-20-T-014-S-00772

2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Another remarkable area that I wanted to highlight is how we as a small, tiny island ensured that vital supplies were not disrupted despite the lockdowns, the border controls, the intense competition for scarce items and the export restrictions by many countries.",20,925,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00925

It must have required the officers to use whatever conventional or unconventional means to secure these supplies, possibly having to deviate from the usual standard operating procedures (SOPs) and instruction manuals (IMs) in such emergency situations.",21,926,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00926
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, the pandemic also exposed several of our vulnerabilities. It was mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Wong as well as Minister Tan. Allow me to also express my views on the two.",22,927,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00927
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"First, on the migrant workers' dormitories. Among the most severe situations or high stress points was the outbreak at the migrant workers' dormitories in this pandemic. The White Paper called it a ""crisis within a crisis"".",23,928,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00928
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Given the communal living arrangements, the dormitories inevitably became a high-risk area in a highly infectious disease outbreak. Fortunately, as what Minister Tan has said, the morbidity and the mortality rate has been very low, notwithstanding the scale of the outbreak there.",24,929,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00929
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"I noted that MOM has since taken significant steps to improve the dormitories' environment, with new standards and continuous efforts to de-risk the exposures. As what Minister Tan said, even with significant improvements in the living environment of these workers, we ought to still continue to institute more defensive measures such as having self-segregating features in the event of a disease outbreak, contingency plans for quarantine arrangements as well as a business continuity plan (BCP) set up.",25,930,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00930
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, the dormitory outbreak also reminded us that there is really a limit as to how much more we can grow our migrant workforce. We must continue to review and weigh the trade-offs of our dependency.",26,931,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00931
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, the second area of vulnerability I want to highlight is mask wearing. The White Paper highlighted the shortage of masks that we had to contend with. Given our domestic constraints, both labour as well as costs, as well as our shift towards more high-value-adding advance manufacturing, producing medical masks domestically may not be economically viable. It is difficult to compete with countries with a much lower cost structure.",27,932,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00932
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Our domestic demand for masks under a non-pandemic environment is not high enough to achieve the scale efficiency for production to be viable. Hence, our medical masks are almost dependent on imports.",28,933,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00933
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In an ironic way, thanks to the transboundary haze situation that we faced years ago, the Government does stockpile a significant quantity of masks, which helped us meet the initial wave of demand when the outbreak happened. But the stockpile quantity was never able to meet that sort of daily consumption demand needed for the entire population in a long-drawn pandemic.",29,934,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00934
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"We scrambled to assemble our own mask producing capabilities so that we can produce some of our mask needs locally. Credit goes to the MTI, Enterprise Singapore and the relevant agencies for getting the mask producing factory up in double quick time, just so that we have some additional back-up supplies.",30,935,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00935
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, in an airborne infectious disease outbreak, masking up can be our first line of defence. As part of a key measure to prepare for future pandemic, we have to designate medical masks as a critical supply item that requires some local production capability.",31,936,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00936
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"However, for the production to be viable, it would require some domestic anchor orders or offtake from the Government so that there is a base level production volume to work with – very much like how the Public Utilities Board (PUB) undertook the liability to buy a certain quantity of desalinated water from water production companies even though it cost more than treated water.",32,937,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00937

2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Firstly, continue to encourage Singaporeans to adopt the mask-wearing habit, especially when they are unwell, in healthcare settings or in highly crowded areas such as public transport or in crowded lifts. This would not only create some local demand for masks but also help to reduce the spread of other airborne diseases such as flu, cold, cough and other influenza.",34,939,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00939
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Studies indicated that there was a sharp decline in flu cases during the pandemic, which could be attributed in part to mask wearing. Just last week, The Straits Times reported that doctors saw a rise of as much as 30% increase in flu cases in the last few months as we unwind almost all our COVID-19 measures.",35,940,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00940
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"If less of our population were infected with flu and cold, we could free up demand for primary care clinics like polyclinics for other patients. There will be more healthy people around, which in turn leads to overall savings on healthcare costs for the population.",36,941,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00941
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Secondly, to encourage the population to wear masks, I suggest that the Government, or perhaps Temasek Foundation, consider continuing the practice of distributing face masks to every Singaporean household each year as a way to encourage the wearing of masks as a responsible social habit, especially if we are unwell. This could be a part of the Healthier SG movement.",37,942,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00942
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, one area that I felt that we have also done well but was not quite well elaborated in the White Paper is the tremendous contributions by the grassroots community volunteers.",38,943,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00943
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The grassroots volunteers rose to the occasion in various pandemic operations in the community. For example, just in Bukit Panjang, we distributed masks and hand sanitisers to more than 50,000 residents, delivered more than 4,000 care packs, groceries and social assistance to residents affected by COVID-19, installed 5,585 bottles of hand sanitisers at lifts and supported the distribution of more 4,000 TraceTogether tokens. Our volunteers also reached out to 12,566 seniors to urge them to go for their rounds of vaccinations. I am sure Members in each of their constituencies have done similar things.",39,944,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00944
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"These and the many other areas are where our grassroots volunteers have selflessly stepped up in this crisis in carrying out some of these duties while at risk of being infected themselves. They made a big difference in the overall health outcomes, providing last mile support and care at the neighbourhood level and, in particular, taking care of those that are vulnerable.",40,945,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00945
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, in conclusion, I would like to point out two underpinning factors that enable our ability to achieve the outcomes that we did as listed in the White Paper.",41,946,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00946
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Firstly, it is our financial strength. There is this Chinese saying, ""钱不是万能，但没钱确是万万不能"". Money is not everything, but not having the financial means is inconceivable.",42,947,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00947
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"When the pandemic landed upon us, the Government had initially drawn on our current Budget surpluses to fund the urgent expenditures in public health defences and the various support measures for businesses and households. Thereafter, we had to draw on the Reserves as the total bill snowballed to $72.3 billion in FY2020 and FY2021.",43,948,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00948
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Given the severity and the magnitude of the crisis, I had expected the Government to do more to support and assist, but I must admit the massiveness and the decisiveness in the series of fiscal interventions were more than I expected.",44,949,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00949
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"It once again demonstrated that the Government may well be cautious and prudent in managing its finances during peace time, but when hit with a severe crisis, the Government would not hesitate to use our fiscal firepower in an impactful way to protect lives and livelihoods. In essence, in 2020, it is the Government's spending that propped up the entire economy.",45,950,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00950
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, during a severe economic downturn, the foremost concerns are often about whether our economic capabilities would be permanently impaired as businesses will run into cash flow problems and some will have to wind down.",46,951,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00951
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The Jobs Credit Scheme, COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and the various financing support made a big difference to help our business stay afloat and safeguarded our capabilities.",47,952,2023-03-20-T-016-S-00952
2023-03-20-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"When air traffic dropped to almost zero for a prolonged period of time, our national carrier SIA posted huge full year financial losses in 2020.

2023-03-20-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),Several Members of this House have spoken up about the clusters that emerged among the migrant worker dormitories and how transmission persisted and infection among migrants workers grew exponentially during the pandemic. This took most Singaporeans by surprise and shone a light on the living conditions of migrant workers.,11,1085,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01085

2023-03-20-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I also appreciate the swift actions taken by the Government, including improving standards of new dormitories for migrant workers and setting up a new MOM division to support migrant workers and dormitory operations. I am also very thankful to hear from the Minister for Manpower earlier on his comprehensive updates on what MOM has and will continue to do to ensure dormitory standards.",13,1087,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01087
2023-03-20-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I hope that this lesson will propel the Government to conduct a systematic scan during ""peace time"" to scrutinise every sector where lower-cost workers, including migrant ones, are employed to ensure that their employers or agents are regulated and made responsible to provide a certain standard of living, employee welfare and resources to integrate them in the community that they are working in, including the community around their work sites or dormitories.",14,1088,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01088

2023-03-20-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I read with great dismay of the jump in the number of cases reported during the pandemic. From 7 April to 6 May 2020, there were 476 Police reports filed for offences commonly associated with family violence. This was a 22% increase compared with the monthly average of about 389 of such cases before the circuit breaker, according to the Police then.",16,1090,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01090
2023-03-20-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),Some partners in social service agencies related to me their concerns and their constraints during those times to respond due to stay-home and safe-distancing measures. More flexibility for social workers and MSF having rights to remove children and family members suffering from family violence during times of crisis must be considered and instituted.,17,1091,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01091

One of the recent breakthrough in the form of Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) allowing the use of CHAS subsidies and MediSave for outpatient treatment via approved telehealth, like video-consultation, needs to be followed through with faster scaling and proliferation of proven telehealth protocols in the treatment of illnesses, especially chronic diseases, including mental illnesses.",19,1093,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01093
2023-03-20-T-019,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"As our population continues to age, mobility issues of more seniors are likely to increase, and the use of hybrid physical and remote telehealth treatment protocols will be of increasing importance. The Government should take the inflexion in adoption of telehealth during the pandemic that we used to protect patients to push on in shaping such healthcare treatment and support as a new norm. This will also address the healthcare workers shortage and over-worked problems, though it will require short-term technology capital investment and change management processes for clinicians and patients.",20,1094,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01094

2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"One of my proudest moments was in the way we reacted in the early days of the pandemic – how we offered free healthcare to anyone struck by COVID-19, regardless of race, nationality or means; how we, being one of the first countries to obtain the vaccine, prioritised according to needs, offering the earliest doses to the elderly and the migrant workers living in dense quarters.",8,1104,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01104
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I was also proud of the way we opened our hearts and our doors to the migrant workers. It was a mistake not to have anticipated the intensity of the outbreak in the dormitories – it meant that nearly half of the 300,000 workers living in dormitories had been infected by 2020. Sadly, two workers died.",9,1105,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01105
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"At the same time, there were many, many in the community who jumped in to help.

2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Students were briefed about the COVID-19 situation in the workers' dormitories and why they needed to share their hostels. Rather than a fear of infection and resistance to strangers living in their midst, the students worked to make the workers feel welcome. Sports teams conducted online morning personal training every day, just like our National Service times. Others held classes to teach them about financial scams. Still others recorded video messages to show their support.",11,1107,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01107
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The human touch was abundantly evident. When doctors working on the ground at the dormitories called for volunteer translators, students from different countries – India, China, Myanmar, Thailand – all took turns to translate these instructions. When the workers finished their stay at the hostels, they were treated to a ""graduation"" ceremony, where they took photos with the university mascots.",12,1108,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01108

2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I also want to reflect on our darker moments. It was indeed confusing when we changed course and took both too much and too little risk. Our safe distancing measures – gathering in groups of two, five, eight, and then back to two – these were a reflection of the dynamic nature of the pandemic. Reality was fast-moving and so too was our response.",14,1110,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01110
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The key was to explain and communicate, continuously and quickly. We may not have always succeeded but the high trust that we had in each other was a key reason we managed some degree of calm and order. The people trusted that we were doing our best as a Government and the Government trusted that people were doing their best to follow fast-changing rules and guidelines. The business community also played their part and the whole Singaporean community also played their part; we all came together, and together, we reaped the returns of the trust, the faith that we had built over the years.",15,1111,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01111

2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Wearing my NTUC Fairprice hat at that time, and working with the Government and the media, we had to assuage genuine fears and anxieties of the general public, among many messages, that supermarkets will remain open, that stocks are available, and if they were not, they were on the way. And at the same time, seeking the understanding and support of the public to only buy what they need and not create their own stockpiles.",17,1113,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01113

Businesses were quite badly affected too. I know, as our NTUC FoodFare and our Kopitiam chains were also caught in this spiral.",18,1114,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01114
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I did raise these issues at the time, but when emotions, fear and uncertainty ran high, and in the trade-off between lives and livelihoods, one would swing on the side of conservatism and safety. We made the right call to be cautious, but we must also be aware of the costs incurred.",19,1115,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01115
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In a pandemic, no amount of reassurance and communications can eradicate the fear and anxiety we faced. At the same time, we need a healthy dose of agnosticism in the face of so much that we do not know – we recognise that our injunction against mask wearing was over-done. It was hubris to think we knew what was unknowable, at that time.",20,1116,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01116
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"And here, I want to acknowledge that it was plain good luck that we were not hit by a deep and severe spread during the ""no need for masks"" early days, and that when COVID-19 hit us in full force later on, we already had our masks and we had our sanitisers.",21,1117,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01117
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"However, it was not luck that allowed us to restock our supermarket shelves overnight. After the onslaught of panic buying, it was not luck that enabled the Government to inject money into our system without borrowing. It was also not luck that we got supplies of drugs, food and vaccines – for a country that imports 90% of our food, we never once went hungry.",22,1118,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01118
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"All these were possible because of, one could say, plain and boring virtues – very Singaporean things, like long-term planning, careful husbandry of Reserves, technocratic, technical and engineering capabilities during decades of peace and prosperity, hoarded for this one-time use.",23,1119,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01119

NTUC was one among many which did our part. In 2020, the NTUC Enterprise group of social enterprises rolled out a $50-million package to provide holistic support for Singaporeans to cope with the pandemic. In the following year, another $20 million was committed to help the community tide over the second year of the pandemic.",24,1120,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01120

2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Let me give you a boring example in logistics. During this COVID-19 period, NTUC Fairprice expanded our warehouse capabilities to support additional storage requirements. During COVID-19, we had to adapt, and we successfully set up an alternative warehouse. We did this within five days. We converted a brick-and-mortar store to an online fulfilment centre within three weeks, again to meet the surge in online orders.",27,1123,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01123

This incident had affected a few vessels that were transporting some of the supplies and products that we had ordered. The near real-time alert had bought us precious time to execute our contingency plans, thus avoiding supply chain disruptions.",29,1125,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01125
2023-03-20-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Today, we are more agile. We have further diversified our sources of supply, covering over 100 countries and we are constantly looking to strengthen our network of suppliers to avoid any over-reliance on any one source. So, yes, whilst we still carry a lot of eggs from Malaysia, we also have eggs from Australia, New Zealand as well as, certainly, from our local farms. And over this COVID-19 period, we have added Spain, Ukraine and Poland as additional sources for eggs. And just last month, we added Brunei to the list of countries supplying eggs to us.",30,1126,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01126

2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, on resources. Early on in the pandemic, we saw how other countries implemented nationalistic and protectionist policies to restrict the export of essential medical supplies like medical-grade face masks, as demand spiked locally. Being an import-dependent economy, Singapore initially suffered difficulties in securing critical medical supplies.",3,1133,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01133
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Also, in early-2020, many countries, including Singapore, saw panic buying and hoarding of essential supplies amid the uncertainty and the prospect of having to be confined at home. In Singapore, we did well to keep supplies flowing and assuage Singaporeans of our sufficiency. In reviewing our stockpiling strategies, I hope the Government will make the revised comprehensive list of critical items known to the public. As Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned, I was glad to hear that there will be a fore-planning team and department that will be set up for future crises. The essential thing is whether we can determine what is the level of redundancy we need for each resource. While some of this information would concern national security, a limited disclosure to the public would reassure Singaporeans that we are disruption ready.",4,1134,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01134
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There will, inevitably, be an additional cost as we build buffers and diversify our supply chains. Importantly, have we calculated how much more we are willing to pay for such ""insurance"" as compared to buying ""just enough"" and from the cheapest source? Moreover, does this mean that our Government procurement guidelines need to be amended to facilitate this aim or do the existing value-for-money metrics accommodate this objective to ""insure"" ourselves against unknown shocks?",5,1135,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01135
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, as we invest in boosting our local production capacity, our natural constraints mean that we will still have some reliance on foreign sources to augment our domestic solutions. Many Singaporeans may not know this, but we have Singapore-based PUB officers constantly stationed at the Johor River Waterworks in Kota Tinggi, Malaysia, to ensure the smooth supply of imported water into Singapore. So, yes, we have a group of Singaporeans who are working in Kota Tinggi on a daily basis.",6,1136,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01136
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"While these officers commuted daily across the Causeway pre-COVID-19, many of them had to make personal sacrifices and spent up to one month per shift away from their families when the pandemic-related travel restrictions were in force. They, like many others, are the unsung heroes in our fight against COVID-19 and we are all deeply grateful, and to their families too.",7,1137,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01137
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, on infrastructure. The collaboration between our public and private sectors enabled large-scale care facilities to be mobilised and demobilised at speed during the pandemic. This helped to manage the stress on our permanent healthcare facilities as the number of cases peaked and ebbed. I look forward to hearing more concrete plans on how the Government intends to design its facilities to be multi-use and re-deployable into accommodation, medical and other critical facilities during a crisis.",8,1138,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01138
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, I am also concerned about more bespoke infrastructure for which substitutes are not readily available. For example, Members may remember the publicised COVID-19 cluster outbreaks at the Jurong Fishery Port in July 2021 and Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre in September 2021. As these are key nodes for the distribution of seafood, fruits and vegetables to our supermarkets, wet markets and hawker centres, it was unsurprising that these outbreaks grew to become one of Singapore's biggest community clusters with more than 1,000 linked cases. The PPWC had to close and cease operations for three days. In Toa Payoh East, for example, at the Toa Payoh East Lorong 7 wholesale night market in my constituency, they were similarly affected and closed voluntarily for two weeks after COVID-19 cases were discovered.",9,1139,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01139
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, I would like to commend the National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and Enterprise Singapore for responding quickly to manage the virus spread and help traders activate alternative supply arrangements. And they have done so in Toa Payoh East, too. Going forward, we may need to look at our preventive strategy to manage disruptions at such bespoke hubs and assess if there is sufficient capacity at alternate distribution ports and centres to handle contingencies that cripple a particular distribution centre.",10,1140,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01140
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, on manpower, Mr Speaker. A big plus that did not seem to be highlighted adequately in the White Paper is how we managed to effectively redeploy manpower to where it is needed. One example would be how around 3,000 Safe Distancing Ambassadors and enforcement officers were deployed and coordinated by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment (MSE) to ensure compliance with safe management measures (SMMs) and vaccination-differentiated SMMs in public spaces.",11,1141,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01141
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"When commercial flights were suspended during the height of the pandemic, the Public Service Division (PSD) quickly worked with the private sector to redeploy aviation workers to fill urgent manpower needs in both public healthcare institutions and public agencies. There was an added level of efficiency as the aviation staff already had the competencies to deliver basic care as Care Ambassadors.",12,1142,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01142
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, I am glad that the White Paper has acknowledged the transferability of certain competencies across multiple jobs or roles, in suggesting that the Government will put in place a more centralised system to tag crisis-time roles and training suitable individuals ahead of time.",13,1143,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01143
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I have previously advocated for rationalising disparate jobs and industries in our economy and identifying overlapping or complementary skillsets or competencies. This can form the basis of our other policies, for example, offering better job matching and placements at our Community Development Councils (CDCs) and other agencies; or designing more structured training pathways under initiatives like SkillsFuture, where workers can progressively train in cross-sector skills and competencies.",14,1144,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01144
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Separately, has the pandemic also helped to strengthen the Singapore Core in our workforce? While it should remain Singapore's strength to remain open to the world even in trying times, the prolonged pandemic has seen expatriates and migrant workers return home to be with their families with no certainty of return. I hope MOM and relevant agencies are already looking or will be looking at the data on the trend of foreign workers and pass holders from before the pandemic up till today, to assess and mitigate our manpower vulnerabilities going forward.",15,1145,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01145
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, on mindsets. As the White Paper noted in the lessons to be learnt from this COVID-19 episode, adaptability and flexibility will continue to be key in tackling future pandemics or crises. Mr Speaker, in Malay please.",16,1146,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01146
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] This is also an opportune time to reflect on the contributions and sacrifices that the Malay/Muslim community has made at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. From Malay/Muslim frontline workers such as doctors, nurses, social workers, delivery riders, safe distancing ambassadors and all those who worked day and night, including members of the Cabinet and Ministry staff who drafted policies, regulatory amendments and budgetary measures quickly to deal with the COVID-19 crisis at its peak, I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you.",17,1147,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01147
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In addition, our religious and Malay/Muslim agencies also stood out. Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (Muis) and the Office of the Mufti provided clear directions in line with Islamic teachings during those tough times as we had to scale back on physical attendance to congregational prayers and other important religious practices. Provisions were specially made for vulnerable groups, reminding all of us of the need to protect the well-being of our community while performing our religious duties. The use of digital technology is a good measure implemented for prayer sessions and congregational prayer slots in mosques which was done quickly and was well-coordinated.",18,1148,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01148
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I am also touched and proud of the community's ability to rally together, such as under SGTeguhBersatu. The task force, with the support of our social workers and religious teachers, came up with a psycho-social resilience framework to nurture a new norm of a resilient self, family and community, and set up a Care Network and interactive e-forum to help everyone affected cope with the disruptions to their daily lives. MENDAKI also helped our students in need to procure digital devices for online learning, while Muis, the mosques and Islamic education centres and providers helped equip our asatizah with the skills to provide religious content online.",19,1149,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01149
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I also would like to take this opportunity to thank the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI) for their forthcoming support to companies, small businesses and families during the pandemic. They demonstrated how a true “gotong-royong” spirit can drive resilience in the community.",20,1150,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01150
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"(In English)  Mr Speaker, in English. I am sure many of us can agree that one positive from the past three years is the acceleration in our digitalisation journey. Not only has GovTech rolled out nationwide, data-driven tech solutions like SafeEntry and TraceTogether as part of our pandemic management measures, ordinary Singaporeans have also gotten comfortable with operating in the digital space.",21,1151,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01151
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There are a fair number of seniors in my constituency in Toa Payoh East and I am extremely heartened when they share that they are now able to talk to their grandchildren more often over video calls or watch performances online over Zoom and I think, more importantly, also be able to make bill payments to agencies in the comfort of their own homes.",22,1152,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01152
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"More of our heartland merchants and hawkers are also hooked up onto digital payment solutions and electronic delivery platforms which were hastened during the COVID-19 period. This is all, in part, down to the efforts of NEA and SFA to reach out to stallholders during the pandemic. These intensive outreach efforts had also helped to achieve a 99.9% vaccination rate across hawker centres, wet markets and coffee shops and to implement the rostered routine testing regime to test thousands of hawkers and workers, which allowed our hawker centres, wet markets and coffee shops, to maintain operations and serve the local communities. This rostered routine testing at the covered plaza in Toa Payoh East and Lorong 8 Toa Payoh has played a part to reassure safety to residents and hawker patrons in those markets. On behalf of the residents and hawkers at Toa Payoh East constituency, I really do commend the swift efforts by the agencies which minimised COVID-19-driven disruptions for all.",23,1153,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01153
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, even as we emerge from the pandemic and transit back into more in-person activities and interactions, I hope the Government and communities alike will continue to sustain the momentum behind our digitalisation efforts post-COVID-19.",24,1154,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01154
2023-03-20-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Deloitte Insights report points out, following COVID-19, governments should strive to transform their operations not only in healthcare but in areas like service delivery, workforce regulation and procurement. I am proud that Singapore is in the lead, taking stock of what they have done well and what can be improved, from its response to this crisis of a generation. However, we cannot stop at these conclusions. With the support of the public, private and people sectors, I have faith that we will act specifically to make us more resilient and prepared for the next crisis, whenever it hits in whatever form.

2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Much has happened over the last three years and what has made it possible for us to be where we are today are the close partnership and trust amongst all stakeholders – Government, agencies, businesses, private and people sectors and, most importantly, Singaporeans and those living in Singapore and interacting with Singaporeans. We must thank our frontline workers and everyone who contributed, many who worked hard behind the scenes, unknown and unseen, and probably will never be known by many of us, and the many sacrifices that were made in this journey.",2,1158,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01158
2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"While we debate today on what went right or wrong, let us not miss some key points made in the White Paper which I think are worth repeating.

2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The White Paper is comprehensive. The Prime Minister Office (PMO) team and Mr Peter Ho who put it together have given a good account of our journey through the pandemic, covered the major areas and issues and lessons learnt.

2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In all stages of the pandemic, we must acknowledge that in order to protect lives and livelihoods, it required adapting as the situation changed.

2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"On balance, as outlined in the White Paper, we maintained effective, timely and accurate communication. With channels like the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) press conferences, a dedicated Gov.sg WhatsApp channel, timely sharing of information, both good and bad, as well as the outlining of plans, these played a major role in maintaining public trust. The efforts to ensure the countering of misinformation and scams and corrective actions like Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) prevented the spread of falsehoods and panic amongst our people.",9,1165,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01165
2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"We must give credit that public communications was well-managed overall. But as with all things, there were challenges related to the access of information or clarity, and that affected individual situations which did have ramifications on their movement, access to services and safety. Communications was not easy given that there was constant change and need for adaptation.",10,1166,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01166
2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"To illustrate the point, let me give some examples – this is not exhaustive – of appeals for help that I received from residents.

2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Example one, I had a resident who needed help with test results and status as well as update of TraceTogether App status. She made numerous attempts to call the MOH hotline to seek clarity but was unsuccessful over the course of more than a week. Even when she did get her call answered the persons who handled her call were unable to advise her or they gave her conflicting information. Why she needed the information was because she was required to provide her employer with the information as it was more than nine days that she had been away from work.",12,1168,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01168
2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Example two, this example related to the vaccination status on the TraceTogether App. For this resident, after receiving the second vaccination, his vaccination status was not updated. Even after waiting for two weeks after the second vaccination and sending the query form as directed by the MOH website and calling the hotline, he was informed that nothing could be done and that the matter was being escalated. When the resident reached out to me, it was already a month. With vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS), he was unable to gain access to most places as his TraceTogether App indicated that his ""vaccination was in progress"".",13,1169,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01169

2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I agree with Lesson 07 of the White Paper which outlines the importance of continuing to deliver transparent and clear public communications to build trust and ensure effective response in a crisis. From the examples that I shared, there is also a need for channels of effective two-way communications and engagement for support and help when individual situations required it. The White Paper rightly outlined that we should have directed more resources to frontline crisis communication, especially at case management and the need for tight information flow between the various stakeholders. I agree and I recommend that we should also consider bringing this closer to the community and build structures and capability in ""peace time"" to achieve this.",16,1172,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01172
2023-03-20-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"What do I mean by this? While directing more resources is required, from past experience, we have seen that even with more resources directed, it is not always possible or sustainable to resource support for peak loads.

2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"On access to food, water and other essentials, throughout the pandemic, Singaporeans had uninterrupted access to food, water and essential items. However, we cannot take this for granted and assume that the global supply chain would remain intact, with ports, ships, airports and air cargo operating normally.",8,1196,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01196
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"Our continued access to essentials was possible because Singapore's robust supply chain management system could quickly adapt to the pandemic's changing circumstances.

2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"The litmus test was when Singaporeans were able to walk into heartland markets, NTUC, Sheng Siong or Cold Storage, and all the shelves were stocked.

2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"On safeguarding our industries and livelihoods, one key aspect of safeguarding local industries was Singapore's agility in locally re-tooling and building COVID-19 capabilities. Companies such as Razer Technologies quickly built up manufacturing capabilities to produce masks. Hope Technik designed and retrofitted COVID-19 buses with high-flow HVAC systems to transport patients. Mirxes developed COVID-19 testing kits and Singapore Airlines redeployed its pilots and cabin crew to provide essential services such as contact tracing and patient care.",13,1201,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01201

2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"On safeguarding our heartlands and community. Jurong Spring has one of the busiest markets. I have personally observed how COVID-19 affected hawkers and stall owners. I must share that the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) played a critical role in coordinating and implementing safe management measures (SMMs) and vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) in public spaces. At the height of the pandemic, over 3,000 Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Enforcement Officers were deployed daily at public areas such as malls, parks, hawker centres, and coffee shops to ensure compliance with SMMs and VDS. In addition, there are over 114 hawker centres and wet markets and over 1,200 coffee shops. This is no mean feat.",15,1203,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01203
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"Overall, in Jurong Spring, there was zero COVID-19 deaths within the market and hawker centres, and all the hawker centres and market stalls remain open till today. No one went out of business. This was because MSE officers had a close working relationship with the hawker and market stall holders. There was deep trust in their working relationship. The officers were understanding, pragmatic and agile in their execution to ensure that operations were conducted safely, but yet nuanced with commercial and economic practicalities when possible.",16,1204,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01204
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"This strong working relationship was further validated when collectively together with the local community, NEA and SFA conducted intensive outreach efforts and achieved a 99.9% vaccination rate among stallholders rapidly.",17,1205,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01205
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"Between July 2021 and February 2022, NEA and SFA also worked with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to implement the Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) regime, which regularly tested around 24,000 hawkers and stakeholders at markets and hawker centres, as well as some 39,000 workers in food courts and coffee shops. One of these RRT centres were actually just behind the Block 505 market in Jurong Spring. These efforts actually helped to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the community and safeguard the health of stallholders and patrons. Operations in local and regional testing centres were strategically located and professionally operated.",18,1206,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01206

2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),Our heartland shops were also deeply affected by COVID-19 but the impact was quickly mitigated with the swift and professional response by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI). MCI played a crucial role in supporting the digitalisation of heartland shops in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was in response to the need to enable heartland shops to operate remotely and maintain their businesses during the pandemic.,21,1209,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01209
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),I remembered how useful it was to the hawkers when MCI launched the Hawkers Go Digital programme in June 2020. It quickly enabled my hawkers and heartland businesses to digitalise their operations overnight and adopt ecommerce capabilities.,22,1210,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01210
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"My hawkers were very supportive of the programme and were provided end-to-end support with funding and education. As a result, numerous heartland businesses were able to adopt digital solutions such as epayments, online ordering platforms, and delivery services. All these would not have been possible or accessible to them.",23,1211,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01211
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"After digitalisation, hawkers needed a platform to sell. Once again, MCI stepped in to assist. They worked with industry partners to develop digital tools and platforms that supported heartland businesses and brought their products and services to the market. For example, MCI collaborated with the food platform Grab to launch GrabFood Hawker Picks. This service gave customers a curated list of hawker stalls for delivery and takeaway.",24,1212,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01212
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"Our seniors were also greatly affected. Many of them never had a smartphone in their lives. So, yet again, MCI worked hard to increase digital adoption among seniors and vulnerable groups during the pandemic. It launched the Digital Ambassadors Programme, which recruited and trained volunteers to help seniors. It has benefited my residents a great deal. As a result, today, we have a better and well-connected senior population than ever before. Most of them are able to use Zoom, WhatsApp, TikTok and Facebook as well, to connect and progress and find new friends and extend their network.",25,1213,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01213
2023-03-20-T-019,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"There is much to be appreciative of. Many of our lives here were safeguarded by the collective actions of frontline staff, unsung heroes from the public and private sector, community volunteers and caring neighbours. It was not a perfect outcome, but there was every intent to ensure we achieve the best possible outcome and for Singapore to survive.",26,1214,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01214

2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Over 6.6 million lives were lost globally, including 1,331 in Singapore. The global economy took a severe hit. Our country's economy contracted by 4.4% and suffered its worst recession since Independence. Several industries such as aviation, hospitality and the aerospace industry were brought to a literal standstill, threatening people's livelihoods.",2,1218,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01218

2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The impact of COVID-19 was unprecedented in many ways. Streets, schools and offices were empty during the circuit breaker. People were separated from their loved ones during festivities such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali and Christmas. Even places of worship were empty as we all took the collective responsibility to stop the spread of this pandemic. It was indeed the crisis of our generation.",4,1220,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01220
2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The crisis tested our values as a society. It laid bare what we would be willing to do to support one another. Now that the pandemic has passed, it is an opportune moment to reflect on how we perform as a society and what values will we like to shape the future of our society. Three critical values that emerged during the pandemic were trust, care for each other and the resilience of society.",5,1221,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01221
2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, trust was essential during the pandemic, whether in each other or in the authorities and various agencies. Compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and guidelines was essential, and it became everyone's responsibility to practice basic hygiene for the greater good. Additionally, when the guidelines changed during the pandemic, such as group size, distancing and mask wearing, we trusted the view of experts and adapted quickly. At work, new requirements were implemented due to the pandemic. Staff had to be split into two teams to minimise contact between employees. In factories, even during breaks, workers had to be separated from one another. Additionally, masks had to be worn by those in high-risk jobs, such as those for our delivery workers.",6,1222,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01222
2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In many other countries, even basic needs, such as the wearing of masks, became highly contentious and heavily politicised issues. Thankfully, this was not the case here. We trusted the advice of experts and implemented necessary measures without delay. By doing so, we were able to move forward without losing valuable time and energy on unnecessary debates.",7,1223,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01223
2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, caring for each other was crucial during the pandemic, where we witnessed an unprecedented outpouring of care for one another. The pandemic has brought to light the sacrifices that workers make to support society. Among them are healthcare workers who continued to serve tirelessly even during the early days when little was understood about the virus. As the number of cases increased, healthcare workers put in longer hours to ensure our healthcare facilities were not going to get overwhelmed.",8,1224,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01224
2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In addition to healthcare workers, our essential workers, driven by a sense of responsibility, have also made numerous sacrifices to continue serving society despite their own reservations and even those of their families. Workers in industries such as transportation, platform workers, aerospace and ports, and water and electricity industries, have played a crucial role in keeping our infrastructure running amid these challenging times.",9,1225,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01225

2023-03-20-T-019,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The Government's financial support for businesses, workers and individuals was unprecedented. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), for example, helped businesses affected by the economic slowdown by paying for their workers' salaries, saving an estimated 165,000 jobs and reducing the unemployment rate. As someone from the aerospace industry, I personally witnessed how the JSS assisted companies to retain workers and allowed companies to use the downtime to reskill our workers.",11,1227,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01227

Grassroots volunteers such as Mdm Uma, Mr Raymond Phua, Mr Rajeev and Mr Charlie Cheong, all volunteers from Pasir Ris East, were among the first to offer food packs and rations to families who were quarantined at home.

One of the best memories that I recall fondly was when our community joined hands to support healthcare workers during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. From giving words of encouragement to driving them home from the hospital for free, the COVID-19 crisis has shown our ability to come together and help each other in critical times.",26,1242,2023-03-20-T-019-S-01242

2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The first reason is biodiversity. We have a rich marine ecosystem of mangroves, mudflats, coral reefs, intertidal zones and seagrass meadows. We are home to 25% of the world's coral species, 55% of mangrove plants in Asia and 52% of seagrass species in the Indo-Pacific. These numbers may continue to increase as we discover and rediscover more species.",8,1272,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01272
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Neptune's Cup Sponge, thought to be globally extinct, was rediscovered near St John's Island in 2011. Just last year, we discovered three new species of moss animals in the Sisters' Islands Marine Park.",9,1273,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01273

2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"At last year's United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15), the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was adopted to conserve 30% of the world's land, coastal areas and oceans by 2030. Singapore has committed to contribute to these global targets and I am glad that, once again, Singapore is playing a role as a responsible international party.",11,1275,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01275
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The second reason our marine ecosystems are important is climate change. Marine ecosystems trap carbon and keep it from worsening climate change. How much carbon?,12,1276,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01276
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Looking at just our mangroves, a 2015 study found that they contain as much carbon as the annual emission of 620,000 people. Mangroves also help in adaptation efforts against sea level rise and coral reefs reduce wave energy. Such nature-based solutions against climate change can provide over one-third of the mitigation needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. They need to be part of our roadmap to net zero.",13,1277,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01277
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To help these marine ecosystems to be our swords and shields against climate change, we should protect them. How can we further protect our marine spaces? I have three proposals to learn more, protect more and restore what we have lost.",14,1278,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01278
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"These are not my ideas but what our young researchers and activists, Sam Shu Qin, Inez Alsagoff and Samantha Thian are calling for. Many of our marine advocates are up in the gallery. This is their Adjournment Motion.",15,1279,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01279
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The first proposal is to learn more about our marine spaces. We have many passionate scientists who are studying our marine spaces. One such scientist is Sam. She is a coral scientist who has been actively studying our coral reefs.,16,1280,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01280
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Scientists like Sam are working hard to study our marine spaces. However, there remain gaps in our knowledge and they need the Government's support to continue and intensify their work. Our last marine biodiversity survey was in 2015. The last edition of the Singapore Red Data Book List on species in Singapore was in 2008. Our database of knowledge is due for an update.",17,1281,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01281
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I hope that the Government can provide support to and work with researchers to update and plug gaps in our existing knowledge on our marine ecosystems.,18,1282,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01282
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Knowledge can be translated into action. In addition to her research work, Sam co-founded “Our Singapore Reefs”, which connects marine enthusiasts through diving and raises awareness on marine biodiversity through outreach programmes. She tells me, “I envision a future where we can all work hand in hand to create spaces where wildlife can co-exist with humans. Together with our research, conservation and community initiatives, we can better safeguard our native biodiversity and keep our ecosystems healthy with more legislation, funding support and long-term partnership from the Government.”",19,1283,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01283
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second proposal is that as we learn more about our marine spaces, we also take steps to protect these spaces. We should designate more marine areas as nature reserves or marine parks.",20,1284,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01284
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Nature spaces that are designated as nature reserves, national parks or public parks enjoy protection under the Parks and Trees Act. Nature reserves and national parks get the most protection. Any changes to their boundaries can only be amended after debate in Parliament. But public parks like marine parks do not enjoy the same level of protection. Their boundaries can be redrawn without the scrutiny of Parliament.",21,1285,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01285
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This is not just a hypothetical possibility. In 2001, the Government had already finalised plans to reclaim the Chek Jawa wetlands. This unique habitat – home to mudskippers, dugongs, herons and otters – was on the verge of being destroyed. But these plans were suspended only after activists commissioned a biodiversity survey, wrote their own report and submitted a petition to the Government. It was a shining day for activism. But we should not protect our marine spaces only when ordinary people take extraordinary action. These areas deserve statutory protection.",22,1286,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01286
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Which areas should we protect? As our first marine park, the Sisters’ Islands Marine Park should receive more protection by elevating it to a nature reserve. The waters around the islands of Pulau Ubin, Pulau Semakau, Pulau Hantu, Pulau Jong, Pulau Biola, Pulau Satumu, St John’s Island, Kusu Island and Lazarus Island are all rich in biodiversity and have great potential as marine parks. I hope we can designate these areas as marine parks first before subsequently considering them to be nature reserves.",23,1287,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01287
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"These waters are familiar to Inez, who is an avid diver and a nature guide. She shared this with me  “As a frequent diver, I have had the opportunity to conduct research with NUS and explore Singapore's Southern Islands. I have witnessed first-hand the remarkable biodiversity present in our waters, including sightings of blacktip reef sharks, blue-spotted fantail rays, large groupers and vibrant coral ecosystems. I strongly believe that we need to take action to protect our marine spaces and ensure their conservation for future generations.”",24,1288,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01288
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The third proposal is that we go beyond protecting what we have to restoring what we have lost. Our community of activists is working hard on the ground to protect our marine spaces. Samantha Thian, who founded Seastainable, is one such activist.",25,1289,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01289

2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We can start by restoring our degraded seagrass meadows. Currently, the Tropical Marine Science Institute is studying the restoration of marine habitats such as seagrass meadows. While seagrass may not receive as much attention as coral reefs, they are crucial as carbon sinks, home to rich biodiversity, improve water quality and protect our coast.",28,1292,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01292
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Seagrasses are 35 times faster than tropical rainforests in capturing carbon. They are also nurseries to fishes and feed marine creatures such as parrotfishes, turtles and dugongs. Despite their importance, we have lost 1.6 square kilometres or about half of our seagrasses since the 1960s.",29,1293,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01293
2023-03-20-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"It is critical that we not just protect but restore our degraded seagrass meadows. The largest meadows today are found at Chek Jawa, Pulau Semakau and Cyrene Reef. There are also substantial meadows in the waters of Pulau Pawai, Labrador Beach, Pasir Ris Beach, Changi Beach and Pulau Sekudu. I hope the Government can support efforts to restore seagrass meadows in these areas.",30,1294,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01294

I also saw first-hand the tremendous dedication by the researchers, activists and thousands of people, members of the public who stepped forward to speak up and fight for the protection of Chek Jawa. And I also saw how the Government responded positively, reversed our decision and protected Chek Jawa instead.",34,1298,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01298

However, restlessness from COVID-19 piqued Singaporeans' interests. Visitorship on the islands increased by 2.5 times, from 6,800 a month in 2019 to 17,000 a month in 2021. In 2022, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) conducted a long-term plan review (LTPR) and engaged more than 13,000 participants in polls, discussions and webinars, which culminated in roving exhibitions. Together with some marine scientists and environmental advocates, I toured the exhibition and was interested in how the LTPR highlighted the creation of an island of ""green, blue and fun"" by expanding nature-based recreation networks and embracing islandness. This includes plans to transform our Southern Islands.",4,1305,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01305

2023-03-20-T-021,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"While it is exciting to hear new plans and see Singaporeans engaged in these nature spaces, the Southern Islands must be developed sensitively. Given that the Southern Islands are more or less a blank slate, it would be exciting as well to testbed sustainable ideas and the learnings could be implemented on mainland Singapore.",6,1307,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01307
2023-03-20-T-021,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),Some may wonder what is there to protect in the first place. The Southern Islands are significant in two key areas  natural and cultural heritage. The Southern Islands support coastal habitats to several nationally vulnerable or endangered species. It is also home to a rich culture and history. The islands were part of the lively settlements of Orang Laut and former islanders have religious significance and hosted Singapore's first quarantine centre – when we are talking about COVID-19 today.,7,1308,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01308
2023-03-20-T-021,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Given the natural and cultural significance of the Southern Islands, I appreciate the efforts of NParks, which engages and consults stakeholders and URA for adopting a science-based approach to stewarding green and blue spaces through the ecological profiling exercise (EPE). The EPE showed that the Southern Islands is a space where development should be considered sensitively.",8,1309,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01309

In recent times, we have seen two activities introduced. First, aquaculture activities taken over by Barramundi Asia Group, just beyond Bendera Bay. I note that the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) had completed an environmental impact assessment (EIA) before implementation. How does the Government measure ongoing water and sediment quality as well as the potential presence of larger predators, given that the fish cages are barely 50 metres from Bendera Bay, which is stewarded by Friends of Marine Park?",10,1311,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01311

Like the throngs who flocked to the Southern Islands during COVID-19, staycations were also a popular activity during COVID-19. I think opportunities for Singaporeans to connect with nature are good, especially for our young, who are more likely to fall in love with our environment if they are familiar with it. I echo comments from the marine community, and I sincerely appreciate the Sentosa Development Corporation's (SDC) consideration in this less intrusive accommodation option. I also appreciate that SDC carried out stakeholder engagements and I would be keen to understand what environmental and safety considerations are required of the operator and whether any of the suggestions during consultation have been adopted.

2023-03-20-T-021,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"I have some further questions. First, on zoning. Given that the Southern Islands are near marine and coastal areas, was an EIA conducted to understand and mitigate potential impact of the new development such as Tiny Homes on the area? How does the coastal and ecological profiling exercise by URA inform development in the Southern Islands?",21,1322,2023-03-20-T-021-S-01322

2023-03-20-T-021,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, on carrying capacity. With increasing developments on the island, more Singaporeans and tourists are visiting. Has there been any research to estimate the carrying capacity of the islands and are there limits or caps to the number of visitors on the island at any one point? In nature areas such as Kranji Marshes, permits for large groups are required for similar reasons.

Where new areas, such as Tengah, are being developed to provide housing, there is also the need to launch a sufficient quantum of flats to provide the critical mass to ensure viability of new facilities, for example, shops, and major infrastructure, such as rail lines.",1,1577,2023-03-20-T-077-S-01577
2023-03-20-T-077,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the recent February 2023 BTO launch, HDB offered about 4,400 flats in four towns comprising a mix of non-mature and mature estates of Jurong West, Tengah, Kallang Whampoa and Queenstown. HDB will offer about 5,400 BTO flats in Tengah, Bedok, Kallang Whampoa and Serangoon in May 2023.",2,1578,2023-03-20-T-077-S-01578

2023-03-20-T-078,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the dollar amount that is deemed as a budget meal under the new lease renewal requirements for HDB rental coffee shops; and (b) in view of the new requirement to provide four budget meals spread across different stalls, what is the motivation behind the decision to reduce the number of meals from six to four.",1,1580,2023-03-20-T-078-S-01580
2023-03-20-T-078,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The price of the budget meal is proposed by the operator and reviewed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to ensure they are reasonable and remain affordable in reference to nearby options. This strikes a balance between the operator’s business sustainability and the needs of residents for affordable food options. Rental coffee shops leased under the Price-Quality Method tenders typically provide budget food options with prices at around $3 to $3.50 across the estates.,1,1581,2023-03-20-T-078-S-01581
2023-03-20-T-078,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Existing coffee shop operators who successfully tendered to rent their coffee shops under the Price-Quality Method will continue to provide six budget meals and one budget drink, as stipulated in the conditions of their original tender bids. However, operators of coffee shops who did not tender to rent their coffee shops under the Price-Quality Method will require time to make the transition with their stallholders. Hence, we will only require them to provide four budget meals and two drinks as a condition for the renewal of the coffee shop tenancy, until further review.",2,1582,2023-03-20-T-078-S-01582
2023-03-20-T-078,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To further ease the transition for operators and stallholders to offer the budget meals, HDB is offering them a 5% discount on the renewal rents for a period of one year.",3,1583,2023-03-20-T-078-S-01583

2023-03-20-T-080,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Only Singapore residents can apply for jobs on the MyCareersFuture (MCF) portal. MCF serves both unemployed individuals looking for a job as well as employed individuals looking for a new job. The majority of users are employed.,1,1589,2023-03-20-T-080-S-01589
2023-03-20-T-080,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"From 2020 to 2022, an average of 112,600 vacancies was posted on MCF daily.

2023-03-20-T-080,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Hence, we should look more holistically at the proportion of active MCF users who have found jobs, as it reflects the outcomes of their job search across all channels. From 2020 to 2021, on average, there have been about 240,000 active local MCF users each year, of which about half found new jobs within six months. Of those who did not find new jobs within six months, close to eight in 10 were already employed at point of application.",5,1593,2023-03-20-T-080-S-01593
