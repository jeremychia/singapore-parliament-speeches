2023-03-22-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the adequacy of the supply of school bus services; (b) whether an update on the same can be provided specifically for Special Education schools; and (c) what is the average increase in school bus fares seen in 2022.,1,1,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00001
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been monitoring the provision of school bus services. The demand for school bus services has been relatively stable, as we continue to have 98% of our Primary 1 students able to obtain a place either in a primary school of their choice or within two kilometres of their residence.",1,2,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00002
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"However, based on our engagement with some school bus service providers, they have provided feedback on a shortage of bus drivers, with the post-COVID-19 reopening of the economy being a factor. This was also compounded by the rising fuel prices which have affected the viability of some of these providers.",2,3,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00003
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Despite these challenges, most providers have continued providing school bus services, but have to raise their fares to reflect both rising costs and the need for the industry to attract and retain sufficient school bus drivers. These are issues which MOE is engaging the relevant stakeholders to address.",3,4,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00004
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"For most MOE schools, the bus fares have gone up by up to 10% in 2023 compared to 2022, while special education (SPED) schools have generally seen a higher increase due to the smaller pool of bus operators who are able to meet their more complex needs.",4,5,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00005
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"To better ensure affordability of transport costs to school for lower-income students, MOE has enhanced the school bus subsidy from 60% of monthly school bus fares to 65% since January 2023. This will reduce the amount paid by the families of these needy students and help mitigate the increase in school bus fares. Beyond that, in situations where the family needs more help, the schools are able to provide more financial assistance to cover the school bus fares.",5,6,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00006
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Likewise, for SPED schools, eligible students taking school bus services can apply for the Enabling Transport Subsidy (ETS), administered by SG Enable, which was increased from 1 July 2022 to help defray the cost of school bus fares. Beyond that, the SPED schools are able to provide further discretionary support to needy students who may need additional help with their school bus fares.",6,7,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00007
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Both the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and MOE will continue to closely monitor the school bus fare situation, and if need be, step up financial support for needy students who have to travel by school bus.",7,8,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00008
2023-03-22-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Perera.,1,9,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00009
2023-03-22-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister of State for her answer. Just two supplementary questions. My understanding of the school bus operator population is that – and I will stand corrected if this is not not borne out by the facts – but my understanding is that it is an ageing population and many of these operators are set up as sole proprietorships. They may employ a very small number of people, may drive the buses themselves. Over time, we can expect that there will be exits from the industry.",1,10,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00010
2023-03-22-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Is the Ministry looking at how to address that? Because as the population ages, there could be certain solutions that we need to look at. For example, facilitating these micro businesses to to sell their business to a more organised operator – I just mentioned that as one possibility.",2,11,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00011
2023-03-22-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My second supplementary question is on the school bus services for SPED schools. I wanted to ask what sort of training is made available to the bus operators for SPED schools, given the complexity that is involved in that, which is different from just operating a bus for mainstream schools. Sometimes, there could be certain types of skills that they need to have in order to do their job effectively. I have encountered one issue with one of my constituents in the Serangoon ward of the Aljunied Group Representative Constituency (GRC). So, I am wondering what sort of training is given to these bus operators.",3,12,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00012
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. Indeed, the school bus industry is quite a fragmented one, with many sole proprietors. We at MOE ourselves are also beginning to learn about this industry and we are in discussion with other agencies. We are starting to engage the school bus operators to see what kind of help we can provide to facilitate this industry to stay viable in the long term and to support the needs of our students for school bus services.",1,13,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00013
2023-03-22-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"As to the training, MOE does not provide training to the school bus operators of SPED schools. Instead, what our schools normally do is specify in the contracts what kind of skills and services we require the school bus operators to be equipped with, either for the drivers or the minders in the buses.",2,14,2023-03-22-T-001-S-00014
2023-03-22-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Transport what are the steps the Ministry has taken to work with hospitals in increasing access to the use of infant car seats.,1,15,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00015
2023-03-22-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, please allow me, on behalf of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and PUB, to wish everybody a Happy Water Day.",1,16,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00016
2023-03-22-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Now, back to the Ministry of Transport (MOT). Sir, the requirement for the use of appropriate child restraints in private vehicles, such as infant car seats, is a long-standing one which parents are generally aware of.",2,17,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00017
2023-03-22-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),A range of child restraint solutions are available in the market. We have no plans to work with hospitals to further increase access to the use of infant car seats.,3,18,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00018
2023-03-22-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.,1,19,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00019
2023-03-22-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. In my Adjournment Motion about a year ago, I had raised this as a recommendation for MOT to work with the hospitals to increase access and use of infant car seats. I believe the Senior Parliamentary Secretary replied in his speech that this is a new idea that he would share with relevant agencies and stakeholders.",1,20,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00020
2023-03-22-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"So, one, could I ask whether this recommendation has been shared the relevant stakeholders and the relevant agencies as well? And two whether the recommendations I proposed have been looked into, which included I believe the hospitals to include in their prenatal class, the use of infant car seats, the provision of infant car seats to parents who upon discharge do not have one, even including into the bill. I believe the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said all this will be looked into.",2,21,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00021
2023-03-22-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Yes, indeed, we did look into it. And since then, we have checked with the agencies to understand that currently the Traffic Police (TP) has partnered KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH)  to educate the public on road safety, including road safety for child passengers. For example, TP provided input for KKH's educational collaterals on the use of use of child car seats. Such collaborations have been increasing awareness among parents, especially new parents, about the requirements for child restraints and their correct use.",1,22,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00022
2023-03-22-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,These current arrangements already are helping parents and we know many parents are concerned about the safety of their children.,2,23,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00023
2023-03-22-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As for the Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH's budget subsidises healthcare with the aim of ensuring that basic healthcare remains affordable and accessible for the general population. This includes healthcare services, drugs, devices and various therapeutics and medical technology. Infant car seats are not within the scope of healthcare subsidies.",3,24,2023-03-22-T-002-S-00024
2023-03-22-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Government envisions a larger role for Singapore in realising the ASEAN Power Grid; and (b) whether the Government is considering direct investments in renewable and sustainable cross-border electricity infrastructure to ensure electricity sustainability.,1,25,2023-03-22-T-003-S-00025
2023-03-22-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),The ASEAN Power Grid is ASEAN’s vision to integrate the national power systems of its 10 member states. This will create opportunities for mutual support and electricity trading among the member states. The support of all ASEAN member states is necessary to realise this vision. And Singapore is committed to playing our part.,1,26,2023-03-22-T-003-S-00026
2023-03-22-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Singapore has been working with various countries on pathfinder projects such as the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project. We have also signed several Memoranda of Understanding with like-minded countries such as Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam – and I think Members know, with Indonesia as well – to advance our collective energy interests and facilitate regional decarbonisation.",2,27,2023-03-22-T-003-S-00027
2023-03-22-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Last week, Indonesia and Singapore signed the MOU on Renewable Energy Cooperation where we will collaborate on cross-border electricity trading projects.",3,28,2023-03-22-T-003-S-00028
2023-03-22-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),We are also working with the US on a feasibility study on regional energy connectivity to support the development of the ASEAN Power Grid. The ASEAN Power Grid can facilitate ASEAN’s decarbonisation efforts. There is significant renewable energy potential in the Southeast Asia region. Building energy interconnections can help to realise this potential by joining the producing regions to the consumption points or regions.,4,29,2023-03-22-T-003-S-00029
2023-03-22-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"At this point in time, the Government does not intend to invest directly in cross-border infrastructure. Our focus is to work with regional partners to provide the framework, regulations as well as the ecosystem that will enable commercial players to build the infrastructure. We will continue to work closely with all of our regional partners and with this year’s ASEAN Chair, Indonesia, to realise the ASEAN Power Grid.",5,30,2023-03-22-T-003-S-00030
2023-03-22-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether having a mental health-related condition is a ground for being ineligible for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS); (b) if so, what is the rationale; and (c) what specific mental health-related conditions will prevent the take-up of HPS.",1,31,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00031
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) is a mortgage reducing insurance that protects CPF members and their families from losing their HDB flats in the event of the member’s death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability.",1,32,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00032
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Having a mental health-related condition is not necessarily a ground that would make a person ineligible for the HPS. Instead, a member’s eligibility for the HPS is assessed based on the overall severity, prognosis and control of the medical condition as well as their health risk profile.",2,33,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00033
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Hence, even for members with pre-existing mental health-related conditions, a majority of them are covered under the scheme because their conditions are assessed by medical professionals to be mild or moderate.",3,34,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00034
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Notwithstanding this, the HPS coverage is not extended to applicants with serious pre-existing medical conditions, including serious mental health-related conditions, if they are assessed to have significantly higher risk of mortality. Members of the House, this is in line with industry practice. This ensures the affordability of premiums for the majority of members as well as the viability of the scheme.",4,35,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00035
2023-03-22-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Perera.,1,36,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00036
2023-03-22-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, just to clarify my understanding of what he said, the relevant authorities will take a nuanced approach looking at the extent of the mental health condition and also the nature of the mental health condition – I think different types of conditions may have different implications in terms of behaviour and in terms of the propensity to do different things that could affect the actuarial basis of the scheme. So, just want to confirm the understanding that you would be looking at severity as well as the type of mental health conditions to decide on eligibility.",1,37,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00037
2023-03-22-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My second supplementary question is, when looking at these issues, does the Government take into consideration that whatever the actuarial science says about people with mental health conditions who go on to schemes like this, that data may have come about in the past when the extent of diagnosis of mental health conditions was maybe much, much less than what it is now and what it will be in the future, with growing awareness of mental health issues and as we move away from the stigmatisation and discrimination of people with mental health conditions, and you can expect that more people will be diagnosed – so, are we using data from the past in order to draw an actuarial conclusion about the present day? Is that taken into consideration as well?",2,38,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00038
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, I think to the first supplementary question, the answer is yes. We do take a nuanced approach; we depend on medical experts; we are certainly not the experts in determining what is the level of severity, the prognosis, to whether the actuarial risks associated with the mortality or morbidity as a result of a particular illness. So, we do take a nuanced approach, but it is based on advice from experts and medical experts, including psychiatric experts, if you talk about mental illness.",1,39,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00039
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"What we do need, however, is for the members at the point of signing, to disclose upfront the pre-existing conditions that they have. Because you can imagine and you can surmise or conclude that if you disclose it after the event and you have a pre-existing condition that you do not disclose upfront and if something then happens, after that for you then go back and have all that data, I think it would be very difficult for us to access that data.",2,40,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00040
2023-03-22-T-004,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the second supplementary question, in terms of the extent of the diagnosis, we constantly and continuously review the data that is available. And I think this is not something that is carved in stone in terms of the coverage. However, because of the fact that the HPS is constructed to be as widespread and as pervasive as possible to support the broadest segment of our population in their home protection – for them to be able to continue to cover the loans in the event of total permanent disability and so on and so forth – we also want to keep the scheme sustainable and affordable. Hence, the approach is a very balanced, very measured and a calibrated one. I hope that addresses your query.",3,41,2023-03-22-T-004-S-00041
2023-03-22-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry is working with research centres in Singapore to pilot, promote and expand the use of productivity-enhancing technologies by care providers; (b) what is the budget that the Ministry provides annually for research and roll-out in this area; and (c) what are the measures of the impact and sustainability of these innovative technologies in terms of how they will improve caregiving or relieve human caregiving.",1,42,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00042
2023-03-22-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, there are several efforts to encourage the use of technology to enhance care. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025) programme, the $90 million Population Health Research Grant supports projects that seek to improve health outcomes through a population health approach, including projects that aim to optimise resource allocation, improve healthcare manpower productivity and leverage technology to improve health.",1,43,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00043
2023-03-22-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),The $18 million Community Care Digital Transformation Plan supports CCOs to adopt a comprehensive suite of digital solutions that help to raise digitalisation levels and improve productivity.,2,44,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00044
2023-03-22-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"In addition, the National Innovation Challenge (NIC) on Active and Confident Ageing had awarded close to $70 million to 35 research projects to address the needs of seniors or improve productivity of care staff. One example is a web-based system integrating technology to enhance care at home, including the use of smart home sensors to detect falls, automated pill dispensers to track medication adherence and  a nutrition database that recommends meals based on the senior's health condition. Another used artificial intelligence to provide personalised educational resources and care triage services to caregivers. Each project is measured for their impact, with a view to scale them up if proven to be effective.",3,45,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00045
2023-03-22-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Dennis Tan.,1,46,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00046
2023-03-22-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. Just one clarification. Does the Government think that it should increase its resources, to allocate more resources to develop more and better technologies to better assist caregivers in their everyday roles?",1,47,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00047
2023-03-22-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the answer is yes. Not all of the resource allocation is tagged specifically to digitalisation or care or elderly. There is great overlap in many of the projects  something that applies to acute care may well have an impact on elderly care; something that applies within the hospital may have an impact on the community; something which is labelled as a productivity improvement may indeed rest on digitalisation.",1,48,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00048
2023-03-22-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I think we do need to look at the overall effect of our various efforts to improve care, improve productivity, improve the effectiveness of our interventions and, where appropriate, use technology.",2,49,2023-03-22-T-005-S-00049
2023-03-22-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Transport in the last three years (a) how many applications for the (i) Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (ii) Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (iii) Bus Driver's Vocational Licence (iv) Bus Attendant's Vocational Licence and (v) Omnibus Driver's Vocational Licence were rejected due to the criminal record of the applicants for offences other than rape, murder or kidnapping respectively; and (b) of these, how many appeals were received and how many were approved upon appeal.",1,50,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00050
2023-03-22-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"Of the more than 15,000 vocational licence or VL applications across the different services in 2022, 226 applications or about 1.5% were rejected due to criminal records, including murder, rape and kidnapping.",1,51,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00051
2023-03-22-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"It is necessary for LTA to screen the VL applications to safeguard the interests of the commuting public. LTA may consider appeals from applicants with criminal records depending on the nature of the case. In 2022, 72 out of these 169 appeals were acceded to. LTA considers such appeals carefully to strike a balance between allowing applicants who committed less severe offences to take on driving as a vocation while safeguarding the safety of passengers.",2,52,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00052
2023-03-22-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.,1,53,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00053
2023-03-22-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. I understand that those who have committed offences like rape, murder and kidnapping will not get a licence. And I think that is a reasonable safeguard for passengers.",1,54,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00054
2023-03-22-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"However, I have met residents who told me they cannot get back their vocational licence for past convictions for less violent or non-violent offences. This prevents them from earning a living and re-integrating into society.",2,55,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00055
2023-03-22-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"So, can the Senior Minister of State please provide more clarity on what offences will debar a person from obtaining this licence? I think this will also give some clarity to the passengers to know that drivers who have gotten offences in the past will not be a safety threat to themselves.",3,56,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00056
2023-03-22-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As the Member has rightly pointed out, we need to strike a balance, we need to maintain public confidence, especially for passengers conveyed in public service vehicles, like taxis and private hire cars (PHCs). Whilst we want to give the applicant who has had a criminal record before a second chance in taking up driving as a vocation, we also need to ensure that the interest and safety of  commuters  are safeguarded.",1,57,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00057
2023-03-22-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, when we look at the applications, the Member has asked whether there are specific offences that we consider. Actually, criminal offences make up a large range. Besides murder, rape and kidnapping, there is a real wide range of such offences. We will consider them on a case-by-case basis because it is not just the severity of the offence, but also when the offence was committed and also any other mitigating factors like recalcitrance and so on.",2,58,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00058
2023-03-22-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, when an appeal comes in, we will look at it on a case-by-case basis, based on its own merit and make an independent assessment.",3,59,2023-03-22-T-006-S-00059
2023-03-22-T-007,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Health what is the annual number and percentage of (i) childcare centres and (ii) kindergartens affected by Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease for each year in the past five years.",1,60,2023-03-22-T-007-S-00060

HFMD is common during childhood and it is not unusual to have HFMD cases or clusters of two or more cases in preschools. Based on data from 2018 to 2022, the annual number of preschools with HFMD clusters ranged from 352 to 1,073 for childcare centres and 34 to 152 for kindergartens, accounting for about 23% to 66% of childcare centres and 11% to 37% of kindergartens.",2,62,2023-03-22-T-007-S-00062

Although the numbers of reported clusters had increased in 2022, it is too soon to determine whether this reflects a rising trend beyond that seen in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.",3,63,2023-03-22-T-007-S-00063

Can I just confirm, one, that MOH is able to close preschools, I believe for up to 10 days, to be able to break the chain of infections of HFMD? And two, what support the Ministry will provide to parents during these closures who have no alternative childcare arrangements?",1,65,2023-03-22-T-007-S-00065

Closure of preschools is only one of the strategies and one of the tools when an outbreak occurs of HFMD or other mild, self-limiting, low severity diseases which are common in the community. The key to controlling spread is through early detection, isolation, maintaining high standards of personal and environmental hygiene – washing hands, covering the mouth and nose, avoiding sharing food and drinks or personal items.",1,66,2023-03-22-T-007-S-00066

So, I was wondering in context of that, would the Senior Minister of State Mr Zaqy be able to share more? How are we helping workers be aware and to protect themselves?",2,75,2023-03-22-T-008-S-00075
2023-03-22-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his questions. I think for most employees, they know their general rights. If something amiss comes about, where you are terminated unfairly, you can always come to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) or one of the unions, especially for those under Progressive Wage, where most are pretty much covered by the unions.",1,76,2023-03-22-T-008-S-00076
2023-03-22-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"As far as we know, today, neither MOM nor any of our lead sector agencies have received any complaints with regard to termination and being converted to be self employees. So, I think in a tight labour market, as I have explained, one who is unfairly terminated and being asked to come back as a platform worker, for example, I think that is unfair. But they do have choices too to work for someone else. Certainly, for the the employer, it is not too wise to do so, in a sense that once you are self-employed, you can serve multiple employees too. So, then, therefore, the employer loses the worker as well.",2,77,2023-03-22-T-008-S-00077

So, if you have not issued him a written order, then your process has a problem. And you do not have the right to say that he has absconded.",2,134,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00134
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,That is not the question I asked. I take it that the Member does not wish to say whether Mr Lee Hsien Yang will come back and cooperate with the authorities.,1,135,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00135
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And, Sir, there is nothing flawed with the process. Police have explained the process and I repeat, both in this House and I am prepared to repeat it outside, Mr Lee Hsien Yang has absconded, on the facts. That is my position. That is consistent with what Mr Lee Hsien Yang himself has said, that he is a fugitive. And you have seen the dictionary definitions.",2,136,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00136
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, let us not engage in false rhetoric. I will carry on with my Ministerial Statement.",3,137,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00137
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Everyone, including Mr Leong, knows that they have left the country, that they are ""fugitives"" and they have told the media they are not returning to Singapore. They have absconded.",4,138,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00138
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, let us not hide behind a smoke screen of whether or not a Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) order was issued. They were asked to cooperate and they have run away. And you can say they have absconded, when they themselves know they are ""fugitives"".",5,139,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00139
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,That deals with the two main points I have made.,6,140,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00140
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Let me now move on to the Keppel & Offshore Marine (KOM) matter which Member has posted about.,7,141,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00141
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I told the Member on Monday, I had explained the differences between KOM and the case involving Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern, and why they are different. I had also explained in my answer on 20 March, why in some circumstances when some names are disclosed in legal proceedings, nevertheless, Police may not release the names here. I invited him to point out so we can discuss which area of my explanation he does not understand or disagrees with. He did not respond.",8,142,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00142
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me address a fundamental point arising from what he said on Monday. He said there are double standards because the individuals in the KOM case are, I quote his words, ""actually guilty"". Sir, the Member has Parliamentary Privilege to speak, but that has to be exercised responsibly. When we want to say that someone is ""guilty"", I would like to remind all Members to have a care.",9,143,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00143
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong has said that persons investigated by CPIB are, I quote, ""actually guilty"". That is making assertions against a number of persons, that they are guilty of criminal offences, that they have been found guilty of criminal offences, when in fact, they have not been found guilty. Not all the persons. The Cambridge dictionary definition of ""guilty"" is ""responsible for breaking a law"".",10,144,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00144
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, Sir, I will now invite Mr Leong, through you, to either substantiate his statement, that they are all guilty, or withdraw his statement. One cannot, under the cloak of Parliamentary Privilege, make these sorts of statements about people. And if he does not withdraw, then Sir, we will consider what else needs to be done.",11,145,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00145

2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker, may I ask the Minister? I actually was the first to raise the issue that whether the Senior Minister and Minister should make such statements in this Parliament. And now, he is turning it around and says that I have made certain statement.",1,147,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00147
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But I will answer his question first and I hope he answers the question I will ask, fully, later.",2,148,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00148
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"When I say these individuals are guilty, because this is based on the information that we have obtained about what happened overseas, in the overseas jurisdiction. What the Singapore Court's decision is, we know that the CPIB decided not to prosecute them.",3,149,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00149
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But at the same time, we also want to know not to prosecute, does it also mean that in the stern warning letter, there is really —when a stern warning letter is issued, does it mean that there are actually sufficient evidence to show that they are guilty, but there are some reasons that the CPIB decide not to prosecute them?",4,150,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00150
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I raise a point of order. I had asked a simple question. Is the Member saying they have been found guilty, all of them, in any court of law? Or is he otherwise prepared to withdraw his statement? That is all I have asked. If he says he is not prepared to withdraw, we leave it and we follow up.",1,151,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00151
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I have the impression that they are found guilty in the overseas court of law.,1,152,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00152
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Can I know what is the basis on which the Member says that he is under that impression; that they have all been found guilty?,1,153,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00153
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,This is based on the case; the case has been such a big case overseas and in Singapore. And the Keppel Corp has paid such a big fine overseas.,1,154,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00154
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Can I suggest that Member works a little bit, finds out what he is talking about, before coming here and making serious allegations? If I were to tell him that his statement is false, it is untrue to say that they have all been found guilty elsewhere, certainly not in Singapore, is he prepared to withdraw his statement?",1,155,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00155
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker, if the Minister said that they have not been found guilty overseas, then I am prepared to withdraw my statement.",1,156,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00156
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Well, for the record, one person pleaded guilty in the United States. To the best of my knowledge, no one else has been found guilty. And it is a very serious statement to come here, make allegations without doing your homework and then propagate this sort of stuff – all over the place; really unparliamentary and not acceptable. And then to say, ""Well, I have read"", ""It seems to be big"".",1,157,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00157
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Unfortunately, this is a thread running through all of Mr Leong's statements. He does not do his homework. He does not check. He just says all sorts of things. And that is not the way debates ought to go. I am glad Mr Leong has withdrawn that statement.",2,158,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00158
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Next, and therefore the basis on which Mr Leong says, ""Oh, you know it is similar to this case"", it is not there. And I had given various other reasons why there are differences. He never dealt with any of them.",3,159,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00159
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Next, Parti Liyani. Sir, Mr Leong said that my referring to Parti Liyani is an attempt to muddy the waters because the case is irrelevant. The Member has ascribed an improper motive to me. The essence of his statement is that I used an example which is irrelevant and that it was used to confuse Parliament. If that is what he thought, if he had said it, I would have responded immediately.",4,160,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00160
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, let me make this clear. We have no problem, I certainly have no problem with Members challenging me, debating. The tougher the debate, the better it is, because the public then gets a better sense of which opinion is better or where the facts are. So, we welcome debate. We want debate.",5,161,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00161
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But when a statement is made in Parliament and the Member does not respond; and then goes out, and particularly when I said is there anything that you disagree with or you do not understand, and he keeps quiet. He keeps quiet and then goes out and says this.",6,162,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00162
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I explained why the Parti Liyani case is relevant. It is an illustration of a fairly similar case where we also released the identity of a person who was being investigated and where the Member was present and did not object.,7,163,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00163
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, Sir, again, I will have to trouble you. I seek a clarification from Mr Leong, through you. Why does he say the Parti Liyani case is not relevant?",8,164,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00164
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker. First of all, I want to clarify, in my opinion, that even in our debate in this House, it is not necessary that all the time we have enough time and opportunities to refute every point. How long have we lasted —",1,165,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00165

2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, just one point.",1,167,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00167
2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Point of order. Is he saying I am not telling the truth when I invited Members to respond to me? If he disagrees —,1,168,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00168

2023-03-22-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong,  if I recall, questions were asked, you did not respond. You had every opportunity. If you had raised your hands to respond, the time would have been given to you to do that.",1,178,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00178
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Well, Speaker, you have a very good memory. But okay, I will answer —",1,179,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00179
2023-03-22-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Maybe just to clarify. Would that be a correct description? The question was asked. You did not respond to it.,1,180,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00180
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,It is not totally true. I think —,1,181,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00181
2023-03-22-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"So, you did respond to the question?",1,182,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00182
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I had the opportunity to talk two times. But I wanted a third time to talk. But before I could —,1,183,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00183

2023-03-22-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I specifically asked and I do not recall the Member raising his hands. We can look at the video because these things are on video now. I give an opportunity to the Member to correct himself. It would be accurate to say that we asked and Member did not respond. Would the Member agree, Sir?",1,187,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00187
2023-03-22-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"And if I may add, Mr Leong, are you alleging that I did not give you the time to respond? Are you saying that?",1,188,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00188

2023-03-22-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"No, no. I am asking a question. Because the questions were asked; I was watching whether you had responses. You did not raise your hands further. Would that be fair? Because I think I need to clarify for myself. Are you alleging that I am not permitting you the space to respond?",1,190,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00190
2023-03-22-T-009,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Well, Speaker, sometimes, when we are debating an issue like this, it needs time to digest. Sometimes, it may take a bit of time to respond. But when the process just moves through so fast, there will be —",1,191,2023-03-22-T-009-S-00191

2023-03-22-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is a point that I have been stressing repeatedly. It is on the expansion of the disposable carrier bag charge to more, if not all, retail businesses.",4,374,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00374
2023-03-22-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We currently only apply the charge to large supermarkets because they have the resources to implement it.

2023-03-22-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Senior Minister of State at least provide a five-year roadmap for the expansion of the disposable bag charge?

2023-03-22-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on applying the charge to online purchases. Increasingly common are ""click and collect"" purchases, where customers shop online and collect their products at a physical store. Since products are bought in advance, customers can make plans to bring their own reusable bags to collect their purchases.",7,377,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00377

Under the scheme, customers have to pay a small deposit for certain pre-packaged drinks, which will be refunded when they return the container for recycling. This will encourage consumers to return beverage containers and increase their recycling rate. However, this may erode the income of those who collect cans for a living. These individuals are often low-income and elderly. Can the Senior Minister of State share if we have studied how the scheme will impact their livelihoods? If so, what additional support will be extended to them?",10,380,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00380

This proposed law will help allay concerns about liability issues from the donation of food. It will help reduce food waste further and also provide food for the hungry.

Countries, such as Kenya, Rwanda and our neighbouring Thailand, have introduced stringent rules on the production and usage of plastic bags. Kenya, in particular, has implemented what has been called ""the world's strictest plastic ban"" and banned all single-use plastic bags throughout the country. Three years after they did so, some of their national parks began disallowing all single-use plastics on the premises. Although they did this primarily to tackle the littering problem, they have also successfully reduced plastic waste.",1,399,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00399

Does this charge apply to convenience stores like Cheers and 7-Eleven, which are related to the NTUC Fairprice and Dairy Farm groups respectively?",3,453,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00453
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"May I clarify, for online orders of groceries by these supermarkets, would the charge also apply to the deliveries made? Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.",4,454,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00454
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] About 80% of our residents' households live in HDB and about 16% in condominiums. It is a habit for Singaporeans to put their rubbish into plastic bags before throwing them down the rubbish chutes.,5,455,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00455
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I am concerned that residents will proceed to buy more plastic bags, which may be cheaper than five cents per piece if they buy in bulk. Unfortunately, there seems to be no better material than plastic to bag wet and perishable products.",6,456,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00456
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  I am also concerned that reusable plastic bags, which shoppers are encouraged to bring along, may not be environmentally friendlier if the frequency of usage is low.",7,457,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00457
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, regarding the beverage container return scheme, does the scheme operator have the flexibility or room to exercise creativity to entice consumers to recycle plastic bottles and metal cans, such as by refunding the deposits and topping up in the form of supermarket vouchers, in the event the scheme operators are partnering the supermarket chains, which have a better network of outreach so as to improve the recycling rate?",8,458,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00458
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),Would the Minister share what is the average return rate in other countries which had introduced this scheme earlier than Singapore?,9,459,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00459
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I would also like to ask how much space does a single returning point take up, and what would be the estimated monthly cost to operate a returning point? How will the Ministry ascertain the success of this scheme? Will the scheme be funded by taxpayers' money? Are there any Government grants that the beverage producers can tap upon to minimise producer fees which may be passed on to consumers eventually?",10,460,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00460
2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),I am worried that consumers will likely end up paying more if the recycled material value is lower than the cost of joining and complying with the licensed scheme. The other concern would be over people fighting over used metal cans and plastic bottles at F&B joints or rubbish collection points.,11,461,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00461

2023-03-22-T-010,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),I would like to ask about food manufacturers which also have food catering businesses. May I propose that the food caterers be required to report the leftover food items brought back to their factories as food waste too? Would the Ministry consider penalising food caterers who dump the food waste at clients' places instead of bringing it back to the factories? Are food waste generators required to report the amount of food waste periodically? What are the disclosure requirements?,13,463,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00463

I am glad that many Members have expressed support for the bag charge, including Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Louis Ng. Indeed, many Members, including Miss Cheng Li Hui, former Member of Parliament, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) like Zero Waste SG and WWF Singapore have also called for a charge on disposable bags.

The Government has been studying the experiences of other jurisdictions that have implemented a bag charge. We are also mindful of our local circumstances, where plastic bags are widely used by households to dispose of waste hygienically and where incinerable waste is not directly landfilled. We convened the Citizens' Workgroup in 2020 to tap into diverse views and insights to address the issues of disposables. After we accepted the recommendation to implement a disposable carrier bag charge, we consulted widely to hear different considerations, seek feedback and build collective support.",3,467,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00467

2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Compared to other retail establishments, shoppers tend to make larger purchases at supermarkets and may have to purchase more bags if they forget or do not bring enough reusable bags. We have therefore set the bag charge at a minimum of five cents and most covered supermarket operators will be charging five cents per bag when the bag charge comes into effect. The bag charge can be avoided by bringing our own bags. We all have to play our part for the environment.",6,470,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00470

Covered supermarket operators have flexibility to decide on the use of proceeds but will need to account to the public for how they were used. Our approach to mandate annual declarations on the use of proceeds ensures that there is transparency and public accountability, while minimising regulatory and compliance costs. I am heartened that all the supermarket operators have indicated that they intend to use the proceeds to support environmental and social causes.",7,471,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00471
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan asked about expansion plans for the bag charge. We will monitor the effectiveness of the bag charge and assess the need to expand coverage. For example, will we observe new behavioural norms where bringing your own bag for shopping becomes second nature? Will more retailers follow suit to voluntarily charge for disposable carrier bags? We can learn from the experience of other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and England, which have taken a phased approach in extending the coverage of the bag charge over time.",8,472,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00472

As I said in my opening speech, operators of Singapore Food Agency (SFA)-licensed supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $100 million will be required to charge for disposable carrier bags at their SFA-licensed supermarket outlets. Convenience stores, such as those operated by Cheers and 7-Eleven that do not sell or prepare raw meats, poultry or seafood, are not required to have supermarket licences and hence do not come under this legislation. Nonetheless, I note that Cheers and 7-Eleven are already charging for disposable carrier bags voluntarily.",9,473,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00473
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),Members have raised clarifications about online grocery purchases. We will prescribe in the subsidiary legislation that the bag charge will not apply to disposable carrier bags used by retailers to bag groceries that are purchased online and delivered to the customer. This is because customers do not have the choice of using their own bags.,10,474,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00474
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Nevertheless, we agree with Ms Carrie Tan that there is scope for online retailers and platforms, not just supermarkets, to reduce packaging waste. We will study how best to address packaging waste from e-commerce, including online grocery shopping, as we develop the extended producer responsibility scheme for packaging waste management. In the meantime, we will work with the supermarket operators to compile best practices and develop guidelines on reducing packaging for online purchases.

We are not imposing a ban on disposable carrier bags. They will still be available. Other packaging such as the bags that hold bread or toilet rolls can also be used to bag waste as alternatives to supermarket carrier bags.",13,477,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00477
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"The bag charge should not be an excuse to dispose of waste in an irresponsible manner. Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Don Wee commented that with the bag charge, consumers might start purchasing single-use plastic bags from online and overseas retailers in bulk.

Setting up a convenient return point network is a top priority, because it is crucial to the scheme's success. The mandated return points in larger supermarkets will form an important part of the network. At other community spaces and public areas, NEA will work with the scheme operator to encourage premises operators to voluntarily set up return points. Based on the experience overseas, setting up a return point can increase footfall to stores. The scheme operator will also pay handling fees to return point operators as part of the commercial arrangement, to reimburse costs incurred.",20,484,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00484

2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Mr Don Wee asked about the space taken up by a return point. This would depend on whether the premises operator opts for an over-the-counter return point, or a reverse vending machine. Reverse vending machines, or RVMs, range in size, with smaller machines requiring around 0.6 square metres of space and larger ones with higher capacities requiring up to three square meters. Premises operators may work with the scheme operator to determine the optimal RVM size for their premises.",22,486,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00486
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Mr Don Wee asked whether the scheme operator can exercise creativity in boosting recycling rates, such as by offering supermarket vouchers. Return point operators would need to provide a full refund of the deposit amount when the covered beverage container is returned. As highlighted in my opening speech, the 10-cent deposit has been set to provide the necessary behavioural nudge to achieve the desired return rates. That said, we will certainly encourage the scheme operator to work with stakeholders such as return point operators to explore innovative ways to boost return rates.",23,487,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00487

We see such practices in overseas jurisdictions too. For example, in Australia, consumers are given the option to donate their refunds directly to charity. Beyond this, return point operators may also work with the scheme operator on further promotional initiatives to increase footfall to their stores, if they wish to.",24,488,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00488

This is an Extended Producer Responsibility, or EPR, scheme, where producers are responsible for the collection and recycling of their products. As such, the scheme would be financed by producers, that is, the covered beverage importers and manufacturers. Producers will pay producer fees to the scheme operator to carry out these responsibilities on their behalf.",25,489,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00489

The revenue from the sale of clean, high-quality and high-value recyclables will be utilised by the scheme operator to reduce the scheme costs. The eventual cost pass-through to consumers in beverage prices, if any, will likely be moderated by price competition among industry players.

2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"NEA will not determine which off-site treatment facility building managers should send their food waste to. Building managers can determine this based on their business considerations and submit their proposal for NEA's approval. Our intent is to encourage higher value-added processes, such as valorising food by-products into animal feed ingredients or even food products. More details on the approval criteria will be provided when ready. The food waste must be transported by licensed general waste collectors in a manner that safeguards public health.",48,512,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00512

2023-03-22-T-010,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just one clarification for Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. As we know, the plastic bag charge scheme will start with the larger supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $100 million.",1,524,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00524
2023-03-22-T-010,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I just wanted to ask for the Government's position on the retailers who are not currently covered by this $100 million point. If they would voluntarily want to impose a plastic bag charge and if, for example, they are going to charge more than what the supermarkets are going to charge, what is the Government's position on this and what is the recourse that Singaporeans may have if they feel that this may come up and this may amount to profiteering or something like that?",2,525,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00525
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Currently, there are already retailers who are voluntarily charging for bags and the bag charge actually varies. So, really, this is a commercial decision. It is also part of their sustainability drive if they are into this, and we will leave it to them, and the consumers have a choice of whether to patronise these retailers.",1,526,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00526
2023-03-22-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"What we have done is for the covered supermarkets, we have mandated a charge of at least five cents and, as I have said, most of the supermarkets that are covered will be charging five cents per bag. For us, we have mandated a low charge of five cents because we are also cognisant of the fact that most people get their disposable bags from the supermarket and if they shop in supermarkets, they tend to require more bags and, if they forget to bring their reusable bag, then they will have to pay for that.",2,527,2023-03-22-T-010-S-00527

2023-03-22-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people are afflicted with chronic rare diseases in Singapore. For the majority of this population, our national healthcare financing schemes, such as MediSave, MediShield Life and subsidies, provide financial assistance for treatments that this group of patients may require. Patients who face difficulty in affording their bills can also apply for MediFund through the public health institutions. For a small percentage, additional financial assistance may be required. The Rare Disease Fund (RDF) was set up to support high-cost medications for this group. Since its establishment in 2019, RDF has supported nine patients, which represents about 0.4% of Singaporeans with rare diseases.",1,538,2023-03-22-T-013-S-00538
2023-03-22-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Given the limited size of the RDF, funding support is focused on treatments for rare conditions that are life-threatening and where the treatment is effective in extending the patient’s lifespan. RDF lists new medications when it is able to attract donations to generate sufficient investment income to support patients who would, typically, require the medicines on a lifelong basis. Since its inception, RDF has expanded its funding support to cover seven medications for five conditions. RDF will continue to raise more donations and explore the coverage of more rare disease conditions. Donations attract three-for-one Government matching and enjoy tax deduction of 2.5 times the donation amount.",2,539,2023-03-22-T-013-S-00539
