2023-04-10-T-001,Halimah Yacob,The President (Mdm Halimah Yacob):,"Meritocracy has long been the organising principle of our society. It has provided opportunities to countless Singaporeans with the drive and ability to excel.

At the same time, we recognise the competitive stresses that have built up in our education system, especially amongst certain segments of society.

But let us not be unwittingly drawn into an educational arms race and end up worse off as a society.",28,30,2023-04-10-T-001-S-00030
2023-04-10-T-001,Halimah Yacob,The President (Mdm Halimah Yacob):,"We must also re-examine how society rewards different skills and talents and recognises the full range of pathways to success. We should accord greater value to those who are skilled with their hands and contribute through their technical and practical abilities, as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to excel in jobs, such as caregiving or community service. Every Singaporean must have the opportunity to take on work they find fulfilling and meaningful, build on their talents, give of their best and be rewarded fairly for it.",29,31,2023-04-10-T-001-S-00031
2023-04-10-T-001,Halimah Yacob,The President (Mdm Halimah Yacob):,"At the same time, we will step up support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable segments in our society. We will uplift lower-income workers and families, and empower them to take the initiative to improve their own lives.

2023-04-10-T-001,Halimah Yacob,The President (Mdm Halimah Yacob):,"For instance, employers must do their part to invest in their workers.
