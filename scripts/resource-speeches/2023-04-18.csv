2023-04-18-T-001,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"However, Mr Leong apologised to you in the Chamber very shortly thereafter.

2023-04-18-T-001,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, let me conclude by saying that none of these rules inhibit robust debate. Robust debate and a contest of ideas are expected. The rules are there to ensure the focus remains on making points of substance. Making false or unsubstantiated statements, or casting baseless aspersions, only serve to erode trust and undermine our democracy. Members should pay attention to the responses given and engage on the points that are made. When we do so, our people will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and trade-offs at play. It will also strengthen trust in our Parliament. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",5,19,2023-04-18-T-001-S-00019
2023-04-18-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I would like to thank Leader for her views. I agree with what has been shared. I have also noted Mr Leong Mun Wai’s apology at that Sitting for his discourteous remark on 22 March 2023.,1,20,2023-04-18-T-001-S-00020

2023-04-18-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The Chair is responsible for all 103 Members in this Chambers – everyone. While I appreciate that individuals are passionate about their causes and their views, I hope that Members show respect to the Chair and importantly, your fellow Members and do not act as if your views are all that matter. Because if everyone decides to insist on their own way, this will become a chaotic space like we see elsewhere. You have seen Speakers elsewhere shout and use the full range of their powers to discipline unruly members. I think we do not need to see this happening here; and thankfully, we are no where near there. Long may this remain so.",4,23,2023-04-18-T-001-S-00023
2023-04-18-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"While I have been permissive at times to facilitate the flow of debate, especially when it remains even-tempered and constructive, but as a rule, Members should address all remarks and requests to and through the Chair. Members should avoid addressing each other or to members of the public directly. While it may not make for a good show or theatre, this practice helps us all to remain cool, good-tempered and moderate during a debate. So, let us focus on the substance.",5,24,2023-04-18-T-001-S-00024
2023-04-18-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"We are all starting a new session and there is really a full agenda before the House. So, it is a useful opportunity for us to take stock of how we do business here. I expect Members to continue debating all issues robustly, to scrutinise and question policies and programmes thoroughly. I believe that we can do so while at the same time observing these fairly simple and reasonable rules. And importantly, to do so with decorum, courtesy and respect to each other here in this House.",6,25,2023-04-18-T-001-S-00025

These were points highlighted by President Halimah in her speech at the Opening of the second session of this 14th Parliament. But she reminded us that “we are far from powerless”. Our history and what we have achieved as a nation today has shown that our strength has and continues to be our people and our will as one people, government, businesses and citizens “working together to make the improbable possible”.",2,39,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00039
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"There are many important aspects that President Halimah has covered in her speech and plans that the Ministries have also outlined in the various addenda to her speech.

2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),It is heartening that MOE will invest more in preschool education especially for children from disadvantaged families. Studies have shown that access to quality childcare and early childhood education develops foundational skills and helps boost math and reading in children.,8,45,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00045
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"For our young, building strong foundational knowledge and skills including STEM is crucial. With rapid digitalisation, technology skills need to be part of core curriculum. With how technologies are evolving and the potential benefits and risks they pose, technology skills are essential not only to enable use and leverage of these technologies and tools. Equally important is the understanding of the pros and cons to enable discernment and appropriate use. For example, the benefits of ChatGPT, which everyone has been talking about. ChatGPT gives the ease of use with human-like conversations, extensive applications to produce text, images, music and code – to just name a few.",9,46,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00046

2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"There are both benefits and risks as AI and new technologies continue to play a bigger role in our work and lives. With increasing use of technologies, there are rising concerns around privacy, biases and discrimination. Policies are needed to protect, but with a balance so as not to impede the benefits to be derived from these technologies.

2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"As outlined in the MOE addendum, how teaching is done in our schools has evolved. An example is Subject-Based Banding which caters to the diverse interest and needs of students by allowing secondary school students to learn subjects based on their strengths and learning needs. To support our students to be able to collaborate and communicate effectively, schools will also need to continue to provide ample opportunity for students to do team-based learning around projects and problem solving.",15,52,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00052
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),These skills will train our students to collaborate with diverse groups and also require them to communicate effectively.

2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Let me now touch on those in the workforce. With people living longer and healthier, our workforce is multi-generational. The needs and experience of workers differ between generations in the workforce. This is an advantage if we are able to tap the diversity of the workforce. I have made this point in several of my speeches in this House that we need to rethink the structure of work to make learning and training systemic for workers of different age groups and stages of life. With change, people of all ages in the workforce will need to acquire knowledge at each stage of their careers and lives. Apart from work, workers have to manage their different obligations and life stages, hence learning has to be organised and accessible both online and hybrid-enabled access to learning to fit the learning needs and the different obligations, life stages and schedules of our workers.",17,54,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00054
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"COVID-19 has also brought fundamental changes and shown us the possibilities of how work can be organised and where work can be done. These can provide opportunities to attract and retain workers as well as tap a larger pool of talent. But to do so, will require fundamental shifts in mindsets and policies around work arrangements including flexible work arrangements and even retirement age.",18,55,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00055
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"President Halimah touched on the need for broader and a more open meritocracy to allow every Singaporean to have the opportunity to take on meaningful work that tap on their strengths and to be rewarded fairly for it. I feel that our schools, Institutions of Higher Learning and our SkillsFuture programmes, have and do provide pathways for learning, training, certification and credentials to recognise the skills acquired for our students and those in the workforce. What we need is for businesses and society to recognise skills, competencies and experiences of workers of all ages and qualifications, and not just academic levels of attainment for job opportunities and qualification.",19,56,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00056
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),Now let me touch on our society and the value of support for families. The family plays an important and central role in our society. The family provides our sense of belonging in society and are our first line of support and care.,20,57,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00057
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"With an aging population and people living longer, families are multi-generational and caregiving needs will increase. With smaller families, some families need to care for both the young and seniors.",21,58,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00058
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Mean-testing qualifying criteria for caregiving support for middle-income Singaporeans may work against some middle-income families that care for their family members.

2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Let me relate an example from a recent house visit I did. Our resident, Mdm Lee – not her real name – shared with me her worries on the long-term care needs for her brother. Mdm Lee and her husband are in their 60s and do not have children. They live in a terrace house with her brother, aged 65 years old, her sister who is in her 50s and an aged mother in her early 90s. The family are a close-knit family. Mdm Lee's brother suffered from poliomyelitis which affected his speech and mobility and he is unable to care for himself. In fact, during the COVID-19 period, it was really quite trying for this family in terms of caregiving needs.",23,60,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00060
2023-04-18-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Mdm Lee shared with me that the family do not qualify for any Government subsidies because of housing type. As her husband and her, and her siblings are either retired or nearing retirement, she is worried about affordability for her brother's long-term care when his condition gets worse and he needs to stay in a nursing home. Mdm Lee and her sister currently pay for his medical expenses as he does not have any medical insurance coverage. The irony is that if Mdm Lee's brother or mother did not live with Mdm Lee and lived in a HDB flat, her mother and brother would qualify for support for eldercare services and nursing home. But Mdm Lee and her family believe that staying together contributes to the overall well-being and care of their mother and brother.",24,61,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00061

I am not saying that we discount the means testing, I think that is required. But we need to think about the flexibility and also the circumstances and sometimes, we do it on a case-by-case basis. But as our population is ageing, I think we will have more and more of such scenarios.",25,62,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00062

2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"WHO notes that ageism can exist at three levels. First, at the institutional level, when laws, policies and social norms restrict or disadvantage individuals based on age. Second, ageism exists at the interpersonal level, in interactions between two or more individuals. Finally, ageism could be self-directed, when it is internalised by those who are discriminated, who then accept it and behave in ways that make it a self-fulling prophecy.",6,70,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00070
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, there is ageism everywhere, though we may not call it such by name. Here are some instances. One of my residents who is 97 and in excellent health, likes to go around asking anyone she meets in Teochew  ""I am 97 years old this year. Are you afraid of me?"" When we hear of someone so senior, some of us would, with good intentions, over-protect the person or assume that the person needs help, without stopping to think that everyone ages differently. We have also come across single elderly people who need to rent rooms to stay due to disagreements with their family but are rejected by landlords in view of their advanced age. Think also of the millions of dollars spent on hair dyes and anti-aging products, so as to present a younger image of ourselves for fear that we might otherwise not be taken seriously. There is also a sexist element to this, where professional men with grey hair are respected but women with grey hair doubted; but that deserves a more detailed discussion on another day.",7,71,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00071
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Ageist attitudes are also familiar in the workplace. How often do we hear of middle-aged job-seekers who report that once their age is revealed to the prospective employer, they would receive a polite response to wait for a follow-up call, which does not come? Indeed, in a survey released last March, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) confirmed that ageist attitudes were still prevalent in the Singapore workplace, affecting older workers.",8,72,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00072
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The recent global COVID-19 pandemic, too, saw ageism rear its ugly head. A United Nations independent expert, Dr Claudia Mahler, noted that the pandemic restrictions and lockdowns had resulted in a wave of ageist comments and hate speech; older persons were blamed as the reasons for lockdowns and labelled as vulnerable and burdens to societies.",9,73,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00073
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To combat ageism, the WHO highlights three strategies  first, through laws and policies; second, through public education and third, by increasing inter-generational contacts. How is Singapore doing in these aspects?",10,74,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00074
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"At the official or policy level, there are positives in Singapore. We see many health-related initiatives towards active ageing, including the latest Healthier SG initiative. The Government is also looking into more options for seniors to age in place instead of in an institution and for assisted living accommodation that preserves the individual's autonomy to make decisions. Such preservation of an individual's autonomy is a precious tenet that we can also see in legislation such as the Mental Capacity Act (MCA). Under the MCA, donees and deputies must give weight to the preferences of the incapacitated person as far as possible.",11,75,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00075
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"On the employment front, there are policies to incentivise employers to hire older workers through wage offset schemes such as the Senior Employment Credit. Nevertheless, for stronger protection for all workers, we are still eagerly awaiting the anti-discrimination legislation which the Prime Minister announced nearly two years ago. Apart from laws and policies, the other two strategies that are likely to have more impact are public education and increasing intergenerational contacts.",12,76,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00076

2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another aspect is to watch our public discourse, including debates in Parliament. Ministers and Members of Parliament should avoid making statements that may inadvertently perpetuate ageism, such as  ""By the year 2030, we will face a silver tsunami"", which evokes all the wrong images.",16,80,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00080
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As for increasing intergenerational contacts, I fully support HDB's move to evolve from building blocks with only senior apartments, to having mixed blocks of flats for seniors and flats owned by younger families. This provides opportunities for cross-generation neighbourly activities such as gardening, games and mutual care. Another Singapore initiative was cited positively by the WHO – that of pairing seniors from activity centres with young people to play video games together.",17,81,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00081
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Research has shown that the benefits of such intergenerational contacts go beyond reducing ageist attitudes; they also benefit older people in improved health and psychosocial well-being, reducing distress and loneliness.

2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Besides not restricting the areas for youth participation, we must also ask what sort of participation would convince our young people of a direct role in governance and policy-making. There is some indication that the many conversations so far conducted have led to conversation fatigue and skepticism. Cynicism about talking and consultations is understandable, as these are simply input which will eventually either be incorporated or thrown out by decision-makers.",26,90,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00090

2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Nevertheless, I believe one change that should be made is to give younger cohorts a direct say in our national elections by lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years. I raised this matter in this House 16 years ago and most recently again in this year’s Committee of Supply debates. The Government’s consistent response has been ""no"". This is despite Singapore being among a handful of countries in the world that has not reduced its voting age to 18 years, such as Bahrain, Cameroon, Tonga and the UAE. In the Government’s latest response this year, the Minister basically said that those between 18 and 21 years old do not have the skillsets required to cast their votes. I wonder how many citizens agree with this assessment.",28,92,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00092
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, it is worthwhile remembering that ageism can equally be directed against the young. To this end, it could be well be argued that when we require male Singaporeans to serve National Service at 18 years, but only permit them to vote at 21 years, this is a form of age-based discrimination.",29,93,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00093
2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As I said in February, in the 1960s, the movement in the United States to bring down the voting age to 18 years gained momentum when youths below 21 were drafted to fight in the Vietnam War.

2023-04-18-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, let me conclude. For Singapore to fully harness the energy of every citizen, we must foster a dynamic environment where ageist stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination are blown away. This is not something for the Government alone, but requires marshalling the whole-of-society. Each of us needs to examine ourselves too, to see how we individually can contribute to this endeavour in our everyday interactions.

2023-04-18-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We should not go down the route of an educational arms race. One key way to stop this is to reduce the syllabus. I am not saying it is the only way, but making the syllabus less voluminous will reduce the reliance on tuition to play catch-up. An educational arms race has incentivised a tuition culture. And if we do not stop the race now, our students are going to end up hitting a brick wall. We must avoid that. We must inject the joy of learning instead of reliance on tuition to play catch-up on the syllabus.",7,103,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00103

MOE's addendum to the President's Address, focuses on being able to better customise teaching and learning for students of differing abilities to bring out the best in each child. I believe one way this can be accomplished is to have a smaller class size to allow teachers to have more time with each student. This can lead to more individualised attention, a greater capacity to monitor each student's physical, mental and emotional well-being and the ability to tailor learning speeds and to cater to different learning styles.",9,105,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00105

The third part will suggest ""a Singapore model"" that can be a beacon for the region and also a bulwark against attempts by great powers to suborn or divide us.",6,129,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00129
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, on politics and political discourse. President Halimah's speech called for ""an active citizenry"" and ""a passionate civil society"". She also spoke of the importance of avoiding political polarisation and gridlock, having trust between ""our political leadership and people"" and keeping political discourse respectful and rational.",7,130,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00130
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Such calls are not new. But as I reflected on this, I found that my unease was captured in a public comment from former media editor and academic Bertha Henson. I will quote an excerpt here  ""I am always bemused when I hear politicians warning Singaporeans against such 'polarisation'. Our politics is nowhere as partisan. We do not have a two-party system yet nor a civil society which will take to the streets. Yet, we hear about divisive politics as though we are teetering on the edge of an abyss….I don't think we should be guarding against 'divisive politics' but rather 'mono-politics'  that there is only one narrative, one view and it must necessarily be the right or the best perspective – unless you don't trust me. That is too tall an order for any citizen to submit to.""",8,131,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00131
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Let us unpack and interrogate some of these assumptions in what I term ""the dominant narrative"". Firstly, do we want an active citizenry that feels that it is worth participating in politics by speaking out, listening, caring and getting involved in political discourse vs just retreating into private life? I think we should and I hope all hon Members want that. And if we take that ideal seriously, we should never treat differences of opinion as necessarily equivalent to polarisation.",9,132,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00132
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Polarisation happens only if some groups of people oppose others for the sake of opposing and not in a reasonable, fair-minded way. Polarisation happens only if vindictiveness and tribalism trump thoughtfulness and basic human decency. No pun intended in the use of the verb ""trump"", by the way.",10,133,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00133
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, disagreement and agreeing to disagree does not imply disrespect. One can disagree with respect, courtesy and decency. It seems that everyone, nowadays, welcomes that well-worn phrase ""robust debate"". But we do sometimes hear in this House that the other side has not explained the trade-offs properly and, therefore, was being dishonest in some sense.",11,134,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00134
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"During very major recent debates in this House, the Opposition explained how there were alternatives to a GST hike that would slow the rate of growth of reserves; and that there were alternatives to a housing ecosystem based on the promise of asset appreciation and that these alternatives would lead to some weakening in the resale market.",12,135,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00135
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Were those trade-offs denied, hidden, glossed over? No. The trade-offs were explained. I think in our political discourse and even in our debates in this House, we should strive to treat Members' views and other parties' views fairly and accept when there is a philosophical or ideological difference, call it what you will, rather than being too quick to label the other side as ""disingenuous"". Such labels can affect the tone of discourse in the wider society, if alternative ideas become demonised or labelled uncharitably. Rather than chip away at trust in the Opposition with such labels, the Government should focus on explaining why it disagrees with the Opposition.",13,136,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00136
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, on the need to keep political discourse rational, I do not think anyone would disagree with this. However, to have rational political discourse, we need transparency of information. We do not always get this. There are many examples of Parliamentary Questions that do not elicit the information requested without an explanation as to why that is the case. Sometimes, outcomes of public consultation are not made public. There is a great deal of public opinion surveying done by the Government, some of it through opinion-sensing agencies like Rysense, for example. Not all of this is made available for public scrutiny and debate.",14,137,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00137
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Lastly, I come to the oft-repeated call for trust in Government. I think trust in the independent institutions of the state is a very good thing, where it is warranted. But should the public blindly trust the Government as in the political leadership, regardless of whether relevant information has been shared; regardless of what the Government says or does? Surely not. That goes against the active citizenry which the President's speech referred to.",15,138,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00138
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, some speak of a democracy of deeds. But surely, we do not want a citizenry that is active in deeds, but blind, apathetic or timid in thinking. Such a citizenry may engage in the wrong deeds. And to trust the Government – does that mean that, since the Government and Opposition sometimes disagree and not, hopefully, irrationally, does that mean that it is right that the public distrust the Opposition? Surely not.",16,139,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00139
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We should not strive for a political landscape where the public innately trusts the Government, but innately distrusts the Opposition or vice versa. If any Member disagrees with this, please, I would love to hear your views later. We should strive, rather, for a politically educated populace that accords trust based on facts and evidence from independent institutions that function as intended.",17,140,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00140
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"What can we do to strengthen everyone's confidence that we have an open society, where citizens can and should care, listen, understand and debate policies? How can we make everyone believe that there is a more level-playing field for ideas, and not primarily one dominant narrative that you would do well not to challenge?",18,141,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00141
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the interest of time, I will suggest just a few ideas to advance towards this goal which WP Members of Parliament (MPs) have expanded on in previous debates in this House.",19,142,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00142
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One, delink the People's Association from the ruling party. The current system creates a sense that state resources are invested in promoting the Government's thinking and the ruling party's politicians, which unlevels the playing field for politics and ideas in our nation. My hon friend, Aljunied MP, Mr Faisal Manap, will elaborate on this.",20,143,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00143
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Two, create an ombudsman with investigative capacity to strengthen confidence that the state and ruling party are accountable and cannot simply shut down a grievance that may be politically costly or for other reasons. At the very least, a second unbiased opinion would be of value. I have argued for this at length previously, as have other WP MPs.",21,144,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00144
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Three, ensure that funding for civil society, the arts and so on is handled by independent committees who are not linked to the Government of the day. This would certainly help build the passionate civil society that President Halimah spoke of and counter any fears that civil society groups that advocate alternative policies to the Government may be penalised using state resources.",22,145,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00145
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Four, since we do not have a Freedom of Information Act, we should publish every single public opinion poll and data collection effort conducted with state funds, redacted only for anything that has clear and strong commercial or national security sensitivities for better-informed debate amongst political parties, civil society groups and citizens.",23,146,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00146
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Five, allow Opposition MPs to engage school students in their MP capacity, alongside ruling party MPs and Ministers, a subject I have raised in this House before. We need to mould the mental habits of our citizens from a young age to nurture independent, critical thinking.",24,147,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00147
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Exposing them only to People's Action Party (PAP) politicians in schools and barring non-PAP ones in most student engagement contexts does not achieve this. Our future citizens need to be able to see both sides of a question, in a way that will inoculate them from the demagogues and foreign interference attempts of the future.",25,148,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00148
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, we must not allow any sense to congeal that there is one dominant narrative and that everyone who has a different view has to be marginalised or go on the defensive.",26,149,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00149
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I now come to the second part of my speech on the optimism of Singaporeans. Will tomorrow be better than today?,27,150,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00150
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"According to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer survey, only 36% of respondents in Singapore felt that their families will be better off economically in five years' time, only 36%, the lowest level for this measure since Edelman started surveying 23 years ago. This 36% for Singapore compares with the 40% global average across 24 countries.",28,151,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00151
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, the Leader of the Opposition spoke of the risk of there becoming two Singapores. Right now, close to 50% of households live in 5-room HDB flats or more expensive homes, private homes and so on. A little over 50% live in 4-, 3-, 2- or 1-room HDB flats.",29,152,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00152
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"At the risk of oversimplification, those who live in less expensive homes may be the ones feeling the economic anxiety and pessimism that the Edelman survey measures. They may struggle to compete in the workplace or academia, especially if they did not receive the inherited advantages of wealth or social capital that President Halimah spoke of. The elderly on fixed or no incomes have to grapple with rising food prices. Whereas others, the optimistic 36%, may feel that they can thrive in this very competitive society with high prices and expensive homes.",30,153,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00153
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In fact, poverty and social inequality ranked as the third big area of concern in a national survey done in 2020 by Ipsos, after jobs and healthcare. At this point, I declare my interest as the Chairman of a Singapore company that undertakes market research and consulting.",31,154,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00154
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, when we have discussions like this, it is often pointed out that real wages are still growing. But the Edelman survey, plus a great deal of anecdotal experience from my conversations with Singaporeans in the Serangoon ward of Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and East Coast GRC previously, suggest that this anxiety is very real. Many fear that the way food, house and other prices are rising, the way the job market is becoming more competitive, those with fewer advantages will truly struggle to build a tomorrow that is better than today.",32,155,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00155
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Also, we should recall that real wage data may mask some things. Real wages may appear to be rising but that may mask the fact that certain demographic groups may feel the pain of inflation more than others.",33,156,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00156
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Previously in the House, I have called for Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to be published by demographic group, for example, parents with young children or empty nesters, as inflation affects these groups differently. Also, within each income decile, there will be those who do less well than the median for that decile.",34,157,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00157
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And lastly, the Edelman survey shows that whatever the real wage growth data suggests, the thinking of many Singaporeans about the future reflects a lack of confidence that they can thrive going forward.",35,158,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00158
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This economic pessimism could be one reason for our globally low total fertility rate, or TFR. In the previous housing debate, I also cited academic evidence for a causal link between high home prices and low TFR in Singapore. If left to fester, such economic pessimism could lead to a brain drain as people leave for more liveable countries. If that happens, that may tend to create over-reliance on foreign manpower.",36,159,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00159
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We need to address this economic pessimism fundamentally, not only through ad hoc measures such as an additional grant here or an additional rebate there, helpful as that is. More far-reaching reforms are needed to make everyone believe that this society has their back. The WP has called for many such reforms in the past.",37,160,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00160
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the interest of time, I shall not expand on these, but I shall refer to them. One, a national minimum wage. Two, a redundancy insurance scheme. This is something the WP has championed for some time and I was intrigued by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s reference to some form of unemployment support. Three, seriously tackling the issue of poverty and breaking the poverty cycle. I have called for a war on poverty in this House. My hon friend Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has also weighed in on this topic yesterday, as have other WP MPs over the years. Four, reforming the Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing system to lower Build-To-Order (BTO) prices by revisiting the formula for land valuation as well as introducing various other reforms, as we argued in the recent housing debate. Five, revamping trades or vocational jobs to overhaul them for higher productivity, pay and conditions. I have spoken about this in the House several times.",38,161,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00161

I believe slowing down the growth of reserves is wholly justified at this stage of our nation’s history, given the needs we have with an ageing population in a turbulent world and given the much larger size of reserves now versus GDP, as they were in the past. My WP colleagues and I have explained this repeatedly, on multiple platforms.",39,162,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00162

2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We have been doing this. We offer alternative policies that differ substantively from the ideas of the PAP, for example, on slowing reserves growth to enhance liveability, social justice and social mobility and reducing BTO prices based on tweaks to the land valuation formula. The alternatives we have championed in Parliament, in our manifesto are too numerous for me to mention here. I only have 20 minutes. In fact, I only have less than five minutes left.",42,165,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00165
2023-04-18-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We championed an expansive acute hospital bill insurance scheme and permanently delinking BTO from resale prices long before this was adopted by the PAP Government.

To keep our economy vibrant and to support the needs of our ageing population, Singapore needs a large pool of foreign complementary workforce. Hence, the foreign residents today constitute 38% of the labour force and represent 27% of all residents in Singapore. Singaporeans are faced with a dilemma of accepting this reality and creating a welcoming culture of integrating our foreign guest workers into our communities, or, allowing the continued tight labour situation to (a) negatively impact our service quality and the Singapore brand; (b) cause the burnout of our workforce due to their having to double-up for the shortage of labour; and (c) limiting our companies' growth opportunities, just to name a few.

Hence, the idea behind meritocracy is that the most talented and hardworking individuals should be given opportunities to succeed, regardless of their background or social class or their gender. Many positive outcomes of meritocracy have been realised  (a) top of the list is social mobility and many amongst us can stand to be counted as beneficiaries; (b) another positive outcome is that meritocracy promotes a more efficient and effective workforce as individuals are rewarded for their achievements and their hard work; and (c) meritocracy is largely seen as a fair system, thus promoting justice and equality.",6,240,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00240

And this is not always the case since those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have the same resources or access and that can limit their chances of success. Two, meritocracy can be limited by how we define merit. In Singapore's case, merit has been closely associated with paper qualifications and, hence, the phenomenon of the ""paper chase"". The narrow definition of merit to paper qualifications does not consider other qualities which, in fact, are competencies needed for the 21st century workforce, and these qualities include EQ, creativity, ability to communicate with influence or even craftsmanship and other non-traditional skills. Most of our employers in Singapore recruit, pay, promote and advance their employees based only on paper qualification primarily. Three, meritocracy can also create social division as those who are successful may attribute their success as solely due to their own merit rather than recognising the role of their family, the larger environment and society that has enabled and empowered them to be successful.

2023-04-18-T-005,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Three, rewards motivate behaviour. The next step is to review the rewards system across the board. How are the teachers evaluated and rewarded? Are the students rewarded based on academic achievements primarily or behaviours of their values in action? How are parents engaged in the process to fulfill the common purpose of educating their child? Are students encouraged to share their knowledge and their skills with classmates who may need help?",22,256,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00256
2023-04-18-T-005,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Rewards motivate behaviour. We cannot ask the educators to deliver one thing, but measure and pay them on something else.

2023-04-18-T-005,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"And so, I come to the next point. Specifically, admission criteria for students to progress can afford a rethink. How do we reward team spirit and team behaviour and perhaps penalise negative individualistic behaviours when crafting admission criteria? While we do want to develop our students to their best potential and have them be the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good LEadership and Service (EAGLES) and soar, we ought to take a lesson from nature as even eagles in the sky fly in formation and take turns to be at the head of the ""V"". This formation helps them to fly longer distances. Perhaps, MOE and the schools and the parents might take this lesson on board and rethink the criteria used for rewarding students EAGLES.",24,258,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00258

I have heard stories of how smart students attain Singapore Government's prestigious scholarships only to break bond and worse still, the intention to do that was already there even at the point of application. The Government might want to rethink the purpose of Government scholarships and perhaps consider giving more scholarships to students who both have merit and financial need. The Public Service Commission (PSC) may also want to review the penalties for persons breaking bond and make them punitive enough, likened to defaulting their National Service (NS) commitments, so as to incentivise the right behaviours and values.",25,259,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00259

2023-04-18-T-005,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Another recommendation I have is for Government to send their scholars to serve their bond in local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This will spread out the talent to our local industry and, at the same time, these smartest of the smartest of Singaporeans will have a better understanding of issues on the ground and be better policy-makers when they return to the Public Service.",28,262,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00262

How can we help teachers by having them do less administrative work so they have more student encounters? How can we help to unburden their stress and keep their mental wellness in glowing condition? A kind word, a thank you, a please, a smile from the students and from parents would mean so much. And I would like to add that teacher-student interactions play a big part in educating the child. As we have falling enrolments due to fewer babies born each year, one proposal that I hope MOE can consider and I heard it in the House just now as well, is to bring down class sizes to less than 30 students per class.

These MENDAKI volunteers understood our customs and culture and thus helped to augment the Government's efforts to improve Malay/Muslim educational outcomes in tandem with other communities. Today, 99% of every Malay student cohort completes at least 10 years of education. This is a meaningful achievement, as the 10 years of education provides the foundation to enable them to further their studies at the post-secondary level and enable them to pursue lifelong learning.

We are doubling down on our efforts to support families with young children through Project Dian@M3 and will also facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower income families into Anchor Operator preschools and MOE Kindergartens.

Experts think that our high rates is partly due to greater detection from higher awareness and testing, and if data from developed countries like the US is an indication, we may detect more cases in the future. Hence, it is important that the Government expedites the setup of a national infrastructure to provide holistic support for Singaporeans with autism, from diagnosis to end of life.",2,518,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00518

There are many schemes and grants available, but some business owners have trouble navigating and understanding the processes. They are confused by the red tape and even need external consultants to advise them on what they are eligible for.

They can keep and hog the COEs for months and trade and sell these COEs to other car dealers. If only individual buyers or companies which need COEs are allowed to bid for them, it may bring down the COE prices of Category C.

How can we recognise and reward them more formally? Can there be an ""independent study"" subject that allows the student to choose a topic of interest to deep dive into and be given a grade that is just as important as an English or math subject, so that we move towards learning that is more versatile, more blue-skies thinking and hopefully, less need for tuition, which is often cited as a costly endeavour that widens the gap?",15,550,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00550

What happens if enterprises increasingly feel that ""it's okay"" to ignore ethics, to be irresponsible and just do whatever to make money?

Many of them come from very humble backgrounds, working hard to get to where they are today.

Nonetheless, I too feel the pressure when my peers talk about selecting preschools, whether to choose Mindchamps or Odyssey vs the preschool right under the block.

The Primary 1 registration system essentially aims to address many different goals and does strive to ensure diversity in the student cohort. My concern though, is that for certain more popular schools, more privileged families may have more advantage for the different phases. For example, a family may move to a location to have an edge in terms of proximity. Parents working to make ends meet may also be unlikely to be able to spare the amount of time needed to fulfil the volunteering hours needed to qualify for Phase 2B. Alumni places in prestigious schools in affluent neighbourhoods may also contribute to the risk that certain schools may become more exclusive with a more homogenous, higher socioeconomic status (SES) student population.",10,579,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00579

For parents who are working, having a workplace with supportive bosses and colleagues can make a lot of difference. It is understandable for parents with young children to need some time off occasionally to bring their child to the doctor, look after a child who has fallen ill, or simply to cheer their child on who is receiving a prize or performing in school.

2023-04-18-T-005,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),(In English)  One example I know of was that of a family in distress. The head of this family was the eldest of a group of siblings. The family lives in my constituency.,8,638,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00638
2023-04-18-T-005,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"The eldest daughter was trying very hard to be independent and cope on her own while tapping on various assistance schemes.

2023-04-18-T-005,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"The ability to plug the gap in the last mile can determine the success or failure of our measures. Very often, the person to bridge the gap is a neighbour or a volunteer who is not as constrained by the rules and regulations of the system and can thus take certain steps to close the loop.

2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Today, I will focus my speech on the topic of ageing, specifically, the concept of productive longevity.",2,649,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00649
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),We have made significant progress to support successful ageing in Singapore in the preceding half term of the Government. We raised the retirement age to help seniors stay active and engaged in society. Our CPF schemes were updated to better cater to the changing needs of the ageing population. We have strengthened our healthcare system through Healthier SG by focusing on preventive care. We are also scaling up healthcare and long-term care facilities in the community to better support our seniors.,3,650,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00650
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"But there is still much more to be done. Being a country with one of the highest life expectancies in the world, but also one having the lowest birth rates, we face a double whammy. We must address the reality that every household in Singapore will eventually have a senior member.",4,651,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00651
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It is projected that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. This ratio is expected to increase further.",5,652,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00652
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"This rapid expansion of our ageing population means that the productive engagement of our seniors is no longer optional. It will be an absolute necessity. We must encourage our seniors to engage in gainful activities that will not only benefit themselves, but also their families, communities and society as a whole.",6,653,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00653
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I will speak on three general areas – work, contribution and care for others – three areas which I believe are critical elements for productive longevity.",7,654,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00654
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, work. Steve Jobs once said, ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do."" Wise words, indeed. We can continue loving what we do even as we grow old. We must thereby support our seniors to work longer for those who want to, are healthy enough and still have the passion to do so.",8,655,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00655
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"The relevant initiatives in this year's Budget are a step in the right direction. It is heartening to note that our senior employability rate is healthy, compared to OECD countries. Correspondingly, we should focus on creating quality jobs for our seniors. This enables them to utilise their depth of knowledge and experience obtained over a lifetime.",9,656,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00656
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"The health benefits associated with ongoing mental engagement are numerous. Moreover, mentoring and job-sharing allow seniors to pass on their skills to younger and less experienced employees.",10,657,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00657
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"That said, it is important to recognise that many older workers desire part-time work with flexible options which allow them to spend time on leisure and with their families. I fully support the call for more flexible work options for seniors, as previously emphasised in my Committee of Supply speech.",11,658,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00658
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"There are several ways that we can implement these options, such as sabbatical leave, job-sharing, micro jobs and phased retirement.",12,659,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00659
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"These concepts are relatively new to our workforce. As such, there may be resistance and scepticism from employers. The Government should take the lead and show how they can be implemented with minimal disruption while still reaping the benefits.",13,660,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00660
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),I urge the Government to take more proactive measures to introduce and incorporate these concepts into more places of employment.,14,661,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00661
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is the concept of giving. We must actively encourage our seniors to volunteer and share their skills with others. Silver years can be a time for renewal where individuals can explore new passions and interests, engage in meaningful activities and continue to contribute back to society. The numerous benefits of volunteering for seniors include better self-rated health, higher life satisfaction and prevention of cognitive decline over time.",15,662,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00662
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Organisations like RSVP Singapore are excellent partners in growing senior volunteerism. However, we should assess our current volunteerism framework and determine how we can increase volunteerism rates.",16,663,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00663
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"How do we compare globally with other countries on this front? Are there specific targets that we have set ourselves in this area? Besides, it would also be helpful to consider other demographic factors, such as income level, gender, race and religion, to ensure that volunteering opportunities are inclusive and varied.",17,664,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00664
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Third, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we should enable care. Care for seniors and recognising caregivers' contributions. This includes providing informal caregivers with more support and professionalising caregiving as a career to meet the rising demand for caregiving needs. The role of a caregiver is a challenging one that requires significant physical and emotional effort.",18,665,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00665
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"With our demographic shifts, we are also now seeing a greater number of seniors caring for other seniors. In my Yio Chu Kang estate, I have a 70-plus-year-old daughter caring for a 90-plus-year-old mother. This is becoming a regular scenario. Regrettably, we often see the bulk of caregiving responsibilities being shouldered by a single individual – typically a wife, mother or daughter.",19,666,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00666
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"There remains a significant gender disparity in caregiving, with women assuming a disproportionate amount of the workload. Can we take steps to encourage men to participate more in caregiving? Achieving this will require us to challenge the societal norms and gendered attitudes that place greater emphasis on men building careers and less on caregiving responsibilities.",20,667,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00667
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It is essential to enhance caregiver training. This is to ensure that caregivers have the necessary skills to look after their loved ones competently. There are currently over 40 training providers offering more than 200 Caregivers Training Grant-approved courses. Nonetheless, it is pertinent to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes. What is the current take-up rate and how beneficial do participants find these courses? Additionally, we need to increase awareness about the availability of these courses and ensure that the accessibility and scheduling meets the demand. How can the Government provide additional support in this area?",21,668,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00668
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Expanding caregiver support is critical, as Singapore's population ages and more people require informal caregiving. MOH has taken steps to enhance caregiver support. Besides training, as mentioned earlier, over the years, enhancements have been made to financial support, caregiver respite services and platforms to help with care navigation. There have also been continued attempts to encourage flexible work arrangements (FWAs). It is also good that we are recognising that caregivers themselves, too, need self-care to prevent burnout. Can we explore ways to improve caregiver support, such as offering additional caregiver leave?",22,669,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00669
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As the demand for caregiving services continues to grow, we should recognise caregiving as a viable career choice. Professionalising caregiving may attract more people to the profession and improve the quality of care provided. Presently, caregiving is often associated with tasks like medical escorting, personal care and housekeeping.",23,670,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00670
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"On the contrary, caregiving extends beyond these roles. There are opportunities for specialisation and leadership, including caregiver trainers, managers, schedulers and care assessment professionals, just to name a few. To formalise these roles and provide the necessary training, we need to develop a scheme to professionalise caregiving.",24,671,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00671
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As part of long-term planning, we should also consider formal education to provide a solid foundation for professional caregiving and certification. For instance, many community colleges and healthcare agencies in the US offer courses to obtain home care certification. Highly skilled caregivers have more opportunities to service clients, especially those with specific needs, such as dementia or physical challenges.",25,672,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00672
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, with higher life expectancy, how will the ""good life"" look like? How can we fully embrace the opportunities that comes with living longer? I have shared in my speech that one way is to embrace productive longevity. It is to be empowered to lead our lives the way we want to – to work, contribute and care for others. To do so, we must also reframe our concept of ageing  first, it is not about when, but now. I circle back to what I said earlier in my speech – an often-quoted statistic – that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above.",26,673,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00673
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"But we must remember that ageing continues, as we speak. Currently, almost one in five Singaporeans are aged 65 and above. We see it all around us. I certainly see it in my estate in Yio Chu Kang. Over the past three years, I have seen how our residents have aged. It is very visible. More seniors are moving around in the neighbourhood with wheelchairs and walking aids. More requests for aged care services. More wakes to attend.",27,674,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00674
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, it is about opportunities, not about liabilities. Productive ageing requires a shift in our thinking from a paradigm centred on ageing as being problematic, to one which views seniors as resources – assets that can continue to contribute to society in various ways. It is about opportunities for growth and contribution, rather than casting the aged as a liability.",28,675,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00675
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Finally, we need to shift from ""them"" to ""us"". Ageing affects not just our seniors. Ultimately, it is about all of us. Growing old is inevitable. We will all grow old one day. A simple shift on using more inclusive terms, such as ""we"" and ""us"", in place of ""they"" and ""them"", helps all of us to remember that we are all ageing. Personally, I sometimes do get comments from my residents that I look young. But I remind myself that the operative word is ""look"" and that we will all grow old one day and be forced to reckon with our own mortality. We will all need to come to terms and embrace the experience of ageing.",29,676,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00676
2023-04-18-T-005,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Finally, we all have different versions of what is the ""good life"". Notwithstanding, most will agree that to leverage productive longevity, we will need to embrace our silver years – to work, to contribute and to care, and by acknowledging that ageing is not about when, but now; it is about opportunities, not about liabilities; and it is not about them, but about us.",30,677,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00677

Hence, there is a need for the Government to continue to invest heavily in education, SkillsFuture, reskill and upskill training.

Whatever more to do or to be done, we should continue to leverage and enhance on our existing schemes.",6,685,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00685

Hence, would the Ministry be able to advise if the current old-age support ratio is acceptable, in view of the rise in the average Singaporean's income and the continued investment in education and lifelong learning and training for Singaporeans? We may also need to consider if we should let each generation self-finance their needs in old age, for example, using their life contributions to the nation to avoid burdening our children and grandchildren.",9,688,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00688
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"At the same time, to survive and stay competitive, Singapore must remain open. But there is a limit to how many foreigners or new citizens any country can absorb before the sense of shared national identity is affected. We must maintain our Singaporean Core and, at the very least, prevent our TFR from declining further. I certainly hope that it is partly due to 2022 being the year of the tiger in the lunar calendar, which usually sees fewer births among the Chinese, and not another indication of a shrinking future generation.",10,689,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00689

The proportion of singles in the age group below 50 years has increased and, more significantly, the increase is highest among those below age 35 – the age group which is most conducive for having children.

What kind of activities and events do the young find attractive and relevant in today's context? For example, do the participants get to learn or experience something meaningful, even if they do not meet someone special?",14,693,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00693
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"If that is the case, SDN will be able to attract more participants, enlarging the pool and increasing the chances that singles will meet other interesting singles there, as SDN should also be able to offer a value-add which is to provide the assurance that all participants are screened and they are who they claim to be.",15,694,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00694
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Ministry of National Development (MND) is making the effort to ramp up BTOs for all applicants, especially for first-timer families. We welcome the good news. It has many supportive policies which I commend, but I would like to make a request for future flats to be built bigger, like the older flats built in the 1980s and 1990s. A sense of greater available space is more encouraging for families to have a second or third child.",16,695,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00695
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"From our experience from COVID-19, there is a need to review to expand the programme to build early, before the sale of the BTO flats, with shorter waiting time of 12 to 18 months.",17,696,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00696
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Many families with young children depend on migrant domestic workers (MDWs) and nannies to help out with caregiving. However, the standards of their service can vary widely. Is there any way for MOM to set up a training, assessment and accreditation scheme which parents can use to inform them of the capabilities of the maids or nannies they are considering to hire?",18,697,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00697
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"There is a shortage of infant care, childcare and kindergarten teachers or centres in certain areas. For parents, it is important for their children to be enrolled in centres near their homes to minimise travelling for the kids. Will the Government look into the distribution of these centres and staff, how to attract teachers into these sectors and minimise the attrition rate?",19,698,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00698
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Next, I would like to move on to request for a review of measures to manage our national income gap. We have to continue our effort to minimise the social divide in our society. Values which divide high- and low-income groups should be discouraged and harmonious social integration needs to be strengthened.",20,699,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00699
2023-04-18-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),This also applies to the workplace. There is a need for employers to establish policies to nurture a harmonious and caring work culture in our workplaces. A good leader in the company is not only measured by tangible results. He must be able to motivate all his team members with different capabilities and abilities to work hand in hand and care for one another as a team.,21,700,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00700

2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, the arrival of family offices in Singapore is still a relatively new concept. We have seen strong growth in a short period of time.

2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The first stage – governance – is about establishing an effective operational base and putting in place a governance framework under which the family office will operate. Good governance requires careful consideration. How should they set up their legal and trust structures? What systems should they put in place, from financial monitoring to cybersecurity? What should their board and risk management processes be? How can they attract and hire the right talent in Singapore? Who should they appoint as their advisors? How can they meet the evolving regulations in Singapore which have been introduced to raise the bar?",16,719,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00719

2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, with the office and governance structure in place, family offices then focus on investments.

2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Investments are often the main purpose of the family office. However, before they deploy a large amount of capital or any amount of capital, family offices need to build a robust understanding of the investment landscape so that they can home in on areas of opportunity. Fundamentally, they seek good financial returns and sound business models to invest in, and this often takes time to understand and evaluate the different investment options available. Also, the market environment in recent years has been challenging.",20,723,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00723
2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),They also need to find like-minded partners for co-investments. Many family offices tell us they prefer to co-invest with other families – but only with those that they know and trust. A newly-arrived family office will need to build up these trusted networks before they can co-invest effectively.,21,724,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00724
2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),One current gap is the lack of a systematic on-boarding process to integrate newly-arrived wealthy individuals into Singapore’s enterprise and investment ecosystem so they can become active members of our venture community. There is also a need to help them become aware of the promising research and tech innovations that we have in Singapore from our startup communities and research institutes and where they can help commercialise and scale promising new ideas.,22,725,2023-04-18-T-005-S-00725
2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),Family offices tell us they struggle to navigate the fragmented and fast changing landscape.

2023-04-18-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),Newly set-up family offices need more help to connect the dots of the full spectrum of what Singapore has to offer.
