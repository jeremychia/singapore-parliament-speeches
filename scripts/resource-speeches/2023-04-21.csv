2023-04-21-T-001,Gan Siow Huang,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has provided all primary schools with sufficient internet-enabled devices to support students' learning in school. MOE also periodically reviews the level of provision to ensure that it meets the needs of schools' teaching and learning programmes.",1,2,2023-04-21-T-001-S-00002

2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 2 to 4 together, please?",1,7,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00007
2023-04-21-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,8,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00008
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,My response will also cover the matters raised in the questions by Mr Louis Chua,1,9,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00009
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me first provide some facts that have been requested. The annual number of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who received cancer drug treatment and services increased from 22,500 in 2017, to 31,500 in 2021, which is a 40% increase. Eighty-four percent received treatment in Public Healthcare Institutions, or PHIs, and 16% in private medical institutions. And this proportion has remained stable over the past few years.",2,10,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00010
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A Member asked about the adequacy of the MediShield Life claim limit for cancer drug services. We have received similar feedback earlier and have recently increased the claim limit for cancer drug services from $1,200 to $3,600 per year. So, increased by three times. This is sufficient to cover the essential cancer drug services incurred by more than nine in 10 subsidised patients in our PHIs.",3,11,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00011
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Other Members raised concerns that generous insurance coverage, especially Integrated Shield Plans, or IPs, and IP plus riders provided by commercial insurance companies, will continue to contribute to the rapid escalation of cancer drug prices. I thank the Members for sharing the Ministry of Health (MOH)'s concern which gave rise to the recent policy changes.",4,12,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00012
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,But first let me explain the key reasons for the rapid rise in cancer drug prices over the past years.,5,13,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00013
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Firstly, as a small market, Singapore lacks negotiating power and can pay higher procurement prices. With the Cancer Drug List, or CDL, announced in August 2021, drug companies have lowered their prices in order to include their drugs in the CDL so that they can get financing coverage, namely subsidy plus MediShield, MediShield, MediShield Life and IP coverage. Since these changes, we have negotiated an average cost reduction of 30% for most drugs, and over 60% for some drugs.",6,14,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00014
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We can plough the money saved on procurement costs into more subsidies. Annual Government spending on cancer drug subsidies increased from about $12 million for about 50 drugs before the CDL announcement in August 2021, to around $80 million for more than 100 drugs from September 2022.",7,15,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00015
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Secondly, because of the high level of anxiety surrounding cancer, high-cost cancer treatments are often prescribed even where costs are not commensurate with the established clinical benefits. Overseas studies have found that about half of new cancer treatments were introduced without evidence of benefit to survival or quality of life. However, patients and their loved ones all hope for a cure.",8,16,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00016
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"""As-charged"" insurance policies, including IPs and riders, are policies where coverage can be effectively limitless and patients have limited co-payment; they further encourage this practice where non-cost-effective cancer treatments are prescribed. These are ""as-charged"" insurance policies.",9,17,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00017
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The CDL also addresses this issue. It sends a strong signal to patients and doctors to use clinically proven and cost-effective treatments, which are covered by subsidies and MediShield Life from 1 September 2022 and IPs from April 2023.",10,18,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00018
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Now you still have riders which can still cover non-CDL treatments. But with the policy changes effected by the CDL, the costs of these treatments will have to be reflected in the rider premiums, rather than loaded onto MediShield Life and IP premiums for the broad majority. In other words, the high cost of non-cost-effective drugs will not be socialised.",11,19,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00019
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thirdly, the mark-up of cancer drugs by some healthcare providers may be quite significant. This is again encouraged by ""as-charged"" IPs and riders, which provided for effectively limitless claims.",12,20,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00020
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOH had in 2018 taken steps to moderate this by requiring all new riders to have a minimum co-payment of 5% and typically capped at $3,000 a year, for treatments from panel doctors. From 1 April 2023, we took another step to require IPs to set claim limits for cancer drug treatments, instead of having no limits at all. So, the IPs ceased to be ""as-charged"".",13,21,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00021
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For cancer drug treatments, most IPs provide coverage of up to five times that of the MediShield Life limit for treatments on the CDL. This is sufficient to cover cost-effective CDL treatments at up to 2.5 times that of unsubsidised PHI prices.",14,22,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00022
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,A few Members have also raised concerns that the new CDL limits for riders – such as 18 times of the MediShield Life claim limits - continue to be high and can push up cancer drug prices.,15,23,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00023
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MOH shares the concern. We will review how to improve the transparency of cancer drug prices to help patients make informed decisions and encourage providers to calibrate their mark-ups.,16,24,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00024
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,We are also monitoring cancer drug claims and coverage closely and will work with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to take further steps to regulate IPs and riders if costs continue to escalate.,17,25,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00025
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the meantime, we urge individuals to consider the long-term cost of the insurance products they purchase against the level of protection they need. The fact is that our CDL is more extensive than similar listings in most developed countries, including South Korea, Australia and the UK.",18,26,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00026
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MAS also requires insurance intermediaries to properly assess if a health insurance product is suitable for a customer's needs and financial situation before recommending the product to the customer.,19,27,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00027
2023-04-21-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.,1,28,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00028
2023-04-21-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, would the Ministry be prepared to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) to develop a platform like Price Kaki which will allow patients to compare cancer drug prices across the public as well as the private hospitals and clinics? Second, pharmaceutical companies may be selling the same medications to Singaporeans at higher prices than other countries with comparable economic situations. Would the Ministry be prepared to work with MTI and CCCS to investigate this?",1,29,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00029
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. The first is a good idea. I think MOH can work on this together with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) and the medical community, without involving the CCCS. Such price transparency itself will be quite useful. So, it is something we will study and I mentioned that in my reply.",1,30,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00030
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the Member's second question, differential pricing across countries, this is widely practised by many global suppliers, including by pharmaceutical companies. I should first say that pharmaceutical companies are our close partners in healthcare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they are the ones who provided us with vaccines and a way out of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. So, they are our partners.",2,31,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00031
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But we also understand they incur quite a lot of research costs which have to be recovered through drug costs when something is approved and able to be distributed. In so doing, they too maximise their revenue by pricing the drugs in different markets differently. So, differential pricing and it is commonly done. Internationally, this is not considered something illegal; neither can MTI or CCCS do anything about it because they do not have the extraterritorial power.",3,32,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00032
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But what we have done is through the CDL, it gave us some negotiating leverage to talk to the pharmaceutical companies, to say, ""Please lower the prices for the drugs that you supply to Singapore. If you do so, it crosses our cost-effectiveness threshold, it can be in the CDL, and therefore, it can be subsidised and enjoy MediShield Life claims.""",4,33,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00033
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So far, we have been quite successful. I should reiterate a point raised in my former reply just now. Today, our CDL is actually quite extensive and in fact, longer and more comprehensive than many similar listings in many developed countries around the world.",5,34,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00034
2023-04-21-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.,1,35,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00035
2023-04-21-T-002,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just one supplementary question for the Minister. I understand that the CDL is a positive development for our healthcare system. But at the same time, a lot of the insurers are responding very quickly to this legislation and introducing various riders. I understand from the Minister's response the Ministry is looking into this. So, my question is whether the Ministry will look into whether insurance companies are profiteering from this. And eventually, the concern is whether or not, this could all end up as higher premiums for the various policy-holders as a result.",1,36,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00036
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. Before I directly answer the question, let me explain what is happening now.",1,37,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00037
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the past, as we know, MediShield Life provides the basic level of protection. Above that, there is IP; and above whatever IP does not provide, riders would provide. So, you look at the cake as three layers.",2,38,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00038
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the past, what happens is, an IP has limitless claims. We call this ""as-charged"". But it requires some co-payment and riders sit on top of IPs to cover part of the co-payment. But with the recent changes, that relationship has been flipped. Because an IP now has quite a strict coverage of four, five times of MediShield Life. So, IP has lower coverage. It also does not cover so many drugs because non-CDL drugs are no longer covered; IP coverage has shrank. But now, the ballon is squeezed out into the rider space. Insurance companies now come in with riders with 18 times coverage – so, not ""as-charged"" but 18 times or a very high absolute number.",3,39,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00039
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think there is an impact now where it is no longer ""as-charged"" but the entire IP plus rider is now capped, albeit a very high cap. I think we need to monitor this. The way consumers respond will be quite key. If consumers heed our advice, that if you just look at our CDL which is quite comprehensive and that IP coverage is actually quite adequate; and if they stick to just buying IP, then I think the problem can be addressed.",4,40,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00040
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When it comes to the riders, they should look at the price. Riders have to price in higher coverage plus more drug coverage, so they will be priced higher; and you cannot use MediSave – you can only use cash.",5,41,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00041
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, if rider demand goes down and most people think IP is enough for them, I think we have addressed the problem.",6,42,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00042
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But if consumer behaviour does not change and consumers continue to buy riders, notwithstanding high premiums, then, I think I agree with the Member, we may have a problem. In which case, as I had mentioned just now, together with MAS, we will be prepared to regulate IPs and riders.",7,43,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00043
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member mentioned the word ""profiteering"". I am not sure I would describe the insurance sector that way. I think they are competing. I am not sure they are profiteering from it. But because they compete, they try to fight for market share, they offer a wide coverage – sometimes, it is, in the long term, not very sustainable for their business.",8,44,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00044
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In healthcare, it is a very complex system. Regular market economics do not quite work and if need be, if we have to regulate, we will do so.",9,45,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00045
2023-04-21-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.,1,46,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00046
2023-04-21-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Speaker, can I ask the Minister one question  will the payout, the claims on the rider, affect the MediShield Life greatly?",1,47,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00047
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Based on the current design, our sense is ""no"", because now, we have isolated MediShield Life and IP with the CDL, with a limit. So, the rider itself is an outlet; and we can cover more drugs, higher limits, and it should be priced accordingly.",1,48,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00048
2023-04-21-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, we will observe. My sense is that based on today's design, the answer is ""no"". In the past, the answer is ""yes"". And it is not fair to the great majority who do not use non-cost-effective drugs.",2,49,2023-04-21-T-002-S-00049

I have a couple of supplementary questions. One is that the Minister of State mentioned that during the disruptions at Changi Airport and the land checkpoints, the sea checkpoints were not affected. So, the question is that why did we not do the upgrading at the sea checkpoints first, rather than to do it straightaway at the busiest part of the Changi Airport, as well as the land checkpoints?",1,83,2023-04-21-T-003-S-00083

2023-04-21-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As to the amount of the tax that is payable, it is too early for me to give a number now because the investigations are still ongoing. But if there are cases where the rightful amount of ABSD is actually not paid fully, as I mentioned in my reply, IRAS will be able to ask the buyers to pay for the full amount and may impose a 50% surcharge in such cases.",2,138,2023-04-21-T-004-S-00138
2023-04-21-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Taxpayers who wish to come forward voluntarily to disclose and make good any underpayment of taxes may do so. Of course, IRAS will look into each case on a case-by-case basis depending on the circumstances. But in general, I would say that if you come forward in such cases to voluntarily disclose, IRAS will look at the case more favourably.",3,139,2023-04-21-T-004-S-00139

2023-04-21-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health),"The suggestion that hospitals may prematurely discharge patients due to the zero tolerance against abuse policy creates a false dilemma. The great majority of patients are respectful and appreciative to healthcare workers. As for the very small minority who are abusive, they typically do not require urgent care and may not even be patients. It is also not difficult to identify such behavior and actions, which the common man or woman will find unacceptable. As for the rare instances where a patient requiring urgent care is abusive, we will manage them sensitively and, as was also previously explained, care will be delivered as needed.",3,145,2023-04-21-T-005-S-00145

2023-04-21-T-005,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,"Are there a series of warnings or other types of escalating measures that healthcare institutions can take with patients and/or their family members for behaviour that constitutes abuse or harassment? For example, would there be any intervention from a social worker or someone with conflict resolution training to ensure that healthcare staff do not deal with the situation alone? And how many warnings are issued? What is the process before any punitive action is taken against these individuals?",2,149,2023-04-21-T-005-S-00149
2023-04-21-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"At this juncture, our public healthcare clusters have policies in place to handle abuse cases. The staff are trained to assess and de-escalate potential conflicts and manage abusive situations and, in the event of an incident, they know how to activate protocols to escalate when patients or caregivers turn abusive. Signs are displayed at the premises to prominently remind visitors to treat healthcare staff with respect and, where necessary, security officers' or Police intervention would be sought. So, at the moment, there are some measures that the hospitals have put in place, including issuing a warning, disengaging by refusing unreasonable requests or discharging abusive patients who are clinically assessed. These are all things that are available to them at this juncture.",1,150,2023-04-21-T-005-S-00150
2023-04-21-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"But generally, the hospitals do not do this. They still treat the patients. Hence, there is a need to actually come up with this framework and this is the framework we are working on to provide something that is standardised for all the public healthcare institutions to apply, where there is a commonsensical approach to deal with such situations of extreme cases where there is a need to actually deny service to them.",2,151,2023-04-21-T-005-S-00151
2023-04-21-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"But at this juncture, there are already efforts in place to de-escalate, to give warnings, to make sure that it does not come to that situation.

Mr Speaker, with regard to the incident highlighted in the Members' questions, no classified information from Singapore has been reported or detected so far. There were two pieces of information related to MINDEF contained in those ""leaks"", but they are not sensitive and they are information that is already in the public domain, namely, that the SAF uses the SPYDER air defence system and that a British Defence Singapore Support Unit is located in Sembawang to provide support services to visiting vessels from Australia, New Zealand and Britain as members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA).",1,160,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00160

I will assume that the Members' questions relate more to protecting information online and will not deal with the protection of physical assets.",3,162,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00162
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"At the highest level of security, highly classified information is stored in air-gap systems with only internal connectivity and strict protocols for access and monitoring. This keeps the information secure but there is always a trade-off which impacts on efficiency for the organisation. Apart from productivity, classified information needs to be shared when plans are reviewed or when dealing with quick cycle events where information is needed expeditiously. All defence organisations face this conundrum through levels of classification in order to strike that balance between protection and utility.",4,163,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00163
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"When dealing with external parties or external partners, whether they be commercial or government-to-government, there are agreements for protection and handling of classified information and mutual obligations to protect both parties' classified information. But there is a limit despite these agreements in which MINDEF/SAF can control or compel standards of protection in their systems. Therefore, their security standards form an integral part of the assessment when MINDEF awards contracts. In some cases, companies assessed to have inadequate security standards have been dropped from consideration even when their products may be superior or competitively priced.",5,164,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00164
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"In all systems, even ones with the most stringent protection, humans are a potential source and cause for leaks. Attempts to enter into secure systems by exploiting the vulnerabilities of selected individuals with access, using phishing emails or other means are an everyday occurrence. Proactive steps are taken to educate our personnel to mitigate against this vulnerability. MINDEF/SAF has also a cyber-monitoring centre that is stood up to detect malware and other threats posed online.",6,165,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00165

2023-04-21-T-006,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In the incident in the US, the access to the classified documents was by relatively low-ranking individuals within the service. How does the Ministry/SAF ensure that personnel who have access to classified documents in Singapore are properly and regularly vetted to prevent any leak of information? And how do the agencies continue to ensure that there is no untoward or unauthorised access, retention or removal of information, such as the incident that we saw in the US?",2,168,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00168
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I think the start point is the acknowledgment that our systems, like systems everywhere, can be vulnerable to exploitation, either technologically or through human intervention. So, we, therefore, must develop systems in order to secure ourselves the best we can and part of that would include constant 24/7 monitoring to pick up abnormal patterns of behaviour and to be able to then react quickly to them and effectively.",1,169,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00169
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"On the human front, as I explained in my answer, this is also an acknowledged source of vulnerability. And as the Member himself has also mentioned, there is a system of vetting and re-vetting. And this happens not only with incumbents periodically, but also whenever there are changes of personnel who are to be granted access to classified information. It is not foolproof, I agree, but, at the same time, we do it very systematically and rigorously to make sure that, to the extent possible, we take down that risk. At the same time, we constantly emphasise reminding, educating as well as emphasising the consequences of breaches to all related personnel so that everybody knows that this will not be tolerated and the full force of the law will be applied when there are breaches.",2,170,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00170

2023-04-21-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To the best of my recollection, this is probably at least the third time where confidential or information shared with the US government has been leaked.

2023-04-21-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"So, my question is whether our Government has made changes in the way that it communicates any sensitive information with the US or other governments to minimise the risks of such leaks?",3,174,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00174
2023-04-21-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And the context of that is that in 2011, in the wake of Wikileaks, I had asked the then Foreign Minister, George Yeo, about whether we would change the way we communicate on the diplomatic front and he had said that ""Well, we have to because if it happens once, it will happen again"". So, my question is whether the Government has actually changed the way it communicates information, especially sensitive information, with the US or other governments?",4,175,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00175
2023-04-21-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, it was reported in this recent incident that information from ST Electronics was also leaked, and that is, of course, not a Government department as such. So, does the Government actually work with such entities that may have sensitive information to minimise the risks of such information wrongly getting out in the public domain?",5,176,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00176
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. On the first one relating to the sharing of information with foreign governments, these are done through government-to-government agreements, such as the one that we have with the United States. Certainly, wherever there are instances or incidents of a breach and so on, then these are all very specifically investigated in order to establish what might be the vulnerability, and what might be the additional measures that must be put in place in order to minimise the risk of such recurrence.",1,177,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00177
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,And I think the Member would also agree that this will be an endless endeavour in the sense that you can never predict what might be the next breach but it is constant vigilance and established processes in order to mutually review and to tighten up.,2,178,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00178
2023-04-21-T-006,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"The sharing of information is itself important for the ensuring of security in so many different aspects and certainly the utility of that is also not to be compromised. At the same time, we must look at how best to safeguard, especially as technology moves and especially as perpetrators look for new ways to do it.

And as part of my explanation earlier, I have also explained that MINDEF takes very seriously how we assess a provider in terms of the standards of its cybersecurity in deciding whether or not to award a contract of whatever classification that will be appropriate to that vendor. And where there are weaknesses exhibited in the systems of that vendor, we would certainly take that into account immediately, in working with that vendor on what happened, how do you strengthen your system to prevent recurrence and how we should take that into account in our future evaluation of contract awards.",2,183,2023-04-21-T-006-S-00183

Business owners who are service sellers in multi-year contracts have given me feedback that they may be locked into contracts which be up to 10 years, especially if this is related with longer term municipal and infrastructure maintenance projects.

2023-04-21-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, the issue of re-negotiating multi-year contracts occurs largely in PWM sectors where outsourcing is more common, such as in cleaning, landscape, security, lift maintenance, for example, where the contract periods may vary – to the best of my knowledge, most within three to five years. There are some exceptions as the Member has mentioned but these are typically minority with some peculiarity such as waste management, for example, which runs up to seven years.",1,194,2023-04-21-T-007-S-00194

Therefore, there is that realism that is injected where we the tripartite partners in the cluster committees understand what the practices are, what typical renewal cycles and how the contracts are structured to make sure that this is sustainable.",2,195,2023-04-21-T-007-S-00195

2023-04-21-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In this case, with the recent increase, I acknowledge that we are in a phase where there is stronger growth prospects that we expect or we want for our low-wage workers and therefore, I know the industries are probably feeling how the wage grows are accelerating a lot quicker than they expected. Hence, that is why we gave one to two years advance notice and the Government has also stepped in with PWCS as I mentioned that covers some of the 75% of wage increases, in the next coming two years and runs for about five years, although at different rates. But these are how we manage and try to support the industry, to make sure that it does not overburden the industry.",4,197,2023-04-21-T-007-S-00197
2023-04-21-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Having said that, I find it quite disappointing to hear that there are service buyers who wish to blacklist service contractors, when in fact, it is clear that these wage schedules are put out in advance, over a six to seven year period, where you have time to adjust and re-negotiate and most contracts do have clauses in which you do have opportunities to re-negotiate midpoint.

More importantly, over the long term, we hope that this remains sustainable. I hope the Member take this into account and the unions can also do that part to help to mediate between the service bias and contractors for the benefit of their workers too.",6,199,2023-04-21-T-007-S-00199

2023-04-21-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai for that question. What I had said and I will repeat that here, is that if you go back to those debates in Parliament in 2018, we opposed a hike of GST from 7% to 9%.

It was actually being increased progressively from 3% to 4% to 5%. And, in around 2007, it was increased from 5% to 7%. So, I take it that as far as my learned friend, or rather, the hon Member Mr Perera is concerned, this implicit decision to accept GST was made in 2018 when the Government conveyed its decision to propose an increase of GST from 7% to 9%. And if that is the case, then I think we have a happy situation because the gulf, or the gap, between the WP and the PAP is now narrowed from 9% to now 2%.",2,287,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00287

Be that as it may, as prices spiral out of reach of many Singaporeans who aspire or need to buy a car for different reasons, can we not do more to review how we can ensure that businesses, whether ride-hailing companies, car leasing companies or car dealers, do not push up the COE premiums at the peril of private buyers who need to buy a car for various different reasons.",4,299,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00299

One importer reported encountering problems with the homologation and/or registration for EVs. It was also reported that EV models with dual electric motors require proper documentation from manufacturers that confirm their power rating and this makes it tougher for parallel importers to register these cars for road use as, unlike authorised dealers, they do not have direct contact with the car makers. Another importer stated that EV options are quite limited for parallel importers and they hope for, I quote, ""better support in terms of clarity on importing rules"".",10,305,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00305

2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, foreigners in Singapore. WP MPs know from our engagement with the public that a unique Singapore identity – proud and distinctive – has formed but continues to evolve. Insofar as a new social compact is concerned, Singaporeans seek a fairer, more inclusive and more caring society. The Government recognises this and my colleagues have signposted areas where these objectives can be operationalised.",6,327,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00327

2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"With respect to tangible benefits for Singaporeans, the WP has made that specific point repeatedly and we continue to see it as an important requirement to ensure society remains welcoming of foreigners.",8,329,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00329
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The WP has also made calls for a report card on the Industry Transformation Maps and job outcomes for Singaporeans. The publication of outcome-based indicators of Government policies would be useful tools in ensuring continued public support or at least understanding of the Government's foreign talent policies. Providing evidence of how foreign talent policies help Singaporeans in concrete ways will help prevent xenophobia, something we must always guard against.",9,330,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00330
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, it is useful for me to restate the point the WP made on the Parliamentary debate on free trade agreements and the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in September 2021, a point that Minister Ong Ye Kung brought up yesterday. As that debate proved, getting the People's Action Party (PAP) Government to reveal information on the number of intra-corporate transferees from India that worked in Singapore upon the introduction of CECA was like squeezing blood out of a stone.",10,331,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00331
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Parliamentary questions had been filed by the WP on the issue from 2016 but forthright answers were not forthcoming. In the meantime, pressures and tensions on the ground built up as a small number of Singaporeans became emotionally charged about CECA, using it as an adjective and in very uncharitable and downright racist ways. The WP sought information, answers to which could have shed light and reduced heat before things reached a boiling point. Unlike as suggested by Minister Ong yesterday, sometimes filing a parliamentary question does not guarantee receiving an adequate and substantive answer from the PAP Government from which alternatives can germinate.",11,332,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00332
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Moving forward another potential tinder box that the Government should look at closely is the growth of family offices, inflows of foreign wealth and how Singaporeans are taking to these developments. There are already murmurings of discontent that are led by emotional perspectives, created by facts such as the mass buying spree of properties in single developments by foreigners. If the Government does not step in early and fill the information vacuum on how outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans are enhanced, this subject may turn ugly too and it would be important for the Government to be on top of this.",12,333,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00333
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In future, the PAP must not see calls for information as a Trojan horse for ulterior motives or a red herring.

2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In moving this Motion, MP Mr Murali Pillai stated that we must recognise that the nature of the electorate is changing and today, a new generation is emerging – standing taller and brighter than the ones before.

2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On the point of the Prime Minister's Office's Strategy Group's addendum covering better integration of newcomers into society, I had proposed an English requirement for PRs and citizenship applications in last month's Committee of Supply debate. A few weeks later, in a demographically representative poll of 500 Singapore-born citizens aged between 18 and 69, a CNA MediaCorp survey reported on 3 April this year, this month by CNA found that almost 80% were in favour of an English test for new PRs and citizens.",16,337,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00337
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Prior to the release of the survey result, in some limited quarters, the proposal for an English requirement was incorrectly understood as a divisive one with the implicit point being that mother tongue languages would somehow be compromised or that an English requirement was actually a test for ""Singaporeaness"". But these criticisms missed the key point of the proposal, which was focused on integration. I am gratified that the demographically representative survey respondents did not miss the point.",17,338,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00338
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The wide support for an English requirement, as shown by the survey, can perhaps be traced to the historical use of English in Singapore, as established by the Pioneer Generation of PAP leaders. In the 2012 publication, Singapore's Bilingual Journey, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, and I quote, ""When Singapore celebrated its 21st National Day on the 9th of August 1986, it also celebrated a different sort of milestone. It was the first-time emcees of the event used English to lead the audience, where before they had to use three languages – Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. The crowds, likewise, responded in English. Where before the different races in Singapore were like different tanks of fish in an aquarium together before your eyes but segregated from one another, now they have a common language linking them together. They still retained their mother tongues whether Chinese, Malay or Tamil? But a common knowledge of English enabled them to share together the joys of the occasion. I was a proud man that day.""",18,339,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00339
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On the occasion of the 100th year of his birth, this year, those words of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew are timely. The late Prime Minister was clear. English would be a functional language with which to access the knowledge of the world and a tool for survival. The mother tongue is the cultural language used to transmit the culture's traditional values. More than three decades since his words in 1986, Singaporeans understand that immigration is necessary to top up our population but they also instinctively appreciate the importance of a lingua franca for better integration with newcomers and the signal it sends of Singapore as a multi-racial and multicultural nation not just in form, but in substance. So, no one should be surprised at advocacy for our lingua franca, namely English, to bind Singaporeans together. At the same time, however, we must never sever our cultural roots. All of us must remain proud and celebrate our individual cultures, including our mother tongues.",19,340,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00340
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"One legitimate concern, however, is the possible difficulty of an English requirement for foreign spouses who apply for PR or citizenship. Sir, WP – in its 2020 manifesto – called for the fast-track naturalisation of foreign spouses on the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LVTP+), subject to certain conditions, such as having at least one Singaporean child. I would suggest that an English requirement for foreign spouses can be one of the criteria for fast-tracking these applicants. My proposal calls for, all other things being equal, that additional points or consideration be given for PR and citizenship to foreign spouses who have a working proficiency in English. As the Government has openly stated, our immigration policy and immigration intake is calibrated to preserve the racial balance and by extension, an English requirement would not favour one racial group over another just because applicants in one racial group already use English and the other does not.",20,341,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00341
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, a fast-track for foreign spouses would give families in Singapore with one Singaporean spouse much peace of mind. In effect, for foreign spouses, the English requirement would serve as a plus one criteria or bonus criteria. It would nudge and better align immigration policy with our bilingualism policy, which is a fundamental aspect of the Singapore system. For the record, this WP proposal does not contradict any of the eight principles of Singapore's bilingualism policy established by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.",21,342,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00342

2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, let me move on to my third point. I did not expect the Deputy Prime Minister to use his speech on the President's Address to attack and accuse the WP of advancing opportunistic or populist ideas to chip away, bit by bit, the trust in Government. The PAP shifted its position yesterday in the course of the debate. when Minister Ong Ye Kung conceded that the WP have brought up many good ideas. But both Ministers were consistent in calling for the Opposition to present an alternative agenda and even an alternative Budget. I will deal with this point in the course of my speech.",24,345,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00345
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To address Deputy Prime Minister Wong, if all we were doing was putting forward populist, unrealistic policies, we would not see the Government actively considering some variation of the WP manifesto ideas on anti-discrimination legislation, minimum wage and redundancy insurance. If chipping away at trust in the Government was our real agenda, we would not see the Minister for National Development (MND) acknowledging the WP point highlighting the inherent inequity of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) taxpayer subsidies as currently applied between mature and non-mature Build-to-Order (BTO) flats.",25,346,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00346
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It is a most unfair charge levelled at the WP which, in reality, chips away at the integrity of our Parliamentary democracy as an important platform for the exposition and contestation of ideas.

In our 2020 General Election manifesto, we called for the introduction of Employment Pass credentials assessment. We said that all Employment Pass and S Pass job applicants with university degrees and diplomas should be subject to mandatory educational credentials assessments, with cost to be borne by the applicant.

In our 2011 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for equitable support for single parents. In our 2011 manifesto, we stated that while having children outside of marriage should continue to be discouraged in our society, children born to single parents should not be denied the benefits that children of married parents receive. The children are innocent parties and should not start life being disadvantaged. We said that single parents should receive the same parenthood benefit packages as married parents.",31,352,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00352

In addition, we argue that single mothers should be made eligible for both the Working Mother's Child Relief (WCMR) as well as the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy (FDWL) relief. Excluding single mothers from these schemes unnecessarily penalises vulnerable children and single mothers. We added that the Government should extend the same help to single fathers. On 9 November 2016, the Government announced that from January 2017, unmarried mothers would have 16 weeks of paid maternity leave, equal to their married counterparts and fathers would have two weeks of paid paternity leave.",32,353,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00353

We proposed that first-timer BTO applicants on the fiancé-fiancée scheme be given priority up to their third try in selecting a flat so as to minimise the waiting time for couples to buy a flat and plan for starting a family. We called for the priority to be forfeited if the first timer BTO applicants were invited to select a flat in any one of their previous tries but did not book a flat.",33,354,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00354

From the August 2023 BTO exercise, first timers who fail to choose a flat once will be deemed second timers for a year in the computer ballot. Second timers who accumulate one non-selection count, down from the current two counts, will have to wait one year before they can apply for flat again.",34,355,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00355

In our 2020 General Election manifesto on curbing the use of plastics, we called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge, phased in over five years to encourage a reduction in plastic waste while looking for alternatives. This is what we said  the value of the charge would need to be sufficiently high to change behaviours but remains sensitive to the needs of lower socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities. We called for a nationwide public education campaign to raise awareness of the effects of single-use plastics and other more sustainable alternatives. On 2 March this year, the Government announced a plastic charge at most Singapore supermarkets from 3 July 2023, with two-thirds of all supermarkets imposing a charge of at least five cents for each carrier bag.",35,356,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00356

In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago, the WP called for the family doctor pairing scheme. We argue that pairing families with GPs would encourage patients to remain with one family doctor who would be more familiar with their background and medical history. This would facilitate earlier detection of illnesses, provide more accurate diagnosis, reduce duplication of treatment and improve coordination with other care providers.

In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago again, the WP called for the fair regulation of mandatory flexi-work arrangements, where companies should be obliged to cater for a work-life friendly environment for workers. We suggested that employees who work for a company with more than 20 employees for more than six months should be allowed to make requests for flexible working arrangements. Employers could refuse the request on reasonable business grounds but must discuss the options available with the employee.

Had the question on the WP position on the GST per se been asked then, the answer would have been obvious. The WP policy positions cannot be immutable and have to evolve with the political realities of the time. We may not have supported the GST when it was first introduced decades ago but we recognise it as part of the system.

2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"What the Deputy Prime Minister is true in a theoretical sense. The elections are about who forms the government. But as the PAP itself likes to tout, Singapore is unique. The political reality in the Singaporean context – a combination of the first-past-the-post system, the size and footprint of Opposition parties, certain grassroots organisations' manned by PAP apparatchiks and an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee that comes under the Prime Minister's Office, amongst other factors – all these reveal that the real prospect for a change of government during General Elections today, conceals the advantage of the PAP's incumbency far more than the Deputy Prime Minister cares to let Singaporeans in on.",57,378,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00378

On the heady dreams of displacing the PAP and forming the government, the reality is the WP is a small party and we have a long way to go. Our medium-term objective is to ensure that one third of the seats in this House are not in the PAP's hands.

Some of the changes included amendments to Article 9, that sought to ensure that laws relating to the misuse of drugs that authorise the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and rehabilitation, remain valid under the Constitution. A separate change involved the introduction of a legal mechanism to reduce the balance of the Contingencies Fund so as to maintain discipline in how the Government manages its finances.",64,385,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00385

There were 4,200 intra-corporate transferees working in Singapore the year before – that is, 2020 – a number that has remained consistently small.

Mr Leon Perera had – if my memory serves me correctly and I stand corrected, Mr Speaker, I am going based on memory alone – asked the question on the number of intra-corporate transferees in 2016. And the answer in Parliament from the Minister for Manpower was, ""we don't reveal these numbers."" And the point we were making – and the point I made in my speech again today – was if those numbers were released, because the numbers were low – they could have punctured all that xenophobia quite early. And the point I am making was I could not understand why it was difficult to provide the information in 2016.

We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true.

If we have released, perhaps, it would have quelled all the xenophobia and all the raw emotions. But as Minister Tan See Leng said, that data was graded confidential or maybe even secret, I am not sure. But it was not ready for release, because when you release intra-corporate transferees of a particular country, others may compare, it can have other ramifications. So, it is not something that Ministry officials will readily say, ""Let us release it for Parliament"". But the situation became like that. CECA became a big issue with a lot of raw emotions, got debated here. In the end, these Ministers had a serious discussion and said ""Let us release it"".

But because Minister Ong mentioned yesterday in the context of presenting alternative budgets, alternative agendas, he said, ""just file a question, you'll get a written answer"". I think that caused me to pause. Because the answer that was given in 2016 – and again, I stand corrected if my memory fails me – was not that the reason we are not releasing the ICT data was because there could be commercial sensitivities and so forth. In fact, there was no reason given at all, if I am not wrong. It was ""We don't release this figure, period"".",1,431,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00431

And I have to add, again, I am going back six years. So, I remember the question of CECA did not just drop from the sky in 2015, 2016, 2017, around that period. Factually, the Government website, also had to come out and clarify some of these issues. So, in that context, I am not blaming MOM or pointing the finger at MOM, but making a larger meta point about how important it can be for information to be released and to take a different attitude towards it.",2,432,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00432

2023-04-21-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Sir, on the larger point that the Leader of the Opposition Mr Singh had highlighted, I am glad that he agrees with me that we do need both serious Government and serious Opposition in our maturing democracy. I made the point in my speech. He has a different view on the way I have characterised some of the proposals made by the Opposition. That is his view and I accept that. I think there we may well have to agree to disagree.",1,434,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00434
2023-04-21-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But I made this broader point about how our democracy will evolve because I do worry when I look at how democracies elsewhere have evolved. Look at the great democracies of the world. Democracies far bigger, far more developed than us and look at where they are now – how their societies have become divided and polarised, how their systems have become stuck in gridlock. It is not as though their people are unloyal to their countries – not at all.",2,435,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00435
2023-04-21-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But how is it that these countries have become so dysfunctional where politics is concerned? And what makes us so sure that Singapore is immune and we somehow can avoid such a fate happening in Singapore down the road? So, I think there are lessons for us. And the lessons are, if you look at many of these countries, populism has taken root and populism has damaged greatly their societies; divided and polarised their people.",3,436,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00436
2023-04-21-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong),"What is populism? Populism is politics that suppresses the truth, shades the truth, gets into post-truth, distorts the facts for political advantage. Populism is politics that pretends there are simple answers to complex issues, because there are not. And if such populism were ever to take root in Singapore, well, in the short term, parties that push out such populist policies may gain some advantage, but in the longer term it will cause great damage to Singapore and Singaporeans.",4,437,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00437
2023-04-21-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, from the Government's point of view, our stand is very clear. We reject all forms of populism. We make sure and we uphold honesty and integrity in policymaking. If the Government were ever to fall short of these standards, we expect the Opposition to call us out and say so. Please do. You have to do it. We expect you to do it.",5,438,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00438

One is, from the point of view of the PSP in the course of all my debates with the Government, is, one, data is really not enough. Two, which is quite obvious over the last few years from my experience in this Parliament, is the attitude of the Government towards the Opposition.

So, on the issue of data, can I ask the Manpower Minister, Dr Tan See Leng, that I was the one who initiated the job debate in 2021, and the purpose of initiating that debate is to really determine whether Singaporeans overall have been affected by the foreign talent policy or not. But until today, would the Minister agree that we do not have enough data to conclude with certainty that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the job market?",1,456,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00456

2023-04-21-T-012,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"At the start of this Parliament term, I delivered my maiden speech titled ""The Nation that Learns the Fastest"". I spoke then about what I felt was needed for Singapore to thrive in a rapidly changing world  the importance of lifelong learning, the need for companies to take responsibility for their employees' learning, the need for companies to give more Singaporeans a chance and to look beyond paper qualifications, the need for stronger anti-discrimination protection, the need for each of us as leaders to go beyond telling people to be better, faster, work harder to providing emotional support, networks and social capital, and the need for companies to be better corporate citizens and proactively address critical social issues in order to earn the social licence to operate.",2,490,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00490

I do not claim to be the first to bring forth any of these ideas. There is no such thing as a monopoly of ideas, but if my analysis and the voices of my residents and other Singaporeans that I have surfaced have had even a small impact on their thinking, I think the past two and a half years would have been well spent.",3,491,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00491
2023-04-21-T-012,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"On the announcements, there are a few areas where I would offer a slightly more nuanced view. Take, for example, the idea of supporting workers to take time off to train. The reality is, many companies, especially SMEs, find it challenging to give ""time off"" to train, and this is exacerbated by the experience that some SME owners have shared with me – that their employees do not seem to bring something useful back to the business after going for training, so, it is almost like sending them on a holiday. This is not good for employees either – the forgetting curve I referred to in my maiden speech tells us that they will quickly forget what they have learnt.",4,492,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00492
2023-04-21-T-012,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Sir, it is really as Minister Chan Chun Sing has said before – business transformation and workforce transformation must go hand in hand. Decoupling training time and working time is less optimal than designing training to be integrated with their jobs while those jobs and the companies they belong to are being transformed. We have to push both, not separately, but together. An even more joined-up approach among the economic, workforce development and skills development agencies, would be incredibly useful.",5,493,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00493

Prime Minister Lee and other Members have talked about the different storms and opportunities that preoccupy us today.

Some jobs will be eliminated. This is not new – we are used by now to technology disruption. But what is going to be different is the scale and speed at which this will happen. So, reskilling and reemployment, at scale, at speed, alongside managing the impact on people's professional identity and self-esteem, is going to be a serious challenge.

Second, that even in proposing changes, many Members abide by certain fundamentals precious to Singapore, such as fairness, multiracialism and our approach of tripartism.",3,562,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00562

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mr Lee did not do it alone. He had a team of capable comrades like Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Rajaratnam, Encik Othman Wok and many more. Together, they laid a strong foundation for Singapore to take off.

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Like Mr Lee and the founding fathers, the 4G team must win the trust of Singaporeans by setting out a clear plan to secure a better future for all.

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Throughout our history, growth has never been for growth's sake. Growth is critical for giving us the means to build a better Singapore and better lives for Singaporeans. Growth allows our people to access good jobs, fulfil their aspirations and raise their families. It generates the resources for our nation to fund needs and priorities, such as supporting families, caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. Thinking longer term, growth coupled with prudence has enabled us to build a buffer to weather many storms.",24,583,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00583

We supported our workers and companies through these crises and retained their capabilities. This enabled Singapore to bounce back quickly.",26,585,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00585
2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"During the COVID-19 crisis, we rolled out five Budgets in one year and eventually drew down around $40 billion from past reserves to save lives and livelihoods. Most remarkably, we did not borrow a single cent, which would have burdened future generations. I am grateful, as a citizen, that we could do this. Without strong growth and the discipline of setting aside resources to provide a buffer against the unexpected, Singapore and Singaporeans would have been worse off.",27,586,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00586

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"First, scientific and technological innovation will reshape every sector of the economy even more rapidly than before. Industry 4.0 is reshaping jobs and skills. Today, robots can enable factories to operate round-the-clock. In fact, I myself have seen several dark factories, where it is not even lighted up, because the robots were all doing the job and they did not need lights. And an AI can spot disease on x-rays as accurately as a human radiologist. Ms Mariam Jaafar spoke about the impact of AI earlier.",31,590,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00590
2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"New sectors like the digital economy and renewables, biotech and a whole range of others are advancing rapidly. There is now a more dynamic corporate landscape of startups and smaller companies, pushing the frontiers with greater agility. Many traditional firms and workers will find this competition unsettling. Competition not just from other countries or from foreigners, but from greater automation and AI. Yet these advances also offer the best hope for addressing global challenges like climate change and ageing populations, from extending healthy longevity, to new low-carbon technology that can bring us closer towards a net-zero world. We must learn to harness the best of science, technology and innovation, while supporting our workers and companies to ride these advances and blunting the sharp edges that they bring.",32,591,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00591
2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Second, as countries realise the critical importance of technology, technological supply chains will increasingly bifurcate and fragment into competing blocs.

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Third, ageing populations, especially in the developed world, will be a challenge for many governments.

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Singapore is facing similar challenges, and we will have to make difficult policy moves like raising taxes to support growing social needs.

2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),We had made a good start seven years ago. The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) mobilise companies and workers in every sector to prepare for the future. We are now into our second iteration.

Resilience to address shocks in the supply chains and sustainability to address carbon constraints.,38,597,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00597
2023-04-21-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"There is also a sharper focus on the future of jobs and skills, to better deploy technology, and prepare for an ageing workforce. I visited two companies which leveraged technology to redesign higher-value and better jobs for their older workers. One automated their entire processes. The founder explained to me that he trained a staff in his 60s to supervise the new automated system. I should tell Mr Leong Mun Wai that the founder was a foreigner who has been working here for many years and the older worker was a Singaporean whom he cared about and said, ""I'd better redesign the process"" to keep him employed.",39,598,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00598

Stratification is very unhealthy and it can lead to entrenched inter-generational stratification as well if we are not careful. So, we need to break down these barriers, not just along racial or religious lines but also between other fault lines in our society – like local and foreigner, the different income groups, between the young and old, as well as inter-generational conflict.",38,687,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00687

Through their own initiative and effort, people are brought together in a variety of ways. For example, within churches, mosques and temples, and other places of worship.

2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We are formulating this carefully and more details on these youth panels will be provided when ready. Over the next few months, we will consult with youths on the panels and on the key policy issues that they wish to see under the youth panels. We look forward to the active participation of our youths to shape the future of our country.",62,752,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00752
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I am confident that our youths will welcome this opportunity. I have always been encouraged by the heart that they have in bringing Singapore forward through my interactions with them.",63,753,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00753
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, let me now conclude. Earlier this month, President Halimah and I met our Youth Corps leaders at the commencement ceremony of the leaders' programme. One of them, Lim Jia Yi, led a project called We+65. Started in 2022, this project reaches out to the less mobile seniors in Sembawang, with activities that helped to improve their mobility as well as their cognitive functions. And it was borne of her realisation that perhaps the seniors were less connected and had less resources available to them.",64,754,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00754
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This was done as part of a volunteering programme with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Blossom Seeds Limited, a charity operating in that area. If you speak to Jia Yi, her sense of responsibility of her commitment to community will shine through clearly. She is passionate about reaching out across generations to befriend seniors, even as she herself is currently a full-time medical student. Busy as she is, she volunteers her time in many other charitable projects and events as well. And while she is young, her leadership was apparent – to bring and convene her fellow youths together to rally them to support her cause.",65,755,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00755
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, Jia Yi is remarkable, but she is also not an outlier. She is one of the many Singaporeans who continue to step forward, without being asked, to contribute their time and their treasure. And we will continue to work with people like Jia Yi, striving to be those granules of sand which connect us to the bigger blocks of our society, our institutions and collectively make us stronger across generations, racial and religious groups and across the diversity of our population.",66,756,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00756
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"When I meet people like Jia Yi, I am reminded that, in fact, we are already different from so many others in the world, with what we have – diversity and harmony that has resulted from a system that structurally fosters equality, social mixing and integration. This is what the wisdom of an earlier generation of leaders have given to us and has allowed us to build on a strong foundation to chase our dreams and fulfil our ambitions.",67,757,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00757
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, let us not throw out what has worked well for us over the years. Sometimes, you must look back, to look forward. And these are the elements, the fundamental building blocks that has made it work for Singapore. To continually work at fostering harmony between diverse communities of different races and faiths, creating opportunities for people of all abilities, talents and interests to excel, powered by a culture of inclusion, care and volunteerism.",68,758,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00758
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, the Semangat yang Baru  Forging a New Singapore Spirit exhibition opened yesterday and I went to visit it. I encourage Members here in this House to visit it. It is at the National Museum and it is free for Singaporeans and PRs. It was an evocative and inspiring exhibition; also, thought-provoking. I left it, feeling a deep sense of pride.",69,759,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00759
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"If there is one lesson that I learnt from this exhibition, it is that as a nation, we do not have much. We never had. We do not have natural resources and we do not have the blessings of a natural hinterland that we can take advantage of or indeed, space – which comes at a significant premium for us.",70,760,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00760
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But what we have is our people. We have always had that. We have always done much better, punched above our weight, gone further with our people. And if can continue to stand as one united people, as we declare in our national pledge, then I have no doubt that we will overcome these challenges, with confidence. And we will see a vibrant, thriving Singapore for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion. [Applause.]",71,761,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00761
2023-04-21-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.,1,762,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00762
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you to the Minister for his speech and for referring to the point I made about an English requirement.",1,763,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00763
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Sir, I have two clarifications. The first is this. I did not say that an English requirement would be a single point of consideration for PRs and new citizenship applications. I think the Minister, in his characterisation, framed it as a sort of litmus test. In fact, I made it clear in my speech today that it was a nudge to align our immigration policy and our bilingual policy.",2,764,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00764
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"And for individuals like foreign spouses who would have some difficulty, especially if English is not a common language that they use; or with respect to Minister's family member who is very old now, for which a test may have been problematic a long time ago – the test is not in that context a veto factor. The existing criteria would apply and it would be a consideration when an immigration decision is considered – that actually this person already has a common lingua franca that many Singaporeans actually share. So, I think the point was a little more nuanced than what the Minister enunciated.",3,765,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00765
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I think the second point is international students who are today foreigners; if they want to enter our primary school system, they already have to take a Cambridge English qualification test. So, it is not as if this is really a left-field suggestion or something which is too off the mark.",4,766,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00766
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"And to that end, I refer to the survey in my speech. I think the Minister would have seen it. The Minister referred to various criteria that we broadly know with respect to immigration. But that survey found the ability to communicate in English ranks number one. In fact, the number one position was shared with economic contributions to Singapore.",5,767,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00767
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"And in that context, I think it is a good time to include what MP Murali Pillai spoke about the psyche of the nation and how people's views change through generations and how important this is becoming as a consideration for some Singaporeans.",6,768,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00768
2023-04-21-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,But I do not want to lean too much into one survey alone. I am sure the Ministry may have a more global perspective of opinion. I am just suggesting that this is something which I felt was important for the Government to consider.,7,769,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00769
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank Mr Singh for that clarification. And perhaps, with your clarification it now appears that we are not that far apart, because you did use the phrase ""English test"" when you first raised it. I think it was during COS. And so, when I heard your speech then and earlier today, a test is a test you either pass or you fail. And there must be consequences if you do not pass. So, it was in that context that I said let us not use it as a single point consideration. But I am glad we have clarified that, and you are now saying that is one of several factors that we look at.",1,770,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00770
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the survey, I understand, and as I said, it is not an unimportant consideration and I accept that. I think we all want to ensure that we can communicate with the people we see in Singapore, at least to a basic degree. And I can see where that is coming from. I can accept the sentiments conveyed in that survey. It is one survey, yes, but it does reflect sentiments in our society and I think we must take heed of it.",2,771,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00771
2023-04-21-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But the point about international students, I think, comes from a different perspective. They are taking a qualifying test for a different reason. Because there is an academic element to their entry into the schools in Singapore. So, I do not think one should conflate the two different tests. There are meant for different purposes.",3,772,2023-04-21-T-012-S-00772

Pleased with his exuberance, I asked whether he was interested to get a sneak preview of what I intended to cover later. He, however, demured. He clarified that what he meant was that once I stand up to speak, it will be a cue for his family who is seeing these proceedings ""live"", that the debate would shortly end.

2023-04-21-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The ""War on Diabetes"" is a multi-year effort. With longer life expectancy and an ageing population, the prevalence of diabetes and number of diabetics can be expected to increase if nothing is done. Based on the National Population Health Survey, there was a slight decrease in the crude prevalence of diabetes in adults from 8.8% in 2017 to 8.5% in 2022. After adjusting for ageing effect in the population, a reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes from 7.8% in 2017 to 6.8% in 2022 was observed. These statistics suggest some progress in blunting a hitherto increasing trend. The Ministry of Health will continue our efforts in tackling diabetes and monitoring our progress.",1,838,2023-04-21-T-016-S-00838

2023-04-21-T-018,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,The tripartite partners' position is that employers should only include restraint of trade clauses in their employees' employment contracts if there is a genuine need for such clauses to protect legitimate business interests. Restraint of trade clauses must be reasonable – they must balance employers' needs to protect their businesses and employees' ability to earn a living. The Courts have set out clear principles on when such clauses are unreasonable and not enforceable.,1,843,2023-04-21-T-018-S-00843
2023-04-21-T-018,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Employers should generally avoid including restraint of trade clauses in the employment contracts for lower-paying jobs. This is because employees in lower-paying jobs are unlikely to have access to information that would significantly harm their current employer's interest. Restraint of trade clauses are also likely to have a greater impact on the livelihoods of these employees.,2,844,2023-04-21-T-018-S-00844
2023-04-21-T-018,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Higher-paying jobs, such as middle-management jobs, are more likely to interact substantively with employers' legitimate business interests due to the nature of the work and position in the organisation.

Since 2018, these seven banks have reported a total of 17 disruptions to their digital banking services that lasted more than one hour. The disruptions were mostly resolved within two to four hours. The root causes of these service disruptions are varied, ranging from lapses in managing system upgrades, to software bugs and misconfigurations, in digital banking systems as well as back-end systems and components.",2,862,2023-04-21-T-023-S-00862
2023-04-21-T-023,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS requires banks to make every effort to ensure that customers have a high degree of access to their digital banking services and to maintain business continuity when systems malfunction. This means banks must ensure that their relevant IT systems are robust, identify and remove single points of failure in their systems, put in place processes to promptly restore their systems following any IT disruption, and regularly validate the effectiveness of these processes.",3,863,2023-04-21-T-023-S-00863

2023-04-21-T-023,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"DBS has since undertaken measures to mitigate the identified gaps. The bank has committed to enhance the resilience of its digital banking system. It is focused on enhancing its access control architecture, by building in more redundancy, monitoring its key system components more closely and improving its system restoration processes.

In early April 2023, MAS directed DBS to conduct a fundamental assessment of the effectiveness and adequacy of the people, processes, and technology supporting its digital banking services. DBS has since established a Special Independent Board Committee to oversee the investigation by qualified independent experts. While the cause of the March 2023 incident appears to be software bugs that are unrelated to the issues leading to the November 2021 disruption, the Special Independent Board Committee is overseeing a thorough investigation to determine if there are common underlying weaknesses that prevented a prompt recovery in both incidents. MAS will take the necessary supervisory actions against DBS following the completion of the independent review.",8,868,2023-04-21-T-023-S-00868
2023-04-21-T-023,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Given the growing scale and complexity of banks' IT systems, we can nevertheless expect brief disruptions from time to time.

At the approaches to the land checkpoints, we have installed preventive road safety measures such as road humps to deter speeding. There are signages to remind motorists of the speed limit and to maintain lane discipline. Officers who are performing traffic control functions are deployed in pairs and are required to put on safety vests, use traffic wands and blinker lights to enhance their visibility to motorists. ICA also ensures there is adequate lighting of the roads, and we take firm enforcement action against those who breach traffic rules.",1,871,2023-04-21-T-024-S-00871

He allegedly lost control of his vehicle and crashed into the Observation Point area, hitting the drop arm barrier, concrete bollards and the 28-year-old APO on duty. At the time of the accident, the APO was wearing a reflective vest and a blinker. The APO sustained a severe head injury and the driver suffered lacerations.

For the past month, we have been going through another COVID-19 wave. Although COVID-19 cases have been rising, estimated infection numbers are a small fraction of previous infection waves. Average weekly hospitalised cases are not high and the number of intensive care unit cases remain low. Several new Omicron subvariants are currently circulating in Singapore, but there has not been evidence of increased severity among recent new subvariants. The Ministry of Health continues to closely monitor the situation.",1,876,2023-04-21-T-025-S-00876
2023-04-21-T-025,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We urge those with acute respiratory infection symptoms to wear a mask if they must leave home, and reduce their social interactions, especially with vulnerable persons.

Some of these flights are in response to emergencies such as those activated for search and rescue operations or to deal with aerial threats. One recent example took place last October when two F-16s responded to a bomb threat onboard a Singapore Airlines flight, SQ33. Our fighter jets scrambled in darkness to escort SQ33 safely back to land at Changi Airport at 6 am.",1,883,2023-04-21-T-027-S-00883
2023-04-21-T-028,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry is concerned that limiting the proposed legislation against workplace discrimination to five characteristics may create unequal protection and tolerance within Government and society towards other forms of discrimination.,1,884,2023-04-21-T-028-S-00884
2023-04-21-T-028,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Our national policy and stance on discrimination is clear – all forms of workplace discrimination are not tolerated. This does not change with the introduction of legislation. The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) set out the principles of fair and merit-based employment. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) takes every discrimination complaint seriously and will provide assistance to those affected. Enforcement action will be taken against errant employers.,1,885,2023-04-21-T-028-S-00885
2023-04-21-T-028,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Introducing workplace fairness legislation is a major step for Singapore. We cannot legislate broad principles.

Briefly, the FY23 Sector Salary Guidelines took into consideration the Skills Frameworks for Social Service and for Healthcare, as well as changes in job sizes and responsibilities. As a result, some job roles were merged and some right sized. Hence, not every job role in the FY23 guidelines is directly comparable to those listed in the previous years' guidelines.",1,890,2023-04-21-T-029-S-00890
2023-04-21-T-029,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In particular, the ""Senior Care Staff"" role was previously mapped to the Social Work Associate grade. The review found that ""Care Staff"" and ""Senior Care Staff"" should more appropriately be tagged to Social Service Assistant grades.",2,891,2023-04-21-T-029-S-00891
2023-04-21-T-029,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The competencies and work performed by some Senior Care Staff under the old guidelines would be commensurate with a higher job level of Social Work Associate in the FY23 Guidelines. This is especially so for staff already earning at levels that exceed the FY23 salary range for Senior Care Staff.,3,892,2023-04-21-T-029-S-00892

2023-04-21-T-030,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider mandating the installation of daytime running lights in cars for the safety of motorists and pedestrians in places with less lighting in the daytime such as multi-storey carparks.,1,895,2023-04-21-T-030-S-00895
2023-04-21-T-030,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The purpose of daytime running lights or daytime running lamps (DRLs) is to make the vehicle more easily visible during daytime driving. This is useful in countries that experience prolonged low visibility conditions in the day, such as during winter and foggy conditions. We do not experience such conditions often, so there is no strong need to mandate DRLs in Singapore. Nonetheless, there are quite a few car models that have DRLs installed. In dimly lit environments, such as multi-storey carparks and in other low visibility conditions such as heavy rain, motorists should ensure that their headlamps are switched on so that they are able to see the road clearly and can be seen by other road users.",1,896,2023-04-21-T-030-S-00896

For example, during the COVID-19 period, PA worked with Ministry of Health (MOH) to raise awareness of safe distancing measures, and to explain and assist in the vaccination programme. PA spared no effort during the pandemic to look after our residents, going door to door, providing a calming assurance to our residents, and going the extra mile even when it meant risking the health and safety of staff and volunteers.

However, in the course of our regular inspections, MOM inspectors have come across food storage and drop-off points that fall short of our expectations and dormitory operators have been instructed to make the improvements. These include ensuring that food storage points are adequate and sheltered.

The Government's view is that the issues should be addressed through a community-based approach, where community partners, Government social or municipal agencies, and grassroots leaders work together to resolve them, with some legal framework, to allow steps to be taken to deal with the noise nuisance. These are not issues that Police need to, or should, deal with.",1,910,2023-04-21-T-034-S-00910

2023-04-21-T-041,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has since November 2022, catered for Special Assistance Lanes (SALs) at the passenger halls of Changi Airport to facilitate automated clearance of family groups of up to four persons, including children aged below six.

2023-04-21-T-042,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) assesses vehicle safety using internationally recognised vehicle safety standards. Currently, there are no safety standards involving the colour of the vehicle, as it is not common international practice to assess vehicle safety by colour. As such, there are no strong grounds for LTA to introduce measures to reduce the number of dark-coloured vehicles.",1,940,2023-04-21-T-042-S-00940

2023-04-21-T-043,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Adult Monthly Travel Pass further lowers the cost for heavy users of public transport. Any reduction in the pass price will reduce revenues and need to be offset by fare increases for other commuter segments and/or other measures.

2023-04-21-T-045,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To safeguard and preserve the local identity of our hawker culture, only Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are allowed to operate and work in hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators. To address manpower challenges faced by our hawkers, we have introduced some schemes to help them adopt technology which could allow them to achieve higher productivity in food preparation and service delivery. For instance, we recently enhanced the Hawkers' Productivity Grant, which provides hawkers with up to 80% co-funding support capped at $7,000, for stall-level kitchen automation equipment and digital services solutions, such as e-ordering and queue management.",1,948,2023-04-21-T-045-S-00948

2023-04-21-T-047,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It is more instructive to look at MediSave balances at the point of death for Singaporeans who lived till at least 85 years old. Otherwise, it will give a misleading picture of excessive MediSave savings. The requested data for those who passed away aged 85 or older has been provided in the reply to Question No 7 for Oral Answer on the Order Paper for 27 February 2023.",1,953,2023-04-21-T-047-S-00953
2023-04-21-T-047,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Nevertheless, if we want to examine the data for Singaporeans who passed away at a younger age, the median MediSave account balance of Singaporeans who passed away at aged 65 or older between 2017 and 2021 is about $9,900. Among these, about four in 10 had $5,000 or less, three in 10 had between $5,000 and $20,000, and three in 10 had more than $20,000 left in their MediSave accounts at the point of death respectively.",2,954,2023-04-21-T-047-S-00954

As was announced previously, the Ministry will work with public healthcare clusters to develop the details of the standardised zero-tolerance policy in the second half of this year. There is no intention to pass this into law. However, healthcare workers will continue to be protected under the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act, and we will not hesitate to report egregious cases of abuse to the Police for investigation.",1,959,2023-04-21-T-049-S-00959

2023-04-21-T-050,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Oral health therapists (OHTs) have a wide range of career options. As their training incorporates the skills of dental hygienists and dental therapists, they are qualified to work in any dental clinic in the private or public sectors.
