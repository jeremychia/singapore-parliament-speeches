2023-05-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will first start with the point of sovereignty. Self-determination, sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the non-recourse to the use of force are fundamental principles of international law. These principles are enshrined in the UN Charter, and 193 states are party to the Charter, including Singapore.",1,12,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00012
2023-05-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Article 1(2) of the UN Charter states that one of the UN’s purposes is “[t]o develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace”.",2,13,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00013

2023-05-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine violates these basic principles of international law, including self-determination, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the non-recourse to use of force. In my speech that Mr Vikram Nair refers to, I think I said four times that the Russian invasion cannot be justified.",6,17,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00017
2023-05-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Russia has invoked Indivisible Security as among the reasons for the invasion of Ukraine. And as I have said, Indivisible Security cannot give grounds for the Russian invasion. Indivisible Security is not of the same status as self-determination, sovereignty, or territorial integrity and the non-recourse to use of force.",7,18,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00018
2023-05-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Indivisible Security is, I think, best characterised as a concept that is invoked in international relations. And I pointed out that the concept of Indivisible Security, in some form, has been invoked by both Russia and the United States. But that does not make it a principle of international law. And it is not set out in the UN Charter.",8,19,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00019
2023-05-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In addition, in my speech, I shared diverse views on how the situation in Ukraine unfolded and the roles of the West, NATO and the Russian Federation. The result is that Ukraine is the unfortunate victim and its people are paying a terrible price.",9,20,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00020
2023-05-08-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,No supplementary questions.,1,21,2023-05-08-T-003-S-00021
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether remarks on the Russia-Ukraine war by the Minister for Home Affairs at a workshop on 8 March 2023 held at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute represent the views of the Government; and (b) whether there has been any revision to Singapore's position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.,1,22,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00022
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore’s position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains unchanged. We have taken – and we must continue to take – a clear stand that is consistent with our principles and our national interests. In the Ministerial Statement of 28 February 2022 on the ""Situation in Ukraine and Its Implications"", Singapore strongly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The invasion of a sovereign country is a gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter and of international law.",1,23,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00023
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected.",2,24,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00024

2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have three supplementary questions for the Foreign Minister. The first is to ask whether the Foreign Ministry was aware beforehand that the speech on 8 March was going to be delivered by the Minister for Home Affairs. So, the first question is whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) knew beforehand that the speech was being given and did MFA know the contents of the speech.",1,26,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00026
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, earlier, Minister Shanmugam mentioned that Indivisible Security is perhaps a concept in International Relations. So, I would like to ask the Foreign Minister what is the Government's view of such a principle of Indivisible Security.",2,27,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00027
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And last of all, does the Foreign Minister agree that accepting a principle of Indivisible Security is very risky for small countries like Singapore?",3,28,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00028
2023-05-08-T-004,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Ms Lim, I am not sure whether you are levelling all your supplementary questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Law? Because I think your supplementaries actually cover some of what Minister Shanmugam earlier said. So, can I just be clear as to whom you are asking these questions?",1,29,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00029
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Deputy Speaker, I am asking them to the Foreign Ministry because I would like to know the Government's view on this and the speech that was given covered foreign affairs. So, I believe that the views of MFA are very important.",1,30,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00030
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me state categorically – the statements of the Minister for Law reflect the views of the Government of Singapore. We know generally when each Minister is going to speak, we are aware of that. I must tell you we do not personally check every single line and sentence in our speeches and the speeches can evolve according to the circumstances of the event.",1,31,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00031
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Needless to say, under the principle of collective responsibility, you can take it that, as long as we are in charge, the statements of each Minister reflect the views of the Government.",2,32,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00032
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on Indivisible Security, the Minister for Law has already explained it and I do not think I have got anything further to add.",3,33,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00033

2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Sir. One supplementary question.",1,35,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00035
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Would the Foreign Minister agree that, actually, the Government's statements on Russia's invasion on Ukraine have been consistent all this while and there has never been this attempt to say that the US or NATO has been somewhat contributory to the current state of affairs, which was something that the Minister for Law did say? So, I would like him to confirm that up to now, the Government has not taken this position and this is actually something new in the public domain.",2,36,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00036
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, there is nothing new. Our position has been and will continue to be clear and consistent. I have said that on numerous occasions, not just in this House. Various Ministers have also said this, in various fora outside this House.",1,37,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00037
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I must add that foreign policy is something which we all have to take responsibility for, including the Opposition. I am very glad that in fact, the Opposition, of all parties, has ensured that politics stops at the border. I think I can quite safely say that, on behalf of every single Member in this House, our position remains that it was wrong of Russia, it was a breach of international law and of the principles of the UN Charter for them to launch the invasion of Ukraine.",2,38,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00038
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Having said that, I think we must also be very clear in our minds that there are a diversity of views. And when we are explaining these matters to the general public and to our population, or indeed, even in this House, it is not unreasonable to reflect the diversity of views. But reflecting the diversity of views does not alter our national position, based on a defence of our national interests and the principles which a small, tiny city-state like us must subscribe to.",3,39,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00039
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I detect, actually, unanimity in this House, across the partisan divide and I think we should maintain that discipline, that cohesion and that unity.",4,40,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00040
2023-05-08-T-004,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,41,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00041
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Sir. Perhaps one final clarification. Earlier, the Minister said that there is collective responsibility in the Cabinet and that the Law Minister's views reflect the views of the Government. In his speech, he actually said specifically that, in his view, the West and NATO were not uninvolved bystanders who had no role to play in the current situation. So, do I take it that that is the Government's view as well?",1,42,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00042
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me again step back and take a strategic look at this. Why have we taken such a categorical stand? We have taken it because of the vulnerabilities of Singapore as a tiny city-state. And history is replete with tragedy and misfortune falling on small countries. As the Minister for Law just explained – both in his speech and reiterated in this House – ultimately, the victim is the smaller country. Ukraine and Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price.",1,43,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00043
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, our position is clear  that it is wrong, a breach of international law, a flagrant violation of the principles of the UN Charter, the primary victim is the smaller country and it is people who are paying the ultimate price.",2,44,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00044
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"If you want to get into a larger debate on foreign policy, then, I would draw your attention to the fact that we are not in Europe. We are in Southeast Asia. As we collectively craft a foreign policy that is both consistent and protects our national interests, I would say that, on a larger strategic stage, we must always be aware.",3,45,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00045
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"In fact, if you do not mind, let me recite what I said a year ago  ""The events in Ukraine go to the heart of the fundamental norms of international law and the UN Charter that prohibit the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of the international norms, a completely unacceptable precedent. This is an existential issue for us. Ukraine is much smaller than Russia, but it is much bigger than Singapore. A world order based on might is right or where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must, such a world order is profoundly inimicable to the security and survival of small states. And so, we cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was a result of historical errors or crazy decisions. Such a rationale would go against internationally recognised legitimacy and the territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore.""",4,46,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00046
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, I think these are matters on which we are all agreed. You can get into the historical details of how a situation unfolded. Our objective in Southeast Asia is not to let a repeat of the European tragedy occur here, in this part of the world. In trying to avoid a parallel of that situation here, I think it is entirely legitimate for us to consider all views, diverse views, opposing views even, on how the situation in Europe came about.",5,47,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00047
2023-05-08-T-004,,,"I would urge the Member to understand what is at state, understand why we have taken a stand, understand why that stand has to be maintained, upheld and, I hope, shared across the House by all the parties represented here; and also agree that we must not let a repeat of Europe – a continent which unfortunately has been a source of two world wars in the last century – we do not want a repeat of that here.",1,48,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00048
2023-05-08-T-004,,,"And finally, remember that a small nation is always vulnerable. And again, to repeat something I have said multiple times here, never let ourselves be a vassal state, a stalking horse, a cat's paw for any other power. Understand that when we get entangled in such matters, the ultimate loser is always the smaller state. I thank the Member for her interest and I am grateful for her support, and I mean that in all sincerity.",2,49,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00049
2023-05-08-T-004,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Ms Lim, you have asked four or five supplementary questions. I invite you to ask your final one.",1,50,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00050
2023-05-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Based on the Minister's last answer, he did not say whether the Government agreed with the Law Minister's view that the West and NATO were not uninvolved bystanders who had no role to play in the current situation. So, do I take it from him that he would rather not go into such historical matters?",1,51,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00051
2023-05-08-T-004,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"For the Member's understanding, I cleared the speech with the highest levels of the Cabinet.",1,52,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00052

There are things that we – when we are having a forum in Parliament and with the general public, when there is a need to reflect the diversity of views. And I think it was entirely legitimate for the Minister for Law to do so.",1,54,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00054
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Having said that, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, my first job is to protect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial integrity of Singapore. And therefore, there may be times when what I say publicly is entirely aimed at achieving that.",2,55,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00055
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I do not wish to have words put into my mouth, or to make public pronouncements beyond what I have already said, to say that beware that small countries do not get caught up in the manoeuvres, the to-ing and fro-ing, and the dangerous, sometimes escalatory, rhetoric or action the superpowers engage in.",3,56,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00056
2023-05-08-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"And I say it my way, but I believe that my statements are entirely consistent with the rest of my Cabinet colleagues, and we stand and we take collective responsibility for that. I think I have said enough, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am still absolutely certain that there is unanimity in this House on this matter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And I thank the Member for her support. Can I assume I have her support?",4,57,2023-05-08-T-004-S-00057

2023-05-08-T-005,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Sector salaries are reviewed regularly to ensure that salaries in Social Service Agencies (SSAs) remain competitive against comparable roles in competing markets. The recent review took into consideration the economic outlook, wage growth in the general market, including healthcare and public service, the contributions of social service professionals, funding sustainability of SSAs and alignment with the Skills Frameworks for Social Service and Healthcare. In particular, the Skills Maps, which outline the range and levels of skills and competencies required for each job role, were developed and validated with representatives from the sector, academia and the Government.",1,64,2023-05-08-T-005-S-00064
2023-05-08-T-005,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Arising from the review, some job roles were merged or right-sized. These include  one, adjusting the organisation budget ranges for Head of Agency roles; two, merging Executive, Programme Coordinator, Programme Executive and Volunteer Executive into a single Executive role; three, merging Social Worker (Entry) and Social Worker into a single Social Worker role; four, merging Therapist (Degree) and Therapist (Diploma) into a single Therapist role; and five, mapping the Senior Care Staff role to Social Service Assistant job grades, while reclassifying social work associates more appropriately to the Social Work Associate and Senior Social Work Associate roles.",2,65,2023-05-08-T-005-S-00065
2023-05-08-T-005,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"The revised salary ranges for merged job roles provide greater flexibility for SSAs to hire employees at various competency levels and to plan for their progression according to experience and performance.

2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Let me first make a basic point. DI is not the primary way in which we safeguard the interests of depositors, be they small or large. The recent stresses involving banks abroad remind us that a safe and resilient banking system is underpinned most fundamentally by a combination of pre-emptive safeguards. These include sound regulation, rigorous supervision, proactive cross-border cooperation and effective governance and risk management by the banks themselves.",2,94,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00094
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"So, we put a lot of store by these pre-emptive safeguards here in Singapore. They have contributed to MAS' financial sector oversight being assessed to be ""amongst the best globally"" by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the most recent Financial Sector Assessment Programme in 2019. DI complements these pre-emptive or ex-ante safeguards by providing a safety net for small depositors if banks were to fail.",3,95,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00095
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"International regulatory standard setting bodies, like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), will be carefully assessing the regulatory and supervisory implications arising from the recent banking stresses. MAS will be working with other regulators in these reviews in developing any needed regulatory responses to enhance the resilience of our banking system.",4,96,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00096
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Our DI scheme aims to protect small depositors. Its adequacy as a safety net can be assessed by looking at the proportion of depositors who are fully insured – in other words, the depositors whose aggregated eligible deposits at a bank are within the DI coverage limit. The DI coverage limit in Singapore was last raised in 2019 from $50,000 to $75,000 per depositor per participating financial institution. At $75,000, it fully insured 91% of depositors covered under the DI Scheme at the time. With deposit growth since then, the percentage of fully insured depositors has fallen slightly to 89%.",5,97,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00097
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Prior to the recent events, MAS had just concluded its latest, but regular review of the DI scheme, including both the DI coverage limit and also ways to ensure the operational efficacy of the DI scheme. MAS aims to present these proposals for public consultation by the end of June.",6,98,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00098
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"It is worth noting that we are not doing so in response to the recent stresses among some banks abroad and we should avoid overreacting to these events. Our principal objective should be to ensure that the pre-emptive safeguards, which I described earlier, are in good shape. We will also have to adjust the nominal coverage limit for DI from time to time. However, raising the proportion of deposits that are fully insured or, in other words, to cover larger depositors, is not without costs to banks, which will often ultimately mean costs borne by bank customers themselves. Each adjustment to the DI scheme, hence, has to be carefully considered.",7,99,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00099

2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions.

2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Robust stress testing would, of course, help us to highlight any areas of vulnerability of individual banks by incorporating assumptions that are more reflective of a bank's risks.

2023-05-08-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First is in relation to the Minister of State's answer just now. I have a concern with regard to the Minister of State's view and risk assessment in terms of digital bank runs in the future. I think things have evolved significantly since the last FSAP, as the Minister of State mentioned, in 2019. Things have changed in the financial sector and things have evolved in terms of digitalisation in the banking sector. So, what is the Minister of State's view and risk assessment of digital banking runs or, as some people call it, ""bank rush"", in Singapore and in the region?",2,110,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00110
2023-05-08-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second supplementary question, Mr Deputy Speaker, is in regard to raising the DI limit. I am actually mindful of considering the DI limits because it could have cost implications, as the Minister of State mentioned, for the banking sector as well as Singaporeans. If so, what is the cost of this increased DI coverage limit? Is the DI fund adequately sized in terms of the pre-funding? Also, can the Minister of State highlight – typically, in other countries, for example, the UK, it takes seven days for a depositor of a bank to get his or her money cash back. For Singapore, how many days would it take for a depositor to get his money if a bank goes bankrupt?",3,111,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00111
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me go through the different questions one by one.",1,112,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00112
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the Member's question on digital banks, digital full banks are DI members of SDIC. In the initial restricted phase, they are limited to no more than $75,000 deposit per individual depositor. So, at that level, it will mean that all of the individual's deposits with a digital full bank would be fully covered. Digital wholesale banks are not subject to this cap but they cannot take retail deposits.",2,113,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00113
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,On the other question with regard to how fast can you make payments – SDIC's target is to make payments to insured depositors within seven days after the payout is triggered.,3,114,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00114
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the final question on the increase of the DI coverage limit, the DI scheme members pay regular premiums quite similar to what I explained earlier, to cover these deposits; and a higher coverage limit, of course, will require higher premiums. This adds naturally to the bank's overall costs, which they will have to manage themselves, and then, sometimes also pass on these costs to customers, given that they are commercial enterprises. They might do it through, perhaps, lower deposit rates, higher lending rates or other fees.",4,115,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00115
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"But I wanted to go into the final question, which is important, about the size of the DI fund. I would like to assure the Member and Members of this House that the DI fund is adequately sized. It is designed to meet a solvency standard of over 99.9%. What that means is that at this target fund size, the DI fund is able to make DI payments without losses at a confidence interval of 99.9%.",5,116,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00116
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The target fund size is currently calibrated at $690 million and the DI fund has approximately $570 million in total assets and continues to be built up as scheduled, through annual premiums collected by member financial institutions.",6,117,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00117
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The DI fund may also borrow from MAS for payments to insured depositors. But I wanted to quickly come back again to the principle of this  that in a safe, resilient banking system, it is underpinned by a combination of pre-emptive safeguards. I mentioned sound regulation, rigorous supervision, proactive cross-border collaboration, effective governance and the responsibilities of banks themselves.",7,118,2023-05-08-T-006-S-00118
2023-05-08-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"DI complements these pre-emptive and ex-ante safeguards, by providing a safety net for small depositors, if banks were to fail.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a statement on 25 April 2023 stating that the reports were highly misleading and had no credible basis.

He said, and I quote, ""This was simply untrue and not at all what was said in the interview."" He said he had ""never said anything about citizenship"". He said that he did not track citizenship in his research and that his projection referred to high-net-worth individuals moving to Singapore in general, and most of them may be expatriates and work transfers, that is, not necessarily persons who applied for and became citizens.",3,123,2023-05-08-T-007-S-00123
2023-05-08-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"As mentioned in MHA's statement on 25 April 2023, having high net worth does not guarantee Singapore Citizenship. Each Singapore Citizenship application is assessed on a broad range of factors, which include the ability to contribute to Singapore, the number of jobs that the applicant or his business may be able to create in Singapore, the special skillset and/or education that the applicant may possess, the applicant's family ties to Singaporeans, the ability to integrate and the commitment to sink roots in Singapore. Different criteria may apply to different applicants, depending on their background and circumstances. For example, an applicant applying as a spouse of a Singapore Citizen will be considered differently from someone applying on the basis of having stayed in Singapore for a period of time and contributed to employment creation in Singapore.",4,124,2023-05-08-T-007-S-00124

May I ask the Senior Minister of State is the Ministry looking at what are the impediments do that? Why is it so? Is there a need to change the scheme or the policy so that it becomes attractive for patients to use the GP clinics as well, and not all going to the polyclinics?",2,136,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00136

There will be triage, they will be assessed and, if there is an urgent need, they will be attended to. If it is something elective and there are no appointment slots left, the recommendation will be that they seek care electively in a planned way, make an appointment with the GP within the vicinity.",2,138,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00138

Perhaps if there are specific cases, we could look into that and see how we can assist. In general, we are trying to find ways to help the GPs, the family physicians, as a community, upskill and deliver these types of cares in partnership with the polyclinic teams as well.

For the residents in the west, especially in the Nanyang ward, they go to Pioneer Polyclinic. They really have difficulties getting appointments online and, even so, when the residents go to the polyclinic early in the morning to queue for the appointment, they cannot get an appointment.",1,141,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00141
2023-05-08-T-009,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"So, my supplementary question is, one  when they queue, if they cannot get an appointment, can they get the next day's appointment? Two, we also understand that most of the polyclinics and the MOH building are in other parts of Singapore, in the north-west part or the western part, and not in the Jurong area. So, how are we going to alleviate the situation at Pioneer Polyclinic?",2,142,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00142
2023-05-08-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his questions. We will look at his suggestion in terms of the queuing system and the appointment booking process. We are trying very hard to improve the service provision for primary care by both expanding our network of polyclinics, as well as leveraging on the experience and capability of the GP clinics and family physicians that are in the community and that can serve this resident population very well.",1,143,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00143

2023-05-08-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Can the Senior Minister of State consider asking polyclinics to consider prioritising walk-in patients who are seniors? Because Ms Joan Pereira is very particularly interested in making sure our seniors walking in, as well as those with mobility issues, are attended to, given that they may find it challenging to go to the GPs. I think the Senior Minister of State has highlighted it somewhere at the beginning, but I think it is very, very focused on seniors – whether there could be prioritising for them, especially those who are very aged and have mobility issues.",2,146,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00146
2023-05-08-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Saktiandi Supaat for asking that question. As I mentioned in my original answer, the walk-in residents, the walk-in patients are triaged and assessed, and part of that assessment will, indeed, be their state of frailty, and their age and their mobility are considered as part of that assessment.",1,147,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00147
2023-05-08-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I think the right thing to do is to allow the professional judgement of the clinical team at the site to make the assessment as to the urgency of their needs, rather than set a very arbitrary cut-off in terms of an age, for example, or other factors where actually the key thing is to assess the needs of that patient at that time. And that is, indeed, what the clinical services will do. I thank the Members for their question.",2,148,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00148

For his first supplementary question, I do not have the data with me about the proportions of seniors that are attending now as compared to historical data. I would be happy to provide it if he would like to file a separate Parliamentary Question. But, in general, as I engage with the polyclinic staff and the clinicians who provide these services, it is quite clear that a very high proportion of their workload is, indeed, the seniors. And so, the senior residents within the geographical area are, indeed, attending, are able to access the services and receive the care from the polyclinic care teams. But as I said, I would be happy to look at the data, specifically, if he would like to file a related question.",1,153,2023-05-08-T-009-S-00153

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) evaluate occupations for the Complementarity Assessment Framework or COMPASS' Shortage Occupation List (SOL) based on three criteria  the first criterion being the strategic importance of the occupation to Singapore’s economic priorities; second, the degree and nature of labour shortage; and third, the sector’s commitment to developing the local pipeline to address these shortages.",1,159,2023-05-08-T-010-S-00159

We derive this data from MOM's Job Vacancy Survey, as well as data from the MyCareersFuture job portal on job applications and vacancies. We also supplement this with qualitative assessments from the relevant sector agencies, alongside feedback and ground sensing from industry and tripartite partners. Together, this provides a good degree of triangulation. It provides MOM and MTI with a fuller understanding of labour market shortage conditions in the respective industries.",2,160,2023-05-08-T-010-S-00160
2023-05-08-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The SOL does not stand alone as a strategy to meet industry demand for skilled professionals. While the SOL helps companies access foreign professionals to plug immediate skills gaps and seize economic opportunities, it must also be complemented by robust efforts by industry to train up and place locals into these well-paying jobs. Hence, there must be clear plans, clear commitments by industry to develop the local pipeline, or else the occupation will not be included in the SOL.",3,161,2023-05-08-T-010-S-00161
2023-05-08-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To Mr Liang Eng Hwa’s question on tracking of commitments to develop the local pipeline, MOM and MTI work closely with sector agencies to set commitments around local training as well as employment at the aggregate occupation level. Rather than mandating fixed commitments for each firm, sector agencies have the flexibility to work closely with the firms, industry partners and education and training providers on plans to train and employ more locals with these skills in shortage. We will review that these commitments are met, as a key condition for renewing an occupation on the SOL.",4,162,2023-05-08-T-010-S-00162

This will start on a fresh slate every three years so that we do not entrench any particular dependencies in any occupation.",2,170,2023-05-08-T-010-S-00170

I understand that the bus stop codes and names are displayed at the bus stop pole and the bus stop information board. However, the font that is used is relatively small and it is not easily visible to passengers as they are approaching the bus stop. So, it would not give them enough time to be able to press the button to indicate to the bus captain to stop the bus. In fact, the most prominent signage at the bus stop is actually the bus shelter address plate, which is on the top of the bus shelter because the font can be seen from quite a distance away, about 40 metres away at least, in my estimation.

2023-05-08-T-013,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Education (a) to what extent do primary schools at the annual Primary 1 registration ensure the racial make-up of their students is reflective of Singapore's society; and (b) what measures do schools take to ensure that their students may effectively learn through peer interactions about the lived experiences of different racial and religious groups.,1,198,2023-05-08-T-013-S-00198
2023-05-08-T-013,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Second Minister for Education (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Primary 1 (P1) Registration Framework balances a number of factors, including the convenience of having the younger sibling attend the same school as the older sibling, proximity to home or ties that the parents have with the school. Within this framework, parental choice during the P1 Registration Exercise impacts the social profile of students in our primary schools.",1,199,2023-05-08-T-013-S-00199
2023-05-08-T-013,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Second Minister for Education (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for Education),"In primary schools, students learn about living in a multicultural society through a range of subjects. In Character and Citizenship Education, students learn about the major cultures in Singapore, as well as ways to relate to people of different races and religions. In Social Studies, students explore the contributions of different racial communities in the past and how Singapore’s past shaped the racial and religious diversity today. Students also learn the importance of respecting and appreciating the different cultures. Schools also celebrate different cultural festivals and organise learning journeys to museums, cultural and heritage sites to develop a better understanding of peers from different races and religions in Singapore.",2,200,2023-05-08-T-013-S-00200

2023-05-08-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the recent rise in rental prices of commercial properties have affected Singapore’s competitiveness and attractiveness as a business destination of choice; and (b) whether more can be done to moderate further rental increases.,1,214,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00214
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Deputy Speaker, globally, inflation has stayed elevated and the cost of doing business, which includes rental prices, has also increased. The rental index of office spaces in Singapore has increased by an average of about 1.35% per annum in the last three years. While rental for office spaces is higher than the pre-pandemic level, it remains below historical peaks in 2008 and 2015. In the same period, the vacancy rate for office spaces has remained stable at around 11% to 13%.",1,215,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00215
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Between 2023 and 2025, more than 530,000 square metres of office space is expected to be completed. This is about 40% higher, compared to the past three years combined, and can help to cater to the demand and moderate rent increases over time. Rental continues to comprise a modest proportion of overall business costs for most sectors in Singapore. The Government will continue to monitor the market. We are committed to ensuring Singapore’s competitiveness and attractiveness as a business destination.",2,216,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00216

2023-05-08-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I would like to further ask the Minister of State whether she can share the insights as to how the Government intends to calibrate the supply of commercial spaces. In particular, can she elaborate on the 530,000 square metres of office space that are in the pipleline? Where will this space be located and what kind of businesses would they cater for?",1,218,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00218
2023-05-08-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The second question is  the Minister of State mentioned in her reply that rentals form a modest proportion of the business costs for most sectors. I think, to some, it is still quite significant. Can I ask how would the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) ensure that Singapore remains overall competitive to be able to attract investments to Singapore with a rental that is reasonable and affordable to those companies?",2,219,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00219
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa for his three supplementary questions.

2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To the first part of his first supplementary question, that is, to moderate the commercial rental prices, Mr Liang and Members will know that the Government has, in the past, implemented various supply-side measures, for example, calibrating sufficient supply to meet longer-term demand through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. I will give Members a quick example. Just a few months ago, in December last year, the Government announced a mixed-use site at Jurong Lake District that is potentially yielding about 150,000 square metres of commercial space and that will be released via the confirmed list in June 2023.",3,222,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00222

I cite all these examples to share and give assurance to the Member that these sites can be triggered by the developers to cater for additional commercial space demands. So, that is one.",4,223,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00223
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"And, of course, another important data to look at is the vacancy rate and I cited the figures of 11% to 13%.",5,224,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00224
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"If I hear correctly, the second part of the Member's first question is about whether I can give some breakdown to the 530,000 square metres. Sir, I cited earlier that in the next three years, starting from this year, we will see about 530,000 square metres of commercial space being completed and this figure represents 40% higher, compared to the last three years combined.",6,225,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00225
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"And to cater to companies in different sectors with different locational preferences, new office spaces will be distributed geographically across the island. I will cite some quick examples.",7,226,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00226
2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In the Central Business District (CBD) area, for example, this year, we will see the completion of the IOI Central Boulevard and that will yield 139,000 square metres.",8,227,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00227

2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To the Member's second question about Singapore's overall competitiveness, he would have read some of the recent ranking reports, including the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

2023-05-08-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"More importantly, I think the point here is that Singapore does not compete on cost alone. Other factors that contribute to our city state's overall competitiveness include a stable political regime, strong rule of law, favourable policy towards foreign investment and trade, good digital and logistic connectivity, a skilled workforce as well as our technological infrastructure. But I want to reassure Mr Liang and all Members that the Government will certainly continue to monitor the market closely and, where needed, calibrate the supply of commercial properties to ensure the stability as well as the sustainability of rentals for business over the medium to long term.",14,233,2023-05-08-T-015-S-00233

2023-05-08-T-016,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister),"Sir, the scenario Dr Tan described is quite rare  where an unauthorised bank transaction took place and where the bank assessed that the One-Time Password (OTP) SMS messaging was used, but that the customer's telephone operator records did not show transmission to or receipt by the customer of such an SMS OTP. The Singapore Police Force has not received any such report since 2021. The Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) is aware of two cases since July 2022 where the use or receipt of SMS OTP by the customer is disputed.",1,236,2023-05-08-T-016-S-00236

2023-05-08-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, what is the process for handling disputes where the bank has assessed, based on their own records, that SMS OTP was used to validate the transaction, especially if the bank says SMS OTP by definition means it was legitimate, yet the customer is able to provide evidence, testimony from the telco that may suggest a different assessment of what happened? Is there a process for having this review besides FIDReC or does the bank have the final say on this question?",2,242,2023-05-08-T-016-S-00242
2023-05-08-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, can I also ask the Minister of State what is being done to prepare not just for the last war on scams but the next one?",3,243,2023-05-08-T-016-S-00243
2023-05-08-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"A year ago, in February 2022, I asked in Parliament about the risk of emerging deepfake audio and video calls. Since then, there have been potential cases in the United States of deepfake audio voice calls. Can I ask the Minister whether the proposed equitable framework for sharing of losses will look at such emerging risks and will it also consider my previous suggestion on the difference between a customer making a forced error – for example, with a deepfake – versus an unforced error?",4,244,2023-05-08-T-016-S-00244

2023-05-08-T-016,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Let me take the second one with regard to the rapidly evolving nature of scams and the use of new technologies. We know that the techniques employed by scammers are constantly evolving and also gaining in sophistication with the use of differentiated technologies and this also thus requires a multi-pronged response across our ecosystem to strengthen our collective mechanisms and resilience against scams. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will continue to work closely with our ecosystem partners, including the banking industry and other Government agencies. For example, MAS is working with banks to allow customers to verify genuine calls from banks. Banks are also exploring expanding the use of biometric technology with liveness test in addition to passwords and OTP as a means of authentication.",2,246,2023-05-08-T-016-S-00246
2023-05-08-T-016,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,Members of the public can also play their part.

Roads occupy 12% of our land, compared to around 13% for industry and 15% for housing.",3,261,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00261
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Our land transport system accounts for about 15% of Singapore's total domestic carbon emissions. We must make it much more sustainable as part of the national effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Pre-COVID-19, about 14 million journeys were made every day, across four modes – public transport, point-to-point transport, private vehicles and active mobility. That is the scale of the challenge.",4,262,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00262

2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"The best way to achieve this is through mass public transport. It allows the greatest number of people to get to their destinations with the least land take and carbon emissions. Our rail network serves around three million journeys a day and takes up less than 1% of our total surface area. In contrast, roads take up 12% of our land, for seven million journeys. This includes those made by cars, motorcycles, buses as well as private hire cars (PHCs). Compared to driving an internal combustion engine car, taking the train reduces our carbon footprint by 90%.",6,264,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00264

Today, seven in 10 households are within a 10-minute walk of one of our 202 Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) stations. By the next decade, it will be eight in 10 households. To achieve this, we are building an additional 100 kilometres (km) of rail, almost a 40% increase from our current rail network. By 2035, we will have eight MRT lines and two LRT lines, interconnected and reaching all parts of the island.",7,265,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00265

Today, all our MRT stations and bus interchanges, as well as 98% of our bus stops, are barrier-free and the work is ongoing.

Shared transport, which includes both taxis and PHCs, providing point-to-point (P2P) passenger transport services, complements mass public transport. They provide a useful alternative to car ownership for those who may need access to car-like services, whether chauffeured or self-driving. Today, the P2P sector accounts for around one million daily journeys, up from 800,000 in 2012.",12,270,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00270

As a proportion of the total car population, PHCs have remained at around 10% for the past four years. In fact, the period where we saw the fastest growth in PHC numbers was between 2015 and 2017, where they increased from 30,000 to almost 70,000. There was no commensurate upward pressure on COE prices in that period. Conversely, while COE prices have been rising over the past several quarters, demand from PHC companies has, in fact, been moderating.",14,272,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00272

2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"The VQS fundamentally works through supply and demand forces to efficiently allocate a scarce resource – COEs. The system also incorporates progressivity considerations by having different COE categories. In fact, when the COE system first started in 1990, there were four categories for cars. The number of categories was reduced to the current two in 1999 to address concerns over the relatively small quota supply and resultant volatility as well as limited choices of cars in some categories. Category E (Cat E), which is the Open category, was retained to allow for changing preferences and needs in vehicle types over time.",20,278,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00278
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Mr Liang Eng Hwa has asked if there are plans to review the COE system. On the whole, the system continues to serve our policy objective of efficiently allocating the limited supply of COEs. However, over the years, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and LTA have made various refinements to the VQS scheme to ensure its relevance and efficacy without forsaking the core policy intent. The power rating criterion of 97 kilowatt (kW) was introduced in 2014 for the mass market Cat A, so that car COE categories are differentiated not just by engine capacity. Last year, as more electric car models became available in Singapore, we increased the power output threshold for Cat A COEs to 110 kilowatt hour (kWh) in order to accommodate mass market electric cars.",21,279,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00279

In other words, if I can put it the other way, Cat B OMVs in the median is about 75% higher compared to the median in Cat A. So, there is a clear differentiation although it may not be a complete dichotomisation of the market. We will continue to monitor and review the differentiating criteria between Categories A and B as the technology evolves.",22,280,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00280
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Ms Mariam Jafaar and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about Cat D COEs for motorcycles. A key feature of the motorcycle market is that dealers bid and hold the temporary COEs (TCOEs) in their own name before transferring it to a motorcycle buyer. This is a deliberate design feature because it provides convenience for buyers who can readily purchase a motorcycle. This is unlike the car market where bids are primarily in the name of the buyer. The prospective car buyers who need immediate access to a car and, in other words, a bid was not submitted in their name, can rely on Cat E COEs where there is some flexibility.",23,281,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00281
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"As I explained at my Ministry’s Committee of Supply (COS) debate this year, about 450 Cat D TCOEs that were secured when prices were close to or above $13,000, were subsequently left to expire when COE prices fell. To Ms Mariam Jaafar’s query, the expired TCOEs were held by more than 50 dealers; and of course, those with a bigger market share contributed more, but there is a spread. The TCOE utilisation rates subsequently went back up, with the market correcting when it could not support the prevailing prices. This is what we mean by the market working as intended. In other words, it responds to price signals, upwards or downwards, and then there is a re-allocation.",24,282,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00282

2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Ms Joan Pereira asked about the impact of foreigners. I know this is a common query. The proportion of car COEs secured by foreigners remains low and has not changed significantly over the years. As I shared in January this year, from July 2020 to December 2022, on average, less than 3% of car COEs were allocated to foreigners. This number has remained stable.",27,285,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00285
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Another common query – there is no specific PQ on this, but I know it is on many Members' minds and elsewhere – is about multiple-car owning households. In November last year, I had shared with this House that as of 31 October 2022, of the 471,000 households that own cars – and that is about 36% of all households in Singapore – 12% own two cars, and less than 3% own three or more cars. The percentages remain about the same today. In fact, over the past decade, the proportion of multiple-car owning households has been steadily declining from about 19% of households in 2012 to less than 15% today.",28,286,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00286

So, it is actually quite difficult to establish a causal relationship between such car shows and promotions with COE prices.",30,288,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00288
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"So, what then is the cause of rising COE prices?",31,289,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00289
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Fundamentally, the COE prices reflect demand for a limited supply of COEs. This is further accentuated or exacerbated by the fact that we are now at a trough in the 10-year cycle of COE supply.",32,290,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00290
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Demand in all categories has remained resilient, especially as the economy recovers from post-COVID-19. Incomes have also been rising over the long term. As was observed in Prof Raymond Ong’s article in The Straits Times on 7 May 2023, the ratio of COE prices to median monthly household income has fallen from 11 to one during the previous COE price peak in 2013 to nine is to one today. So, in comparison to median income, the COE price is actually lower – although in absolute terms, the price has risen. And the reason is because household incomes have risen. As household incomes continue to rise in the coming years, coupled with our policy of zero-growth in the car population, we must expect the long-term trajectory for COE prices to be upwards.",33,291,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00291
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"COE supply, in turn, is determined primarily by car de-registrations in preceding quarters, which have been relatively low of late. Over the past few months, MOT has made several moves to reduce volatility in quota supply. Instead of just the preceding quarter, we first adopted the average of the preceding two quarters in August last year and now use the moving average of de-registrations in the four preceding quarters to compute COE quotas for the next quarter. These moves have helped to mitigate quarter-on-quarter volatility.",34,292,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00292
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"We also expect the COE supply to start increasing substantially in the coming months as more cars reach the 10-year mark.

2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Consequently, as a one-off exercise, LTA will bring forward and redistribute the supply from five-year COEs which are due to expire in the next projected supply peak. As these five-year COEs cannot be extended and, therefore, have to be de-registered, LTA will be able to identify the exact number with certainty. This supply will be redistributed over several quarters starting from the next bidding exercise. This move will increase quota supply in the next bidding exercise by about 24% in Cat A and 15% in Cat B. LTA will release more details shortly.",36,294,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00294
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Even as we make this move, I would like to emphasise two points. First, this will help to lessen, but it will not eliminate, volatility in supply. There will still be a degree of supply fluctuation due to historical factors and also broader market conditions. Secondly, the long-term upward trend of COE prices due to rising incomes and zero vehicle population growth will not abate.",37,295,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00295

2023-05-08-T-018,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"First, would MOT consider a pay-as-you-bid system instead of people bidding higher and then paying for the lowest rate? Second, can we disallow financing of COE, which means that when you take a loan, it has to be only the car loan and not the COE? The COE has to be paid in cash.",2,300,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00300
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, if there is one thing I have learnt in my short time in MOT, there is no shortage of creativity in the suggestions made to improve the COE system. I thank the Member for his suggestions.",1,301,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00301
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But if I may, say, first, a pay-as-you-bid system, I understand the motivation behind it. But if I may offer Members the counterpoint – the problem then is you create a great deal of variation in the market. For the same car bought in the same exercise, the value may be quite different because one bids higher and one bids lower.",2,302,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00302
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I do not want to get into a long discussion on this, but from an auction theory perspective and so on, actually the method we use is probably the most efficient. So, I would say that that is not the source of the problem. Let us diagnose this correctly. The issue is not the system or how it is being administered per se. The issue is really around supply and some level of volatility that we are trying to mitigate, as well as where we can or where we discern some need to intervene because of either speculation or some inefficiencies in the market. And that is what we have sought to do.",3,303,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00303
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The second point on financing, I would say I think it is a question that should be put to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), frankly, or the authorities. But if I may just offer Members this perspective. A COE and the car are indivisible, really. A standalone COE is of little value until it is applied to register a car. So, one needs to look at it in totality first.",4,304,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00304
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, if you look at it from the point of view of the cost of buying a car, which then you are seeking to finance, I think most financial institutions will look at it as a whole – the value of the car, the market price, including the COE price. So, that is why the system runs as it is. Again, I want to go back to the point that I am not sure that decoupling the financing is going to be the solution to the current set of concerns that Members have.",5,305,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00305

2023-05-08-T-018,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"My first question to the Minister is, I think he mentioned that the reason why COE prices are higher is because of high demand and limited supply. But I would like to ask the Minister whether another reason why COE prices may be at this level, this recent wave, is because of the disparity in the purchasing power among the bidders. In other words, there are, in each batch of the COE bidding, more bidders that have higher purchasing power and, therefore, the ability to pay up; and that is where the COE prices are. So, I would like to ask whether that is desirable.",1,307,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00307
2023-05-08-T-018,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The second question is whether some amount of allocation by balloting, like how we do for housing, can be part of the solution as well.",2,308,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00308
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank Mr Liang for his questions. I am not sure what the Member means by disparity in purchasing power. Because, as I explained earlier, overall, if you look at it over a 10-year cycle, peak to peak, our incomes have risen. And to the extent that cars remain an aspirational product or a necessity, then you must expect that there will be a propensity to want to allocate the budget to buy that and the prices will reflect, to some extent, the trends in incomes as well. That is why I gave the numbers that I did. That is not to say that that is the only factor but, generally, if you compare it to incomes rising and so on, I think that does tell us an important story.",1,309,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00309
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, I would say that in terms of ownership – I stressed this point and I would like to make it again – we have 470,000 households in Singapore that own cars. That is about 36% to 37% – so, it is a very sizeable proportion of our population base. So, what we have been trying to do is, through a combination of ownership and usage measures, make cars available as widely as possible, but within our zero-growth constraint, which we have imposed for good reasons. And that will continue to be the basis.",2,310,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00310
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member's second point was on balloting some amount. I am very sure all the Members here will be able to offer perspectives on it, but let me just deal with this. If we say a proportion of COEs are balloted and the rest are not, then the question is  so, we have a market where you bid and you secure; and then, there is another segment which is by luck of the draw, literally. How do we price that? Do you price it at the same price as the COE in that period? Or do you say no, it is a discounted price. If it is a discounted price, then it is a windfall for the party that gets this, because they will then be able to resell the car with the COE at a higher price because the market clearing price is higher. Then, the question is  what justifies such a ballot, who qualifies and how do we do it?",3,311,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00311
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I am just sharing this with Members because I appreciate the intent behind the suggestion, but I am trying to point out that there are several, quite intractable, second- and third-order issues we will have to deal with. And we will very quickly move from discussing COE prices to wondering why the balloting system is not working. And, indeed, we do have discussions like that in this House as well. So, a balloting system is not a panacea. In fact, it may aggravate the problems, if the concern is around price and unevenness in the market.",4,312,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00312

Factors that will persuade the car owners to switch – there are several and I have talked about some of them. The most important thing that we need to do is to populate the spectrum of commuting choices available to Singaporeans. The more we are able to offer a high-quality public transport system and near-car kind of services, whether it is car sharing, your P2Ps and so on, and if we can also make the first-mile last-mile part of the commute a better one, then I think people who choose to pay the sum that they pay, or the sums that they pay to buy a car, will have reason to take a pause and re-evaluate the choices that they make.",1,316,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00316

What we are really trying to do is to make the alternatives as compelling as possible. In fact, you hear this more from people who have lived overseas and come here. I was recently at an American Chamber of Commerce dialogue. And one of the ladies said she came from the US where she was wholly reliant on her car. She was waxing lyrical about our public transport system. Her teenage daughter who studied here, used our public transport system, has since gone to the US for her further studies in Houston. According to her, the daughter laments that the public transport system in the US is not of the same quality and accessibility as here.",2,317,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00317
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we do have advocates and I am very keen to get more of such advocates, especially Singaporeans. And we do have. Many Singaporeans have told us that they really like the fact that we have a good public transport system. Of course, there are always areas we can improve.",3,318,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00318
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"That is also why I cited the survey – there is a perceptible shift in the preferences of the younger generation of Singaporeans. They are more adept at using technology and some of the solutions already available. As a result, they are less seized with the need to buy a car. In fact, they think there are other ways of using their money. And I say, good for them, in that regard.",4,319,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00319
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Single- to double-decker buses, I do not have the exact numbers. But I will put it this way – the move for sustainability is the thrust of the Member's question. The main way we are seeking to ensure sustainability is through electrification. We have about 6,000 buses in the public bus fleet. And about half of these will be electric by 2030; the other half will be a hybrid solution. So, that is how we are moving.",5,320,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00320
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In terms of single- and double-decker buses, a lot of that is actually a function of capacity planning, based on the routes and the kind of demand. This can vary, depending on how commuter behaviour changes over time.",6,321,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00321
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa.,1,322,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00322
2023-05-08-T-018,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Would the Minister consider alternative ways of allocating the vehicle quota based on other factors, instead of just price alone? For example, maybe a point-based system, where apart from the bidding price, we also consider other factors like nationality, and needs-based factors, like families with young children or persons with disability.",1,323,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00323
2023-05-08-T-018,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, would the Minister consider, in the same way as we have the Additional Buyers' Stamp Duty (ABSD) for the purchase of second or more residential properties, would the Minister consider an additional levy on additional vehicle purchase?",2,324,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00324
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The Member has raised a few questions. Let me try and deal with them.,1,325,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00325
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"A point-based system – it is really a variation of the idea that Mr Liang Eng Hwa talked about, a ballot. Because in the end, you have got to decide how you would allocate the points, on what basis? And how will that then factor into the final COE allocation? Does that mean that if someone has got more points, then they are entitled to a different price when it comes to the COE? Or does it mean that they go into a different pool? And if they go into a different pool, how do we segment the pools?",2,326,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00326
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I think a point-based system has, in a sense, the kind of arbitrariness that we are trying to avoid. We are trying to let the market work itself through. We do have schemes where we help people – for example, those who have special needs or persons with disability who need vehicles for, say, work and so on, we do have schemes to help them with that, including with the COEs and so on.",3,327,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00327
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Those are very targeted measures that we can do, but that is best achieved not by tinkering with the COE allocation system, but by, instead, trying to defray some, if not all, of the cost impact on certain groups.",4,328,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00328
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"It is not unlike what we do, for example, for electricity in Singapore. We price electricity fully. We do not subsidise it. We do not say ""first hundred units X, next hundred units Y"". We price it all the same, because every one, from the beginning, is a unit of electricity. But then what we do is that we provide U-Save rebates and so on. So, if we want to help certain categories of people, it is best to do it that way.",5,329,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00329
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Then, the Member makes a point about needs-based. And I am quite sympathetic to her point, because many families say to me  ""Look, I have got children and I need to take them around to enrichment classes on the weekends and so on, and public transport does not quite work for me"". And then, we have others who say  ""Look, I have got elderly parents whom I need to take to hospital or for medical appointments"" and so on. I think if you look at households in Singapore, they will either have children or elderly parents they have to look after and that will probably cover most households in Singapore.",6,330,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00330
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, everyone has a need that I think we can understand. The real question for us is  do we have the resources and the capacity to meet that need effectively? That is where the challenge lies. I mean, I would be very happy if we had a cornucopia of COEs that we can just dispense at will. But we do not, because of the constraints I have highlighted. And that is why we have to make some tough choices in the allocative sense.",7,331,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00331
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, we are working on and, in fact, we do have some alternatives, as I have said, for persons with disability and so on, we have got certain targeted measures. Also, car-sharing services, because these allow households to have a car for a few hours to do what they need to do and then come back and leave the car for somebody else to use. So, that actually is a more efficient outcome and, in fact, it would save households a lot more money than buying a car and incurring the depreciation. That is one of the things we are doing and we will do more.",8,332,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00332
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Also, some of the P2P operators, like Grab and so on, they offer chauffeured services where you can do block booking by time. For example, if you want to take your parents to hospital you think it will take you four hours or whatever, you can make those sorts of bookings as well.",9,333,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00333
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, there are other solutions in place and I would say that that is something we should keep in mind.",10,334,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00334
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As far as the idea of ABSD is concerned, I have already pointed out clearly that the COE price that we see today is not explained by multiple car-owning households. They have actually been quite constant throughout. The question is  what is the problem we are trying to fix here? Because you may come up with the tool, it may be a very popular move, but does it really address the problem at its root?",11,335,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00335
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.,1,336,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00336
2023-05-08-T-018,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for sharing the Statement earlier, especially about the release of the five-year COE supply and also the measures taken by LTA over the past few months about the deposits and all that. It has actually helped, in terms of price recovery and microstructure.",1,337,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00337
2023-05-08-T-018,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I got two clarifications, Deputy Speaker.",2,338,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00338
2023-05-08-T-018,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, in relation to our transition to move away from and finding alternatives to private car ownership, the Minister mentioned just now about enhancing the alternatives of P2Ps, PHCs and taxis going forward. My question is that as we still have Singaporeans aspiring to own cars and we are trying to go car-lite, I think these are the sorts of issues that I am hearing from the Minister's Statement, we are not moving away from them anytime soon – car-lite, zero-growth, we are a very small country and the push is towards public transport. That is clear, Minister.",3,339,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00339
2023-05-08-T-018,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, the question is the transition. There is going to be a time transition for people to move away from their aspirations. My question is  if you go towards the holistic approach or to the car-lite strategy and zero-growth, how can we improve our P2P, PHC and taxi services? Because the exasperation of Singaporeans on the ground, if they want to move away from a private car, but they have to wait for taxis and PHCs and these are not there, every single minute when they want to have access to it, 24 hours of the day and at any time, is something that will need to be addressed. That is my first question, Minister.",4,340,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00340
2023-05-08-T-018,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, I would like to get some clarification with regard to the five-year COE supply in terms of the numbers and what is the direction or thought trends going forward beyond the existing three to six months this year and probably into the many years ahead.",5,341,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00341
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I thank the Member for his questions.,1,342,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00342
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, just to address one other point about ABSD that was raised. If the Member's intent is that we should have progressivity in the COE system, actually, we already have significant progressivity through the tax system, the ARF system that we have today, in terms of cars. In fact, the Finance Minister announced a whole set of moves to further increase the gradient and the progressivity.",2,343,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00343
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I think those who are buying cars are actually going to be paying more and, especially if they are buying higher value cars or more expensive cars, they end up paying a higher amount in taxes as well.",3,344,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00344
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On Mr Saktiandi's points, first, whether we can do more to increase the supply of the P2P, the private hire cars – and we use all these terms interchangeably – and taxis and so on. The bottom line is that we need to try all measures to enhance the availability of car-like – not car-lite – but car-like services. Because what people really value is the flexibility to be able to hop into a car and go to multiple locations in a certain period of time and come back. But it is a waste to have the car sitting in the carpark when you are not using it for hours, when you only need it maybe a few hours in a week. That is the crux of it.",4,345,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00345
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we need to find more alternatives and that is what LTA and MOT are working on what we can do in terms of more in the P2P sector and the PHCs. I have a smile on my face because the Member is asking for whether we can do more and have more PHCs. I think I have just heard from others advocating quite the opposite. So, you understand the conundrum, I think.",5,346,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00346
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But the bottom line is, car for car – if I take a car away from private ownership and we put it in the P2P sector – it will benefit more people, at least, as a first principle. Then, there are all the issues we need to deal with in terms of policy.",6,347,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00347
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we are working on a whole range of ideas on this, how we can do more. And I accept the Member's point that there is a transition. The transition is not just in terms of going to car-lite, but also because it would take us at least about 10 years more before our MRT system comes to that level where we really have good connectivity in many parts. We already have pretty good connectivity, by the way; but this will take it at least a notch higher and we will be comparable to the best cities in the world.",7,348,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00348
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the key thing is to manage the transition. And as I said, it is about populating the choice spectrum, giving people a whole range of options from public transport at one end to private car ownership on the other, and everything in between. I think the more we can populate that choice spectrum and give people the information and the convenience to exercise that choice, then we are on the right path.",8,349,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00349
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the five-year COE supply, I think the Member's question is how it will be redistributed. And it is not just for one or two quarters because LTA will be releasing more information. Essentially, we have got five-year COEs that will expire probably in about three- or four-years' time and that is when you are really going to know, if you look at the historical cycles, there is going to be a sort of peak-ish. If you go on the basis that everybody who is reaching their 10-year mark is going to de-register, then you are going to be at a peak.",9,350,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00350
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, that is where LTA is basically extracting the five-year COEs from. And these will be redeployed – in not just this quarter, the next quarter but in the next few quarters at least, leading up to this. Because, essentially, it is, as one of my colleagues put it, a cut-and-fill exercise. You are really trying to smoothen the curve, try and avoid too sharp a gradient and, worse, the volatility, the ups and downs. That is what we are trying to do.",10,351,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00351
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But I want to emphasise again  this is not about therefore expecting prices to ease and that is the measure of success. The objective here is to smoothen the supply, reduce the volatility so that people can then make their choices. I have put out the information and I think car buyers as well as car dealers, based on that, I am sure their behaviour and the next and subsequent bidding rounds will be informed by this data.",11,352,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00352
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms Mariam Jaafar.,1,353,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00353
2023-05-08-T-018,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"I thank the Minister. I have two clarifications. One is on motorcycle COEs. I think the Minister will know I have spoken on this a number of times, including on 1 March where I asked for more measures to deter speculative bidding. And I think what the Minister mentioned about the main measures suggests that he now recognises that, beyond supply and demand, speculative behaviour by dealers who have the incentives to bid up prices actually is a factor, and especially so, it is amplified in a market where we are talking about a few hundred COEs every month.",1,354,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00354
2023-05-08-T-018,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"And I think what sits with us is that we all feel that it is particularly egregious when the people who bear the brunt of these actions by dealers, are people who are the lowest income workers, students who are holding part-time jobs because they need to earn.",2,355,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00355
2023-05-08-T-018,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"I guess my clarification is, can we do more to close down these loopholes a bit faster? How can we be more responsive? One suggestion could be – I mean $200, $800, $1,500, it is a bit arbitrary. Could we tie the dealer deposits to the size of their bids, to be a bit quicker to rein in speculative bidding? Two, could we allow for individuals to bid, like we have for cars, for motorcycles also? And three, is there a way to provide more transparency on individual dealer bidding practices?",3,356,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00356
2023-05-08-T-018,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"My second clarification is on car COEs this time. The Minister mentioned that they are currently still studying the impact of PHCs on COE prices. So, I want to just clarify, is there no evidence? Does the Minister feel that there is no evidence today that the PHCs are driving up COE prices? I mean the market works, but it is also not a level playing field as we know. They have ways to pass on higher prices and also the ability to convert some of these PHCs into private cars, although, of course, there is a market for that.",4,357,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00357
2023-05-08-T-018,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"So, how can we close down some of these loopholes? Do they actually exist today? How many cars are converted from PHCs to private cars by these platform companies as an option? And can that be closed down as a low-hanging fruit?",5,358,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00358
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank the Member for her questions. First, I want to just be very clear. The Member suggested that the moves we make affirm or confirm that there has been speculative behaviour and that that is what is causing the prices to go up. That is not quite what I said. So, let me just repeat that clearly.",1,359,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00359
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The fact is the market has already been functioning and the way we know that is when the price goes up, as it did in some of the earlier cycles when the COE price for motorcycles went up to $13,000; and subsequently it came down, the market corrected. And how did it correct? Well, those who were left with very expensive COEs realised that they cannot sell the motorcycles with those COEs and they then had to give up the COEs or they forfeited them. And we then have to recycle that into the market.",2,360,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00360
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What happens then is, just to be very clear, before we made the latest move, such as the reduction of the validity period, was that the supply that is forfeited cannot be returned to the market until the next quarter. So, there is a lag of at least 10 to 12 weeks before it goes back. And what we wanted to do was to re-channel quicker. So, we shortened the validity period and then the motorcycle dealers can decide what they want.",3,361,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00361
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Similarly, I do not think – whether it is $800 or $1,500, they are not arbitrary. I beg to differ with the Member.",4,362,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00362
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"If you take $1,500, for example, it is something like – well, at least before this recent correction which may or may not be sustained – but it is about 10% or so and it is of a similar order of magnitude to what we have for COEs for cars. So, there is a certain method in it. Why do we exercise restraint and caution in raising the bid deposit? Simply because, precisely what the Member says. If we inadvertently, through our policy moves, because deposits are very high, cause motorcycle prices to rise even further, then it will harm precisely the group that the Member wants to help.",5,363,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00363
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,And that is why we have been cautious about the way we have done this. We may not be as fast as some would have liked but I think the yoke of being in Government and in LTA and MOT is that you have to exercise judgement and decide not just what to do but also how much and when. And this is what has eventuated in what we are doing now.,6,364,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00364
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Can there be individual bids? The answer is yes, there can be. But the market practice, in general, is that motorcycle buyers have a preference to just be able to go in and buy in the shops. This is why we have had this arrangement for motorcycle dealers. But there is nothing really that stops us from accommodating this and, in fact, we do already.",7,365,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00365
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On PHCs, is there no evidence of PHCs driving up prices? Well, I would like to draw the Member's attention to what I said in my Ministerial Statement. Basically, in the period, for example, 2015 to 2017, when the PHC population grew from 30,000 to 70,000 or nearly 70,000, so doubling, the impact on COE prices was not particularly discernible. At least I do not recall it. I was not in MOT then, but there were not a lot of questions about it.",8,366,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00366
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"By the same token, and conversely, over the last several quarters and years, COE prices have been rising but, actually, PHC demand or the number of COEs PHCs have secured has actually been moderating. So, I do not think you can make an argument ex ante that there is a causality.",9,367,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00367
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I understand that we are unhappy when prices go up. But let us not be too quick to conclude what the causes are and, therefore, start fixing problems that may not really be at the root of the issue.",10,368,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00368
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But having said that, I concede the point to the Member that the fact is, it is new and that is why I said what I said in my Statement. PHCs are a relatively new phenomenon and it is a very variegated terrain. It is not just your Grabs; you have got your car-sharing guys, you have got the rental guys who then lease to the drivers and so on. So, there is a whole variety. So, it is important that we understand this correctly before we decide whether there is a need to act because they have an impact that perhaps distorts a market and then, if so, then what are those targeted measures. And that is what MOT and LTA are studying.",11,369,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00369

2023-05-08-T-018,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have some quick clarifications pertaining to public transport. In the new fare adjustment formula, how is the productivity contribution quantum of 0.1% derived? Are these all the productivity gains that MOT is expecting the PTOs to achieve and could that be too low an expectation?",1,371,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00371
2023-05-08-T-018,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, related to that, how closely does LTA work with the PTO to conceive and implement productivity enhancing measures and how can LTA be sure that the PTOs do not treat the 0.1% productivity contribution as a cost of doing business without significant productivity gains that will reduce costs over the long term and help to stave off future fare hikes?",2,372,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00372
2023-05-08-T-018,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And lastly, when PTOs rationalise bus services – for example, the removal of bus services 22, 66 and 506 for my residents in Bedok Reservoir in 2022 and 2021, sorry I am not letting go of this – which saves the Government $9.5 million a year in subsidies, how are these cost savings passed to commuters?",3,373,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00373
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his persistence and perseverance. Let me try and deal with the issues in turn.",1,374,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00374
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, the formula – I think it is important to understand that 0.1% is a productivity contribution, but it is a deduction from the fare increase. So, leaving aside, for example, the recent periods when it is 12% or 13% and so on, if you look at in general, let us say you have a year when the fare increases 2%. When I extract 0.1% from you, if the fare increase is 1%, I am extracting 10% from you; 2% is 5%. If it is a 3% increase, then 3.3% and so on. So, it is actually quite a sizeable imposition on the PTOs. It is not a free pass by any means.",2,375,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00375
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member's point about whether we are doing more to work with them on productivity and other areas, absolutely. I think this is an important thing. It is a win-win. It is not something where we want LTA to just dictate and be left with it. We see this as a joint endeavour and that is why many of the moves that are being made, in terms of technology, fuel efficiencies and so on, these are all areas that we are working together with the PTOs on.",3,376,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00376
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the Member's point on rationalising bus services and, when there are savings, how does it get passed through to commuters? So, if I may, like the Member, persevere and persist with my counterpoints, the fact is that we are subsidising bus services a billion dollars a year. We are not recovering costs by any stretch. So, any savings are ploughed back into the system and it just gets distributed at large. But the bottom line is that we are subsidising public transport significantly. A billion dollars for bus, a billion dollars for train, or, if you want to think about it in another way, every journey gets a $1 subsidy. That is not counting those who are on concession passes and those who are buying the concession fares; those who get concession fares and also the concession passes.",4,377,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00377
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, by all accounts – and I think being very objective – we are making a strong effort to ensure that our public transport system remains affordable. If you look at international comparisons, the answer is we are. And if you look at our own pattern over time, expenditure on public transport, as a percentage of household expenses, actually, over the last 10 years, it has been declining for the quintile, decile, almost all the key metrics that we look at.",5,378,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00378
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, my point is, we will continue to do our best to keep public transport affordable. There is a significant amount of subsidy. When we get savings, it is basically ploughed back into the system. We cannot do it at the particular service level; it has to be at the aggregated level. But in the end, what really has an impact on the final expenditure incurred by the commuter is the subsidy that the Government gives, and that is not insubstantial.",6,379,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00379
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Vikram Nair.,1,380,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00380
2023-05-08-T-018,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I thank the Minister for a very clear explanation on a difficult and emotive topic. I have a few clarifications on this five-year COE being brought forward. The first is  is this just one-off to deal with the current trough or is this going to be a change in approach to how the  five-year COEs,1,381,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00381
2023-05-08-T-018,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second clarification is that I believe the Minister said they would be re-allocated to Cat A. I just want to clarify, would they be re-allocated according to the expiring category or would they all be re-allocated only to Cat A?",2,382,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00382
2023-05-08-T-018,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The third clarification is I just wish to make the point that I think it is sensible to smoothen out the supply over the long term. Any measures to help do that would be fair.,3,383,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00383
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank the Member for agreeing with us that this effort to smoothen supply is something that is appropriate. It is a one-off exercise and, specifically, because it is a five-year COE, the time horizon is five years. LTA would not know how many  five-year COEs",1,384,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00384
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the only component that we can deal with, with certainty, is the	five-year COE and that certainty is only available on a five-year outlook basis, and that is why we are doing this as a one-off, because it also serves a very important purpose of smoothening the supply from now, especially because now we are more or less in the trough of the 10-year cycle. So, it is a good time to look at how we can do some smoothening and this is the reason we are adopting this. And, yes, the supply will go back to the relevant category.",2,385,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00385
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.,1,386,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00386
2023-05-08-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just two questions for the Minister for Transport and they are quite narrow, relating to the volatility or trying to manage the volatility in COE prices. So, the first question is  with regard to car loan restrictions, which are now at seven years and at 70% of the selling price, is the Ministry intending to look at the loopholes vis-a-vis these car loan curbs, because it is not uncommon to hear of dealerships offering 100% loans and things of that nature. That is the first question.",1,387,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00387
2023-05-08-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to the continuing relevance of the Cat E COE, the open category. Unlike Cat A and Cat B, which we know are tied to car registration numbers, the Cat E COE can be traded for up to three months, if I recall correctly. So, there is a potential speculative vector in Cat E COEs. I would like to know what is MOT's view on the continued relevance of Cat E COEs and whether removing that category altogether can help towards a smoother COE system.",2,388,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00388
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Leader of the Opposition. Just to be very clear, we are not talking about volatility in prices. That is not the objective of the exercise. It is volatility in supply. How prices eventuate in the market – as I have discussed and all of us know – is a function of various factors that are taking place. Today, the prices may go down, tomorrow they may go up. We think that the long-term trajectory is upwards for the reasons I have mentioned. Our supply is basically zero growth. So, it is capped. And the demand is a function, among other things, of incomes, and incomes are rising. So, we must be prepared for this.",1,389,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00389
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, if every time COE prices go up, we approach it as some kind of a new phenomenon, I think we should take pause and understand that these are the fundamentals that we are dealing with. It is a hard choice we have to make. And the decision to have a zero vehicle growth rate is a very hard choice.",2,390,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00390
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But what is the alternative? So, I just want to be very clear. It is not about price volatility, although that, I know, is a political concern. It is about supply volatility and how much we can smoothen that so that the market can function. That is the key thing.",3,391,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00391
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the point on curbs on car loans, this should be a question answered by MAS. Was there a PQ on this already? Today or? Maybe I will allow my colleague, Alvin Tan, to reply. But let me just say this. Loans are under the purview of MAS and, if it is hire purchase, then I think it is under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). But the key point I want to make is that the moves we are making from the MOT and LTA perspectives are really in order to ensure the market functions as we intended and to smoothen the supply and that is why we are going for this.",4,392,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00392
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the Member's second question on the relevance of Cat E, first, we need to size the thing correctly. Cat E has 10% only. Of Cat A and Cat B, 10% goes into Cat E, alright? So, why do we do that?",5,393,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00393
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Essentially, we have had basically a Cat E component from the very beginning, and why is that important? When you have got these very fixed categories, you need a mechanism, a valve, if you will, that can help redistribute some because preferences may change over time. There may be a greater shift towards Cat A, there may be a greater shift to bigger cars, there may be other kinds of movements. We do not know. So, this really creates a valve in the system. It is a valve that we have actually been progressively throttling down. In fact, in the early days, it was much more – the contribution from the different categories – and today it is 10%. So, it is at a level we, of course, as I have said, with COEs and the system, the Government has always been reviewing and constantly evaluating the relevance of measures. But I am just trying to give the context for the Leader of the Opposition's benefit.",6,394,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00394
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, it serves an important purpose. I do not think it is a purpose that is irrelevant in today's context by any means and for the foreseeable future. But if there are some other efforts to think about the design of the system, then, at that point, maybe this can be revisited. So, the reason why you cannot say I create a valve but then I restrict its usage. That is why you need the flexibility. If you cannot trade it and apply it to different categories and give them enough time to do that, then you may as well not have the category. So, the design and the features are tied specifically to the intent behind having the category. Alvin, would you like to say something?",7,395,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00395
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Minister of State Alvin Tan, if you would like to contribute to the debate.",1,396,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00396
2023-05-08-T-018,Alvin Tan,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan),"Sir, just to build on the Minister's point. There is a PQ by Ms Mariam Jafaar at No 64 on today's Order Paper. So, I will respond for MAS using that PQ. But, primarily, MAS' restrictions on loans that are granted by financial institutions are to encourage borrowers to spend or to borrow prudently.",1,397,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00397
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Members, the Minister gave a 25-minute Statement. I have allowed 20 minutes of clarifications. I know this is an important topic for both sides of the House. I propose to conclude this aspect of the business at the 60th minute mark. So, we have another 10 to 15 minutes. Mr Ang Wei Neng.",1,398,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00398
2023-05-08-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply. I have two supplementary questions on the Cat E COE. As what the Minister has said, the contribution of Cat E COE is from 10% of deregistered Cats A, B and C. I want to ask the Minister why do we want to contribute from Cat C where it is mainly used for commercial vehicles and all the Cat E COEs are mainly to register Cat B COE, which means that you are shrinking the Cat C COEs meant for commercial vehicles.",1,399,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00399
2023-05-08-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"For the second supplementary question, I am very thankful that the Minister is using the COEs expiring in the next five years to reach earlier in the next few quarters. The Minister has said that they will go back to the respective categories. So, I would like to urge the Minister to really distribute more to Cat A COEs because it is a mass market COE, whereas the Cat E COEs always mirror and always register for Cat B COEs.",2,400,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00400
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,May I ask Members to keep your clarifications short?,1,401,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00401
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I thank the Member for his suggestions.,1,402,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00402
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, why does Cat C also contribute to Cat E? Because Cat E can also be used for Cat C. That it is not the case today does not mean that it would not be the case tomorrow. That is why I am saying that what we have to bear in mind is that the market has its own dynamic. We do not know how things will go. People may decide that they do not like cars, they do not want cars and there may be a need more for commercial vehicles in which your Cat E will end up being used for Cat C.",2,403,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00403
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Or people may shift their preferences to smaller cars because they want to be more environmentally conscious or spend less and so on. And then, your Cat E could potentially go in there.",3,404,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00404
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And, in fact, we do see some of those sorts of behaviours. The point is, you must take from the categories to which the Cat E can apply and that is why we do this.",4,405,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00405
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For motorcycles, for example, we do not do that. This was some years back and the reason is because you do not allow Cat E to be used for motorcycles. So, that sort of takes the motorcycles out of it. But for all the other vehicles, they are in the same class and we put them in that contribution group.",5,406,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00406
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Can we do more? This is already a big move – taking five-year COEs that are expiring in the future and bringing them to the present. That is a one big move. It is a necessary move and we think it will have a salutary impact overall on the system. So, that is why we are doing it.",6,407,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00407
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But we just want to have a situation where we do not make too many arbitrary kind of decisions. So, in response to Mr Vikram Nair's question earlier, I said we will re-allocate on this basis, that Cat A will come back to Cat A, Cat B to Cat B. And based on the numbers and what we can see, it should meet the objective of smoothening supply. There is no need for cross-deployment.",7,408,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00408
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As I said earlier in my Ministerial Statement, for the bidding quarter we are having now, it will increase supply by 24%. I think that is quite substantial. In fact, the five-year COEs that are available for Cat B, we are a lot less and that is why also, consequently, you see a much lower percentage increase of about 15%.",8,409,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00409

2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have two questions for the Minister.",1,411,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00411
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One is the whole discussion here actually is about prices going up too fast, too high and also about equity. When prices go up high, many Singaporeans will not be able to afford. So, one of the grievances that I have also heard from some residents is that the Cat A and Cat B, a lot of the expensive cars are now going down to Cat A. So, as a result, in order to ensure more equity amongst Singaporeans – the lower-income can still buy cars, the cheaper cars – will the Minister consider putting OMV as an additional criterion for classifying Cat A? That is one question.",2,412,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00412
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is that, for the recent phenomenon we have seen in the motorcycle market, it has indicated that the Government does have some leverage on controlling the prices in the motorcycle COE market. With the recent collapse, I think it is a reflection that not enough has been done in the past. Going forward, will the Minister say that the Government will be more careful because the price of a motorcycle is very important for many of our working Singaporeans; so, to be more careful in maybe controlling the prices of the motorcycle COE?",3,413,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00413
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, can I just understand  so, does the Member think that lowering of the price is good or bad? I mean, I am trying to understand. When the Member said ""be more careful"", what does he mean?",1,414,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00414
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Minister, lowering is good. We will prefer to have a lower price.",1,415,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00415
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, if I may just ask one other question while the Member is at the lectern. Because I took considerable pains to explain this. Does the Member agree that if the supply is limited, in fact, capped at zero growth, and incomes are rising, that the almost unavoidable conclusion is that the prices must rise?",1,416,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00416
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Deputy Speaker, to answer the Minister, yes, we agree to many of the things that the Minister has said. For example, we have to control car population; as a result, we require the COE system to allocate the COEs, limited supply.",1,417,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00417
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"However, I think the Government should also be careful when prices go up too fast, there will be problems, problem from the aspect of affordability and also from the aspect of equity. So, as a result, the discussion today is actually about that, that prices have gone up too much. Like the motorcycle COE has gone up multiple times over the last two years. So, we prefer a lower price.",2,418,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00418
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We all prefer lower prices, Mr Leong. Let us be very clear about that. We all want to help the people who buy cars and motorbikes. I do not think you have a monopoly of virtue in that regard. The real question here is, and if I hear you correctly, you accept that the long-term trend in prices must be up. So, now, your point is more about the rate of change and whether that can be something that can be done.",1,419,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00419
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"If I can take the Member's second question first. We do not control prices. I want to put that categorically on the table because we are not stipulating the price or even a range. The only thing that the Government is able to do is settle on the supply and if there are any mechanics in the system, whether there are reasons to adjust them. That is what we have been doing. How that flows into the market or works through the market is also dependent on demand, as the Member would know and, finally, the price outcome is how the market settles it.",2,420,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00420
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We know that the Cat D price has come down. But does this mean that this is the new level? I think even if you listen to the industry players, they would advocate that we watch this for a while because whether it is buyers or dealers, they all have to sort of assess the situation and the market will have to find a new equilibrium. Where that is, I cannot say. But what I can say with certainty is that, in the long term, we will see upward price pressure for the fundamental realities we have discussed. So, we do not control prices. Please do not advocate that.",3,421,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00421
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, Mr Leong makes this political point about higher COE prices mean many Singaporeans cannot afford. So, the sub-text here is that somehow it is foreigners who are buying it – because if Singaporeans cannot afford it, who is buying it? So, that is the Member's implication. I want the Member to be upfront about it because I have taken pains to point out again that the proportion of foreigners buying cars has remained low and stable.",4,422,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00422
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, yes, what is happening is actually and the correct characterisation may well be that when the COE price goes up, some people will find it more difficult to afford; other people may find it easier to afford. So, there is a re-allocation and distribution going on within our society. And that is one of the things. It is a politically uncomfortable thing but it is a reality. And I would urge the Member to be careful in the way he makes this point; otherwise, we give wrong conclusions and we end up distorting the discussion.",5,423,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00423
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But having said that, if the Member wants to respond to this specifically, please do so.",6,424,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00424
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"I think you can carry on, Minister.",1,425,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00425
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Thank you. The other point that the Member makes is on OMV and whether OMV should be used as a basis for categories.,1,426,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00426
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I had addressed the Member's point in my Ministerial Statement. The median OMV for Cat B is about 70%, 75% more than the median OMV for Cat A. That means actually the market is already quite separated; I mean, you have the separation in terms of value. The next thing is we have achieved this or this is the outcome but the criteria, we are using our objective criteria – engine capacity, power output, what I have described earlier. And our objective has always been to make sure that these criteria are able to accommodate the mass market models in the Cat A, as far as possible. That was one of the reasons for the recent adjustment so that the mass market electric vehicle models could also be captured.",2,427,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00427
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But is there going to be some movement on the margin? Yes. So, you will see, as the Member has put it, some of the more expensive type cars migrating to the Cat A. But by the same token, we also have what are considered generally as mass market cars that are actually in Cat B. Examples will be some of the SUVs like Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi something or other. Because of their engine capacity, two litres, they are in Cat B.",3,428,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00428
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What I am trying to say is that it is not a clean cut. And the problem with using an OMV, amongst other things, is that the OMV is not something that is objective criteria because there are a lot of other variables. For example, if exchange rates move, the OMV of the car changes. So, how would you account for that?",4,429,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00429
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"When we are making these recommendations, let us keep this in mind that there are many moving parts. But the fundamental objective, which is the point that the Member is also driving at, we want to ensure that there is an element of progressivity in our COE system. And that is why we have two categories. And, as I said in my Ministerial Statement, we will continue to look at this and if there is a need to adjust the criteria that divide the two categories, we will look at it. But as of now, there is no compelling reason and, certainly, not to use the OMV.",5,430,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00430
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Mr Leong, insofar as you are going to respond to the Minister's question to you, you are allowed to do so. And then, we will end with the last hand which I see, which is Mr Pritam Singh. And then, we will move on. So, Mr Leong, would you like to respond to the Minister? No clarifications, please. Just your answer to the Minister.",1,431,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00431
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I would like to respond to the Minister's point about whether I am pinpointing foreigners crowding out the Singaporeans in the market. In this instance, about this COE, no. My question is about the equity amongst Singaporeans.",1,432,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00432
2023-05-08-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The Minister mentioned that COE prices for the OMV value between Cat A and Cat B, there is a 75% difference. But actually, that may not capture the whole picture. So, anyway, we are just urging the Government to further consider so that under Cat A, the slightly lower-income Singaporeans can still afford the cheaper cars.",2,433,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00433
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Minister, do you want to respond?",1,434,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00434
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Maybe after the last clarification.,1,435,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00435
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Very well, after Mr Pritam Singh. Mr Pritam Singh.",1,436,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00436
2023-05-08-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just a quick point in response to the remark made by Minister of State Mr Alvin Tan vis-a-vis Mariam Jaafar's question for today's Order Paper. It is directed at the Prime Minister and specifically to MAS on curbs on car loans. As we know and as the Minister has alluded to, we also have car loans which take the form of almost like money lending or quasi-money lending arrangements. You have hire purchase, which comes under MTI.",1,437,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00437
2023-05-08-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, just to confirm whether this would be a whole-of-Government exercise to look at car loans or vehicle loans, including even motorcycle loans, and whether there is any prospect of a review to ensure that the loopholes, with regard to the financing of vehicles, can be further looked at and even tightened, if need be.",2,438,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00438
2023-05-08-T-018,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the short answer is MAS will work with MOT to monitor the situation in the COE market.",1,439,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00439
2023-05-08-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Minister Iswaran, if you can close the business on this subject?",1,440,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00440
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Yes. I thank Mr Leong for clarifying that he is not making the argument that foreigners are depriving Singaporeans of cars, because he has been known to make that argument in other contexts. So, I wanted to be very sure about it. It is okay. You do not need to pursue the matter.",1,441,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00441
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But having said that, I just want to thank all Members for a very vigorous clarification session. The objective, if I may restate, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that we need to make sure that all of us in this House and Singaporeans in general understand the fundamental constraints that we are dealing with. We cannot run away from them and those constraints around land, around carbon emissions and what we need to do are something that we will have to grapple with.",2,442,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00442
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Previous Transport Ministers have had to do this, I am doing it, future Transport Ministers will have to do this. But, in the end, they need this House to support and also the broader society because if we do not internalise these constraints, then we are always going to be unhappy with the outcome.",3,443,2023-05-08-T-018-S-00443
2023-05-08-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What we do need to do though is then work on all the other options and solutions so that we can make the transport system in Singapore not just car-lite but, as I have said, accessible and inclusive and sustainable.

2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a joint Bill by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).",2,453,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00453
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Conceptually, it proposes changes in two areas  one, on the enforcement of maintenance orders; and two, on Court proceedings and procedure in the Family Justice Courts (FJC).",3,454,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00454
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I will speak on the first area and my colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu, will cover the second. Minister of State Sun Xueling will then touch on support for families undergoing divorce from the MSF perspective.",4,455,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00455
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Sir, to better understand the changes proposed in this Bill, I think it is useful, first, to consider the approach to family justice that we take here.",5,456,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00456
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Family disputes are not like other kinds of disputes. They often involve a lot of emotions, psychological wounds and vulnerable parties, particularly children. You contrast that with the usual litigation process which generally pits the parties as adversaries and looks to the past to determine who was right and wrong. If you apply that kind of approach to family disputes, I think the tendency will often be to deepen the rift between the parties and it could overlook the well-being of the children who are caught in the middle.",6,457,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00457
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"So, in Singapore, for some time now, we have taken a modified approach to family disputes, focusing on Therapeutic Justice. The approach tries to get the parties to reach a common ground and move on with their lives. The changes we have made over the years reflect this approach.",7,458,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00458
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"With your permission, Sir, may I ask that the Clerks of Parliament distribute a handout on some of these changes?",8,459,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00459
2023-05-08-T-021,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Please do. [,1,460,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00460
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Members may also access the handout through the SG Parl MP mobile app.,1,461,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00461
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me now turn to the Bill, specifically as it relates to the enforcement of maintenance orders. I will explain, one, the need for change; two, the key changes that we are proposing; and three, what we hope to achieve.",2,462,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00462
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Over the years, we have progressively refined the maintenance enforcement framework. This includes introducing new sanctions against maintenance defaulters, such as mandatory financial counselling, community service orders and credit bureau reporting. Nevertheless, we still see a fairly high number of cases of non-compliance with maintenance orders.",3,463,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00463
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Before COVID-19, from 2017 to 2019, there was an annual average of 2,700 applications to enforce maintenance orders. And 15% to 20% of these were repeat applications made within the same year. Some applicants made three to four applications to enforce the same maintenance order within a year.",4,464,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00464
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When you see these numbers, you can understand that behind these numbers, there are also anxiety, frustration, other real-life consequences. Especially for the applicants – they are usually women, struggling with supporting the children, their jobs, while not getting any maintenance. Members have given voice to these concerns before. They include Ms Jessica Tan, Dr Tan Wu Meng and others who spoke about this. Single parents struggling with job stress, caregiving, other responsibilities and they need to take time off work to attend enforcement hearings. Some bring their children to the Court hearings because they do not have alternate care arrangements.",5,465,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00465
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At this point, I think it is useful for me to share the facts relating to two cases, as illustrations.",6,466,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00466
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The first, I will refer to one of the parties as Mdm A. Following her divorce, she had care and control of the parties’ two young children; her ex-husband was ordered to pay child maintenance at $1,500 a month. Two years after the divorce, Mdm A had not received any maintenance payments, though she had taken out enforcement proceedings. She was left to support her two children and elderly parents alone.",7,467,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00467
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is how she described her frustrations in an email that she sent to me, and I quote  “Monies have to be spent each [time] an individual seeks legal advice; monies that most ex-spouses can ill-afford. Perhaps this is why most give up the fight, because they can no longer afford to pay for another Court hearing and receive another ruling that will not be enforced.”",8,468,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00468
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second case, I will call the lady Mdm B. Like Mdm A, Mdm B also had care and control of the parties’ two young children, and her ex-husband was ordered to maintain her and the children at $1,500 per month. But for five years, from 2017 to 2022, Mdm B did not receive any payments from her ex-husband, save for a one-time payment of $50, even after she had filed multiple enforcement applications. For his breaches, the ex-husband was sentenced to prison, one to two days each time, but he still did not pay, despite having the means to pay. By 2022, the child maintenance arrears, accumulated over 61 months, was a total of $91,000. So, how did Mdm B cope? She coped single-handedly to support her children through primary school and borrowed from friends and neighbours.",9,469,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00469
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,What I have just described for Mdm A and Mdm B is the unfortunate reality for some. It arises because some husbands just refuse to pay and I am referring to those who can pay but would not pay. It is quite separate if they just cannot pay. I will come back to this later.,10,470,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00470
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In the White Paper on Women’s Development, which was issued in 2021, the Government recognised maintenance enforcement as a key challenge for women in vulnerable situations, and the Government committed to simplify and strengthen the enforcement process and minimise the need for repeat applications for enforcement.",11,471,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00471
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you look at the issues, first, there are limited means of obtaining information on the parties’ assets and means. This makes it difficult to distinguish between respondents who cannot pay maintenance and those who simply refuse to pay because the information is not fully in. And this then often leads to a second problem, which is repeat non-compliance.",12,472,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00472
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For respondents who refuse to pay, the Court may find it difficult to make more targeted enforcement orders because it does not have the full information on their assets and means. When the Court processes provide for applications and getting this information, actually getting it into Court can be a challenge at times.",13,473,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00473
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And for respondents who cannot pay, they just do not have the money and the Courts keep making the orders, they will simply continue to miss maintenance payments, without some other form of intervention. Again, it does not help anyone.",14,474,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00474
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, the process can be time-consuming, resource-intensive and difficult to navigate, especially for self-represented parties.",15,475,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00475
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, under this Bill, what are we trying to do? We are creating a new Maintenance Enforcement Process – I will call it MEP – to address these issues.",16,476,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00476
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The MEP will seek to strengthen deterrence against respondents who refuse to pay; and it will try and facilitate more sustainable outcomes for respondents who genuinely cannot pay and it will try and increase access to justice for applicants, especially those who are self-represented.",17,477,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00477
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A key part of the proposals is the establishment of a new unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs). MEOs will be appointed by the Law Minister and their functions will include the following  one, they can conduct fact-finding on the parties’ financial circumstances; two, they can refer suitable and needy parties to financial assistance and other forms of support; three, they can conduct conciliation sessions and facilitate settlements between the parties; four, they can submit the information gathered from the fact-finding and conciliation sessions to the Court.",18,478,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00478
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With your permission, again, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute an infographic, which will set out the workflow of the new MEP?",19,479,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00479

2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"An application to enforce a maintenance order can be made online. At this stage, the applicant can also directly apply online for financial assistance, allowing such help to be given as early in the process as possible. After this, the parties must submit documents on their financial circumstances to the MEO. That could include payslips, bank statements.",3,483,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00483
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If the information is insufficient, the MEO may seek information from the parties, banks, third parties, some of whom will be prescribed and these would include Central Provident Fund (CPF), Housing and Development Board (HDB), Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), Singapore Land Authority (SLA), Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP).",4,484,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00484
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is a major step and a game changer. This power will be subject to safeguards, including restrictions on the use of information obtained by MEOs and, in some cases, requiring MEOs to obtain a Court order when seeking information from third parties.",5,485,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00485
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With the MEO’s fact-finding powers, the MEOs and the Court will be better able to distinguish between respondents who cannot pay and those who refuse to pay. For the former, the MEOs will be able to refer them to Social Service Offices for financial assistance and other support.",6,486,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00486
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"After the fact-finding is completed, the parties will have to attend conciliation sessions with the MEO, who can recommend solutions and facilitate settlement. The MEO will report to the Court on the parties' financial circumstances and the conciliation sessions.",7,487,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00487
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This will relieve the party asking for maintenance – the wife – from having to take on the burden of getting the facts, spending a lot of money on legal fees and, hopefully, it will also reduce the amount of effort a wife has to put in to get maintenance.",8,488,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00488
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Court will take into account the MEO's report when deciding on the application. The Court can vary any maintenance order, taking into account the financial position of the parties.",9,489,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00489
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Where the parties have not settled and the Court orders the respondent to pay maintenance, the Court must make what is known as a Show-Payment Order (SPO). The SPO will usually be for a period of six months and it will require the respondent to show to the Court, at specified future intervals, that he or she has made the requisite payments.",10,490,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00490
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When making the SPO, the Court must generally also specify a term of imprisonment that the respondent may be liable for if the respondent breaches the SPO. This continued monitoring, coupled with strong deterrence, should reduce repeated defaults in at least a fair number of cases.",11,491,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00491
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With the information provided by the MEO, the Court will also be better able to make more targeted and effective enforcement orders to recover arrears – for example, an order for attachment of a debt – and can do so without the applicant having to apply separately, or specifically, for such orders.",12,492,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00492
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At the post-hearing stage, the MEP caters for several possible scenarios of default. I will not cover these scenarios and the consequences of default specifically. The details are in the infographic that has been handed out and, of course, in the Bill.",13,493,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00493
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But Members will see that, in general, the consequences for failing to show proof of payment, in accordance with the SPO, are immediate and serious. If a respondent defaults on the SPO with no good cause shown, he may be sentenced to imprisonment.",14,494,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00494
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The MEP also provides a more streamlined process for enforcing maintenance payments, where a respondent defaults on such payments shortly after an SPO expires.",15,495,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00495
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There is one further area of change to the maintenance enforcement process, which is not shown in the infographic. Under the existing law, an applicant who suspects that a respondent intends to dissipate, or has dissipated assets to frustrate the maintenance claim, can apply for an injunction or a clawback order. However, the applicant will likely face evidential difficulties in proving the respondent's intent to dissipate property specifically to frustrate a maintenance order.",16,496,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00496
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To address this, we will create a rebuttable presumption of the respondent's intent to dissipate. Under the proposed changes, this presumption will be raised if the applicant can show an impending or relevant dissipation, depending on whether an injunction or clawback order is sought and that the impending or relevant dissipation, as the case may be, will or did frustrate the enforcement of the maintenance order.",17,497,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00497
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With these changes, the burden is on the respondent to prove that he did not intend to frustrate the maintenance claim. This will, hopefully, deter parties from circumventing maintenance orders through the wilful dissipation of assets.",18,498,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00498
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What do we hope to achieve with these changes? Primarily, three things  one, stronger deterrence against non-compliance with maintenance orders; two, more sustainable maintenance outcomes for families with genuine financial difficulties; and three, easier process for enforcement of maintenance orders when they are not complied with.",19,499,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00499
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Overall, these changes will improve access to justice, especially for self-represented parties, who, as I said earlier, are involved in the vast majority of maintenance enforcement cases.",20,500,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00500
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As Members can empathise, it is difficult to expect parties to move on when maintenance obligations are breached, especially if the breaches occur repeatedly. Such breaches can also spur retaliatory action by the other side and pull both parties further apart.",21,501,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00501
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, an applicant with care and control of the children may be tempted to withhold access to them, if the respondent does not make timely maintenance payments. These disputes that linger and spiral long after the divorce proceedings can worsen the anguish for the parties and their children and also take a toll on those around them.",22,502,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00502
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With the MEP, we hope to change a bit of this and make the post-divorce journey slightly easier.",23,503,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00503
2023-05-08-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I conclude, Sir, I would like to thank the FJC judges, Court staff, the Family Bar, academics, our social service partner agencies and other stakeholders for working with us on these reforms. We hope to continue to work with all of these partners to shape our family justice system to achieve more positive outcomes in protecting, restoring and healing families.",24,504,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00504

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),Minister Shanmugam has touched upon one key area of reform in the Bill – the new Maintenance Enforcement Process. I will now turn to the other key area of reform this Bill seeks to effect – the enhancement of Court proceedings and procedure in the Family Justice Courts (FJC).,3,509,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00509
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The changes we are making in this area support the ideals outlined earlier in Minister Shanmugam's speech. The amendments will  strengthen protection for children and other vulnerable parties, including victims of family violence; make family proceedings simpler and more efficient, thereby enhancing access to justice for all Court users of the FJC; strengthen Therapeutic Justice elements in FJC proceedings, by giving the Courts the power to manage proceedings in a manner which reduces acrimony and ensures a fair outcome without undue delay, complexity and cost.",4,510,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00510

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),The Government then consulted the public and stakeholders on the RERF Committee's recommendations and has since then been working to implement the recommendations.,7,513,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00513
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"For example, MSF announced in 2022 that the Mandatory Co-Parenting Programme will be extended from only parents who disagree on divorce and ancillary matters, to all parents with minor children on the Simplified Track. This will help more parents to focus on making informed decisions that prioritise the well-being of their children in the divorce process.",8,514,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00514

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"In its report, the RERF Committee observed that the filing of unnecessary applications in family proceedings prolongs proceedings, promotes acrimony and strains judicial resources. This is a particularly pertinent issue in family proceedings, which are emotionally charged. Such strong emotions can hinder rational thinking and cloud judgement.",13,519,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00519
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),There are cases where parties who are caught up in the heat of the litigation resort to taking out unnecessary and unmeritorious applications in Court to vex the other party or to paint the other party in a bad light. Such applications may also be made repeatedly.,14,520,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00520
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"For example, one party may make repeated applications against the other party for discovery of documents which have little relevance or evidential value to the issue at hand.

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The new section 11A of the Family Justice Act will implement the Committee's recommendation. There are two parts to the new section 11A. The first part of section 11A deals with certain applications by a party in relation to an order already made in previous proceedings, for example, an application to vary, suspend or set aside a previous order. For ease of explaining the first part of section 11A, I shall call an application which falls into this category a ""variation application"".",18,524,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00524

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),Section 11A will promote a more efficient resolution of family proceedings and also reduce the acrimony and stresses which may be inflicted on the parties' relationship through the filing of unnecessary applications and documents.,22,528,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00528
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"I would like to share the story of Ms C, who has written to us on her family's experiences. Ms C's father and mother are divorced. Ms C has a younger sibling.",23,529,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00529
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"As the mother exhibited physical and emotionally abusive behaviour, the Court granted protection orders against the mother after the divorce, in favour of the father and the two children. After the protection orders were granted, over a period of three years, the mother filed close to 15 applications in Court against Ms C, her father and her sibling. This includes more than five applications to revoke the protection orders granted in favour of Ms C, her father and her sibling. In the case of the protection order obtained by Ms C, the mother's applications to revoke the protection order were dismissed.",24,530,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00530
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Ms C conveyed that each of the applications filed has taken a huge emotional toll on her family.

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Applying the new section 11A to Ms C's situation, the Court will be empowered to make an order prohibiting the mother from filing any further applications to revoke the protection orders in favour of Ms C, her father and her sibling without the Court's permission, if the Court is satisfied that the filing of any application to revoke the protection orders will be without merit, having regard to the mother's conduct in past proceedings, including the mother's series of unmeritorious applications to revoke the protection orders in the past.",26,532,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00532

Instead, families will be given the space to heal and move on, without having to return to Court repeatedly.",27,533,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00533
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),The new powers in section 11A will also help to enhance the efficiency of family proceedings by giving FJC the powers to weed out unmeritorious applications which unnecessarily protract proceedings.,28,534,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00534
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),Minister Shanmugam had earlier explained that the judge-led approach was introduced in 2014 to allow FJC to proactively manage the manner in which cases are run in family proceedings. The RERF Committee had recommended that there be greater clarity and guidance to family judges on how the judge-led approach is to be applied.,29,535,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00535
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"This Bill will, therefore, clarify and strengthen the judge-led approach through three key provisions. First, providing that judges may make orders of a substantive nature on their own motion. Second, empowering judges to impose restrictions on cross-examination in circumstances prescribed in subsidiary legislation. Third, providing that the Family Justice Rules (FJR) may set out the modes by which a child's wishes may be determined by the Court and this may include judicial interviews. I will explain each provision in turn.",30,536,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00536
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"For the first key provision, the RERF Committee recommended that the Court be expressly empowered to make substantive orders on its own motion. The new section 11B of the Family Justice Act will implement the Committee's recommendation.",31,537,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00537
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Family proceedings often involve litigants-in-person or self-represented parties.

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"In such situations, the new section 11B allows the Court to make the necessary orders to deal with the issues effectively, even if neither party has asked for the order specifically.",33,539,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00539
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"For instance, the Court may, in the course of conducting a case conference, make interim access orders to ensure that the child continues to have contact time with a parent until the matter can be resolved through mediation or determined in a formal hearing. The Court may do so even if none of the parties makes an application for an interim access order.",34,540,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00540
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),The rules of natural justice will be preserved. The Court's power to make an order of a substantive nature under section 11B may only be exercised if  every person likely to be affected by the order is first given an opportunity to be heard concerning the order; and the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to make the order.,35,541,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00541
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The second key provision is the new section 11C of the Family Justice Act, which will empower FJC to, on its own motion, or upon the application of any party, make the following orders  an order that cross-examination of a witness be restricted in scope or duration and an order that cross-examination be conducted in any manner prescribed by the FJR.",36,542,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00542
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"At present, rule 101A of the FJR already allows the Court to limit the scope and duration of cross-examination, or to disallow direct cross-examination in two situations  (a) a family violence trial in proceedings under Part 7 of the Women's Charter; (b) an application under section 67(1) of the Women's Charter to vary, suspend or revoke a protection order or an expedited order.",37,543,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00543
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The direct cross-examination of a victim of family violence by their alleged perpetrator can expose the victim to significant re-traumatisation. Subjecting the victims to the usual cross-examination may also affect their ability to give clear and cogent evidence in support of their case. After what has happened between them, victims may also find it challenging to effectively cross-examine their alleged perpetrator.",38,544,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00544
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"That being said, cross-examination is fundamental in testing and challenging the evidence of a witness and to accurately determine the facts on which the Court decides the matter. A balance, therefore, has to be struck.",39,545,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00545
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The RERF Committee considered the approaches in England and Australia on prohibiting cross-examination in family violence cases and recommended that the Courts should be empowered to restrict cross-examination in specified circumstances. The new section 11C, therefore, provides that the Court may only make the orders restricting cross-examination in circumstances to be prescribed in the FJR, for example, in circumstances where the questioning of a vulnerable witness is or is likely to be unduly intimidating and oppressive.",40,546,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00546

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The third key provision in the Bill provides that the FJR may set out the modes by which the wishes of a child may be determined by the Court. The intention is for the prescribed modes to expressly include interviews conducted by a judge with a child, in addition to the variety of other methods which may be used to hear a child's voice, such as through the Child Representatives or an assessment by a mental health professional.",42,548,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00548

Section 125 also specifically requires the Court to have regard to  (a) the wishes of the parents; and (b) the wishes of a child where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.",43,549,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00549
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"However, section 125 does not provide for the modes by which the child's wishes may be determined. The RERF Committee, in its report, discussed the benefits of judges conducting interviews with children and noted that, in Singapore, there have been cases where judges have conducted interviews with children to reach outcomes that serve the interests of the child.",44,550,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00550
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"An example of such a case is AZB v AZC [2016] SGHCF 1. In that case, the High Court Judge interviewed three children between the ages of 11 and 13 in a dispute between their parents on care and control and access arrangements. The Judge noted that there were indications that the children wished to speak with her. The children were mature enough to express their views on matters that impacted their lives. In deciding that it would be in the children's welfare to increase the access time with their mother, the Judge relied on, among other things, the Judge's conversations with the children which corroborated the finding that the children enjoyed access time with their mother.",45,551,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00551
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The Committee mentioned that there has been research highlighting children's wishes to be more involved in the decisions that may affect their lives profoundly and their dissatisfaction with the indirect processes that are available to them. The Committee recommended, therefore, that it should be made clear that the judge-led approach allows for a judge to interview a child.",46,552,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00552
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"It should be noted that each case is unique, with different considerations applying to each family and each child. It is not in every case that a judicial interview of children is suitable. In some cases, the Court may assess that it would be more appropriate to appoint a Child Representative, who is a trained professional appointed by the Court to represent the voice of a child and present an objective assessment of care arrangements which are in the child's best interest, or other professional, to hear from the child.",47,553,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00553
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Moving on to the next bucket of reforms, the Bill will amend various pieces of legislation to modernise and simplify nomenclature for family proceedings. For example, ""Plaintiff"" will be replaced by ""Applicant"", ""Defendant"" will be replaced by ""Respondent"" and ""Writ for divorce"" will be replaced by ""originating application for divorce"".",48,554,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00554

In the new Family Justice Rules to be introduced, the simplified terminology will also be adopted. These changes will make it easier for Court users and members of the public to understand family proceedings. This will amplify the existing efforts by the Government and Judiciary to enhance access to justice, especially for persons who cannot afford legal representation, by simplifying Court processes.",49,555,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00555

2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"I will elaborate on two of these amendments. First, on mediation and other alternative dispute resolution processes or ""ADR processes"" for short. Currently, the Family Justice Act provides that a Family Court or Youth Court, respectively, may, on its own motion or upon the application of any party, order any party or any child who is the subject of proceedings, to undergo mediation or counselling, or to participate in any family support programme or activity.",51,557,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00557
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The Court also has powers to order a party or child to undergo other ADR processes, or to attend professional clinical or therapeutic intervention sessions. The Bill will clarify in the Family Justice Act that a Family Court or Youth Court has such powers. The Bill will also clarify in legislation the existing powers of the Court to appoint Judicial officers, officers of the FJC or any other persons, such as volunteer lawyers, to conduct mediations or other ADR processes. Amendments will also be made to provide that a Family Court or Youth Court may make the appropriate and necessary orders where a person fails to comply with the Court's orders to attend mediation or other ADR process, such as an order staying proceedings until the orders are complied with.",52,558,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00558
2023-05-08-T-021,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Second, the Bill will adopt section 43 of the State Courts Act which applies to a District Court, by expressly providing that the Family Court may order that a judgment sum be paid in a lump sum or by instalments, and may order that a judgment be suspended or stayed if the judgment debtor is unable to pay the sum. The amendments will align the position under the Family Justice Act with that in section 43 of the State Courts Act. Depending on the circumstances of the case, in certain situations, instead of incurring time and costs in enforcement or bankruptcy proceedings, it may be more sensible and in the interests of both parties, for the Court to grant a short reprieve to the judgment debtor, or to allow the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor by way of instalments. This is especially important in family proceedings where further litigation would put an additional strain on the fractured relationship and adversely impact children involved in the proceedings.",53,559,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00559

2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I agree with the rationale outlined by the REFF Committee. Apart from strengthening the Therapeutic Justice element in the family proceedings, reposing such a power with the Court, in my respectful view, may also serve to guard against situations where the husband and wife together agree to post-divorce arrangements that may not be suitable for the children of the marriage, particularly young children who are of school-going age.",6,595,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00595
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Such situations, unfortunately, occur from time to time despite the common wisdom that they should be prioritising the needs of their children.

2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The hon Minister highlighted in his speech that family disputes are unique because, amongst others, they involve vulnerable children. The interests of vulnerable children may not necessarily be aligned with those of their parents.

2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In these cases, as there was agreement between the parties, the Court proceeded to endorse the parties' agreement on the assumption that the parents have catered for the needs of their young children. It is only after disposing the matrimonial property that the issue of the children's interest not being sufficiently safeguarded came to the fore. In such cases, the parent who has custody of the children may then make an appeal to HDB for urgent accommodation, presenting HDB with a fait accompli. As we all know, such requests are not easily acceded to. In the end, the children suffer from the decisions of their parents.",9,598,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00598

2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It seems to me that part of the problem lies with the fact that there exists an information asymmetry between the parties to the divorce proceedings, HDB and the Court. HDB would be in the dark about what the parties represented to the Court about housing arrangements post-divorce. The Court may not know whether the parties' proposed housing arrangement is feasible as HDB's criteria are not cast in stone and it does exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis.",11,600,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00600
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"By providing the Court with the power to act on its own motion on substantive matters, it will be in a better position to make a just and equitable decision on the division of matrimonial property that affects the housing arrangements of the parties and their children post-divorce. We will, therefore, be better able to minimise the number of hardship cases involving parties and their children who run the risk of not having any place to stay or stay in less than conducive environments after they have sold their HDB flats pursuant to a Court order.",12,601,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00601

2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Currently, under Rule 114B of the Family Justice Rules 2014, the Court has the power to appoint a public officer as a Maintenance Record Officer, the MRO, who is considered as an officer of the Family Justice Court. The MRO has quasi-judicial powers similar to what is being proposed for the MEO. This includes the power to interview parties to the proceedings; and obtain documents and information on the financial circumstances of a party to proceedings from the party directly or from any other person, with the consent of the party. In addition, the MRO may be required to prepare for the Court a written report setting out his opinion on the financial circumstances of the party and whether he is able to pay maintenance. This report may be relied on by the Court as evidence of the matters stated in the report. This also mirrors what the MEO is supposed to do under the proposed maintenance regime.",22,611,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00611

I am merely pointing out that, as there is an important shift of responsibility from the Judiciary to the Executive that is being proposed, it is incumbent for the Executive arm of the Government to explain the reason for assuming this responsibility clearly.",27,616,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00616
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I now turn to the ambit of the power to be reposed on MEO with respect to information gathering.,28,617,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00617
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The hon Minister mentioned in his speech about the problem posed by respondents dissipating their assets to third parties and that would frustrate the applicant's endeavour to get paid under maintenance orders. This is one big area of concern and I am glad to note that there is a proposal to reverse the evidential burden so as to alleviate the problems on the part of the applying spouses.,29,618,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00618
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Another area where there could be a significant challenge is where the respondent has assets and properties which are held in the names of proxies. To make headway on such matters, there will be a need to conduct investigations, too. These investigations will include the relationship between the respondent and an identified proxy; the personal and financial background of the proxy; and any financial transactions between the respondent and the proxy. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the MEO has sufficient powers to do all these so as to be able to lift the veil of secrecy between the respondent and his proxy, depending on the case.",30,619,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00619
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Currently, I note that an MEO may avail himself of information from banks and prescribed third parties which I understand refers to specific Government agencies. These bodies may provide information as permitted under regulations which will be enacted sometime in the future. May I ask whether the scope of information that is contemplated to be provided to the MEO is wide enough to deal with inquiries on persons believed to be proxies of the respondents?",31,620,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00620
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I also note that, apart from the “bank” and a “prescribed third party”, the MEO may request the Court for an order that a “third party” provide him with relevant information. May I ask what is the ambit of this “third party”? Does it refer to any other Government agency that is not prescribed? Or does it only refer to any private person, and this may include legal entities, who may have relevant information? May I also confirm that a “third party” may include a person who is believed to be a proxy or has information that may be relevant for investigation into any proxy relationship?",32,621,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00621
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In summary, my first point on the leadership of judges in this process, as well as a whole-of-Government lens in information sharing, speaks to an important point on efficient implementation of justice. My second requires us to clarify a small but not unimportant matter. This clarity will help answer questions about the independence of such officers and to what extent their work requires an arms’ length from the Executive arm.",33,622,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00622
2023-05-08-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Sir, we strive to preserve families. This is a point that hon Minister of State Sun Xueling made at the outset of her speech when she said that MSF's aim is to nurture families. But we do not always succeed. It is important that the legislative process works to protect the interests of all parties when marriages dissolve. The ties that bind us, husband to wife, are ties that can be severed by divorce proceedings. But the tie that binds a citizen to his fellow men, and to his country, remains. Our laws must provide for this less intimate, but paradoxically, in this context, more enduring connection, in the pursuit of family justice.",34,623,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00623

2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Family Justice Reform Bill proposes to establish a new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which kicks in when applicants apply to enforce a maintenance order in the event of non-payment by their former spouse. The new MEP will apply to maintenance orders under the Women's Charter, Guardianship of Infants Act, Administration of Muslim Law Act, Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act and the Maintenance of Parents Act. I support the intent of this Bill to improve the enforcement process for maintenance payments. I would like to bring up a few brief points regarding the new process.",1,625,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00625
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, over the years, many divorced spouses have faced various difficulties in getting their former spouses to make their maintenance payments on time or even at all. Many spouses actually even gave up trying to get their payments.",2,626,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00626
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Under the current system, a common and frustrating experience for many is that former spouses delay or refuse to pay their maintenance for their ex-partners or children and do not pay up until their former partners take up an application in Court to enforce maintenance payments. Frequently, for those who can afford to pay, the payment can even be at the doorstep of the Court room, just before the hearing. On such an occasion, I understand that the applicant does not even get its legal costs paid despite having to take out such application and engaging a lawyer in the process.",3,627,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00627
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"And for many who default on their maintenance payments, their former spouses often had to take multiple applications. Many applicants had to take leave from work each time and would even lose income from spending time instructing their lawyers and attending Court hearings. Many, I am told, just gave up after a few tries. They just could not afford the time and efforts. Many prefer to spend the time earning more income to make up for their former spouses’ maintenance payments instead of expending time and efforts in applying repeatedly for enforcement.",4,628,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00628
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister, under the new MEP, how will the new process ensure that such phenomena will not happen or will be minimised. I note that under the new process, if a maintenance order has not been complied with, the applicant will have to make an application, albeit online, and if the Court were to make a Show-Payment Order requiring proof of payment, specifying an imprisonment term for the respondent’s breach of the Show-Payment Order, does that mean that the respondent can pay up after such an application is made for a Show-Payment Order or when he receives such an order?",5,629,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00629
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the new requirement of the MEOs having to distinguish between respondents who cannot afford to pay for maintenance due to their financial situation and those who refuse to pay when they can afford to do so. This is important; it will help to deter and weed out those who game the system by refusing to pay until at least an application for enforcement is made.",6,630,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00630
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Next, I note that under clause 89, once a maintenance enforcement application has been made, the MEOs have to prepare and submit a report to the Court. While the said clause allows the MEO to provide an interim report to any party whom the MEO thinks any information in the MEO’s report ought to be brought to the attention of such a party, the Bill does not seem to require the MEO to provide the full report to the applicant, the respondent or both.",7,631,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00631
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"This is somewhat unusual in our civil legal processes as documents or evidence to be considered in any proceedings are traditionally required to be disclosed to all parties in the same proceedings. Moreover, it would also be fair to both parties. For example, the applicant should know why the application fails and both parties should know its contents to decide whether it is fair and should be appealed against. If the respondent can afford his maintenance payments, disclosure of such report to the applicant may also deter the respondent from trying to hide his financial status.",8,632,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00632
2023-05-08-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I also note that clause 90 allows for redaction. I would like to ask the Minister what is the rationale, if any, for not allowing automatic and full disclosure of the MEO’s report to both parties in an application. I would also like to ask what type of information will likely be redacted from this report or excluded from the interim report if the judge decides that such report should be given to either party.",9,633,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00633

The Family Courts can consider, in addition to specifying clinical and therapeutic intervention sessions, also job and upskilling workshops to ensure that women have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives.

However, as an individual is only allowed to be listed in one HDB flat application, the HDB requires divorced parents to come to an agreement before either party lists their child in a flat application. Considering that we are looking at divorcees here, coming to an agreement is often easier said than done.",21,670,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00670
2023-05-08-T-021,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While one party can form a family nucleus with his or her children, the other party will not be able to. For a young divorcee under the age of 35, for example, he or she will not be able to apply for a flat by themselves under the Singles Scheme and not be able to form a family nucleus with his or her children. This could be especially problematic for some parents facing financial hardship or/and without family support, as it will not be practically possible for this parent to care for his or her child, without a stable place to call home.",22,671,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00671

2023-05-08-T-021,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),We may know of similar scenarios where a single mother had to wait for more than a year to receive maintenance from a former spouse.

2023-05-08-T-021,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"This bold step will ensure that vulnerable parties, such as children and former spouses, receive the financial support they need in a timely manner. Moreover, the Bill introduces the groundbreaking concept of family hearing, a major stride towards a more streamlined and effective Family Justice system. Family hearings will provide a platform for parties to discuss their disputes in a less adversarial setting and promote amicable resolutions. While the proposed Bill has many advantages, I seek clarification from the Ministry on certain aspects of the Bill.",5,680,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00680
2023-05-08-T-021,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"First, the Bill's provisions for stronger enforcement of maintenance orders are commendable. However, I am concerned about the impact of the new maintenance enforcement process on low-income families. Under the new process, parents who fail to pay maintenance will be subjected to more stringent enforcement measures, including imprisonment. And I am concerned that these measures may be too harsh for the low-income families who are genuinely unable to pay maintenance.",6,681,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00681

2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"How could gender-neutral maintenance payments be operationalised? This should be done by giving the Courts the discretion to order that, in appropriate cases, wives should pay maintenance to ex-husbands even if they are not incapacitated. Such cases could include where the husband earns much less than his ex-wife, or is a stay-home-husband, and has borne the bulk of domestic chores and caregiving.",3,689,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00689
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This is in contrast to the current maintenance regime in the Women’s Charter, which provides that, in a divorce, the Court may order a man to pay maintenance to his ex-wife but may order a woman to pay maintenance to her ex-husband only if he is incapacitated.",4,690,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00690

2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to elaborate, I call for the Government to consider providing for gender-neutral maintenance for the following reasons.",7,693,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00693
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"First, the number of stay-home husbands has been gradually increasing over the years. The Singapore Census Population 2020 showed that the percentage of married households where wives are the sole breadwinners – and I stress, married households – increased from 5.8% in 2010 to 7.4% in 2020. That is not an insignificant number at all. In fact, the Labour Force survey for Singapore in 2022 showed that 10.6% of caregivers outside the labour force are males, whether married or unmarried. Again, this is a not an insignificant minority.",8,694,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00694
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Many stay-at-home husbands, just like stay-at-home wives, have sacrificed their careers and incurred significant opportunity costs to spend years looking after their households and doing unpaid care work, such as raising the children. As a result, stay-at-home husbands may have far less savings as compared to their working wives and may well be financially vulnerable in the event of a divorce. Allowing the Courts to have discretion to award maintenance to such husbands would serve to recognise their care work and unpaid contributions. It would also help to safeguard the financially vulnerable spouse, whether husband or wife, which is, surely, the fundamental purpose of maintenance payments.",9,695,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00695
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, since the Women’s Charter was first enacted in 1961, women in Singapore have made significant progress. In 2020, 52.5% of married households were dual-income households, an increase from 47.1% in 2010. In 2022, the employment rate of females aged 15 and over was 60.9%, the fourth highest in comparison with OECD developed countries. With a larger proportion of women in the workforce, it could well be the case that women might out-earn men in some dual-income households and, thus, would make economic sense for the husband to take on the bulk of domestic work in a household, depending on the decisions that the husband and wife make in each particular case.",10,696,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00696
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, the current maintenance regime arguably reinforces traditional gendered household roles where men traditionally are regarded as “breadwinners” and women as “homemakers”, by providing that only incapacitated husbands qualify for maintenance. An Institute of Policy Studies survey of stay-at-home fathers in 2020 showed that many of the respondents, many of these stay-at-home dads, experienced “acute stigma” and family members often directed comments suggesting that they were “mooching” from their wives.",11,697,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00697
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, amending the law to provide for gender-neutral maintenance would help to send the correct message that the contributions of stay-at-home husbands are as valued as the care work done by stay-at-home wives.",12,698,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00698
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, many other developed countries allow for men to claim maintenance as well, such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. And there could be others as well. Let us take a leaf from their books.",13,699,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00699
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the UK government’s Guide to Spousal Maintenance, it is stated that “Spousal maintenance is a payment that’s paid by a wife or husband to their former spouse as part of their divorce.” The language used in a similar Australian government public resource is similarly gender-neutral and states  “Under the Family Law Act 1975, a person has a responsibility to financially assist their spouse, or former de facto partner, if that person cannot meet their own reasonable expenses from their personal income or assets.”",14,700,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00700
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In section 63 and 64 of New Zealand’s Family Proceedings Act 1980, gender-neutral language is used. For example, “each spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner is liable to maintain the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner to the extent that such maintenance is necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, where the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner cannot practicably meet the whole or any part of those needs because of any one or more of the circumstances specified in subsection (2).” So, the language is gender neutral. To quote from a court verdict in Ontario, Canada, by Justice Wildman in Hamdy vs Hamdy, just to cite another example ""…gender is, of course, irrelevant in determining spousal support. What is important are the roles assumed in the marriage.""",15,701,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00701
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the 2022 debate on amendments to the Women’s Charter, the Minister of State for Social and Family Development responded to calls to provide maintenance to husbands by stating that the purpose of the current regime is to protect parties who tend to be more financially vulnerable post-divorce, that is, women and incapacitated men. I agree with such an aim.",16,702,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00702
2023-05-08-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, this does not stop the Government from extending the safeguards provided by the maintenance regime to another potentially vulnerable group, namely, stay-at-home husbands.

2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the meantime, the complainant suffers because of the time required to attend Court again and again and the failure to receive the maintenance which had been ordered to be paid to the applicant.",6,732,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00732
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Even if the respondent were to eventually make payment of the arrears of maintenance, there is this possibility that he may default in payment again, then the applicant has to start the process all over again.",7,733,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00733
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, there will be times when an applicant may eventually give up on the maintenance application and decide not to enforce the order. This is unfair to an applicant who has been granted the maintenance.",8,734,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00734
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, Sir, I support the amendments to the Women’s Charter to allow the appointment of the Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEO) in order to have a more sustainable maintenance outcome. The MEOs would then be empowered to carry out investigations on the assets of the respondent and then report to the judge. Without the information given by the MEOs, the applicant who is trying to enforce the maintenance order will have a difficult time trying to check what are the respondent's assets.",9,735,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00735
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In particular, the Courts should be given the powers to act expeditiously and to make interim orders, whenever necessary, to ensure that complainants or applicants who are financially stretched are able to receive the maintenance that they deserve and are entitled to receive; otherwise, the applicant would typically suffer and situations where there are children involved will result in hardship for the family.",10,736,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00736
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Where the MEOs are able to ascertain that the respondent is deliberately refusing to make the maintenance payment, the Court should not hesitate to attach the salary of the respondent or attach his assets in order to enforce the maintenance order. In addition, the Court should consider making an order that the respondent's credit cards be cancelled until the arrears of maintenance are settled.",11,737,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00737
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Where an MEO finds that a respondent’s conduct in refusing to pay the maintenance is contumacious, I would submit that the Court ought to punish the respondent for wasting the time of the applicant, the MEO and the Courts. The respondent should not be able to get away with delaying the maintenance payment just to frustrate the applicant; and then he walks away without consequence once he pays up the arrears.",12,738,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00738
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I recognise that there may be occasions where a respondent may be unable to make payment of the maintenance because his family circumstances have changed. For example, if he loses his job or, sometimes, if the respondent remarries and has to support another family. In situations like these, I expect that the MEO would recommend a variation of the maintenance order.",13,739,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00739
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),May I then ask the Minister how would the Court make a reasonable variation order which can take into account the needs of an applicant who is reliant on the respondent’s maintenance for herself and the children versus the financial needs of the respondent who now has to support another wife and possibly his other children?,14,740,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00740
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),May I also ask whether the MEO is able to investigate and deal with cases where a respondent resigns from his job and has no more income as he simply wishes to deny maintenance payable to the applicant? The loss of income in this case is or would be self-induced with the intent of denying the applicant the maintenance which she ought to be entitled to.,15,741,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00741
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),How would the Court also deal with situations where a respondent refuses to pay child maintenance because he is denied access or visitation rights to the child? Will the Court be able to deal with such situations even though the application before the Court is an enforcement of maintenance application? Or would the Court require a separate application for enforcement of the access rights?,16,742,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00742
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, the next part of the Bill which I wish to speak on is the enhancement of judge-led approach in considering the wishes of the child.",17,743,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00743
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, in the media release by MinLaw, it was stated that the Bill will provide clarity that where the wishes of the child are to be considered by the Court, the judge may conduct interviews with the child.",18,744,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00744
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The current legal position is that the Court in making decisions about the child may appoint a Child Representative to the Court or the Court can appoint a trained or professional assessor to make recommendations on the child’s custody or access orders. The appointed assessor would then prepare a Social Welfare Report, or a Custody Evaluation Report or an Access Evaluation Report.",19,745,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00745
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),The judge may also ascertain the wishes of the child by conducting an interview with the child and there has been case laws on the power of the judge to do so.,20,746,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00746
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"However, may I express some reservations about a judge carrying out interviews of the child because a judge is typically an authority in the law. He or she is not a trained child counsellor who can discern whether a child has been coached to express certain views or is under duress to say positive things about one parent just by one interview. Although some judges may have some degree of training in handling children, the reality is that a judge spends more time analysing the law and the facts applicable to the case.",21,747,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00747
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, unless a judge spends a much, much longer period of time talking with and interviewing the child, I do have some reservations whether a judge is able to make a better assessment of the wishes of a child by a simple interview, compared to trained social workers who will be spending more time talking and interacting with the child and observing the expressions of the child.",22,748,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00748
2023-05-08-T-021,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, may I ask the Minister to clarify what is the intent of this amendment as the current case law does allow the process. Is it the position of the Government that they prefer that judges carry out the interviews more regularly, as compared to the judge appointing social workers or Child Representative to take care of the child’s interest? At the end of the day, what is important is how to ascertain what is in the best interest of the child. Subject to the above clarifications, Sir, I support the Bill.",23,749,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00749

2023-05-08-T-021,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"While the MEOs could help distinguish between those who cannot afford to pay maintenance and those who have the financial means but refuse to pay, the officers may face challenges if the parties who could have the ability and capability to derive a better income have, indeed, tried his best to do so and chose not to do so to benefit the applicant.",4,754,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00754
2023-05-08-T-021,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, the officers would still need to work on the acceptance of medical certification from medical practitioners to determine if the respondent's medical conditions are reasonable to justify lower maintenance payments or exclusion of possible imprisonment order for failure to show proof of payment.

2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, this Bill will improve Family Court proceedings by reducing acrimony in divorce proceedings, enhancing the judge-led approach and facilitating enforcement of maintenance orders. I have three points to make.",1,772,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00772
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is on the enhanced Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which simplifies the enforcement of maintenance orders.",2,773,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00773
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, the new section 86 allows the Maintenance Enforcement Officer (MEO) to seek Court orders for banks or prescribed third parties to provide information. Can the Minister share who these prescribed third parties may be?",3,774,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00774
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, can the Minister share what are the contemplated timelines that the MEO will seek from the Court for banks and prescribed third parties? Family lawyers have shared with me that banks take time to respond to their requests for information. Can the Minister share if the banks have been consulted on their ability to respond within the contemplated timelines?",4,775,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00775
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, the new section 88 allows an MEO to conduct conciliation sessions to help both parties agree on maintenance. Given that conciliation sessions could be used by a party to delay proceedings, can the Minister share whether there is a limit on the number of conciliation sessions that the MEO can conduct? Can the Minister share what are the consequences for a party if they fail to attend or are clearly not participating in good faith on the conciliation?",5,776,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00776
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fourth, MEOs will be empowered to obtain information from parties and to submit a report to the Court. Can the Minister share what training will be provided to the MEOs to make discovery of the relevant documents and assess the parties’ actual financial positions? Can the Minister elaborate on what the MEO’s report is supposed to set out and whether it will be provided to both parties? Can the Minister also share whether there will be a standard rubric for MEOs to assess parties’ financial positions in preparing the report?",6,777,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00777
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fifth, the Court may vary the original maintenance orders in the MEP. Applicants may think twice before applying under the MEP if their application may lead to their original maintenance orders being varied. Can the Minister clarify if it is only under exceptional circumstances that the Court will vary the original maintenance orders in the MEP? If so, can the Minister share what factors a Court should take into account before varying the original maintenance orders in the MEP?",7,778,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00778
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on the attachment of earnings Court orders. These Court orders direct a party’s employer to deduct a portion of maintenance from their salary to make direct payment to the other party. The new section 91H allows the Court to determine what payments to a person are earnings that can be directed for the payment of maintenance. The relevant sections set out obligations relating to the respondent’s employer and employment when an attachment of earnings order is made. Can the Minister clarify whether earnings from freelance or gig economy work can be deemed earnings? If such earnings can be subject to an attachment of earnings order, can the Minister clarify how the obligations relating to traditional employers or employment apply where the respondent is engaged in gig work?",8,779,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00779
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is on financial counselling for couples undergoing divorce. In the public consultation for the RERF Committee’s recommendations, members of the public asked to build up capabilities in financial counselling to help divorcees better manage their new finances. The new section 91(b) makes progress in this area. It provides the Court with powers to order a party to undergo financial counselling as part of maintenance enforcement proceedings.",9,780,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00780
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But counselling works best when it starts earlier, long before divorce applications are even filed.

2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),MSF may be able to identify families at high-risk of divorce through the various social service agencies and FSCs.

2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Also, given that parents with children under 21 years old must undergo the Mandatory Co-Parenting Programme (CPP) before filing for divorce, can Minister of State Sun Xueling share if there are plans to incorporate mandatory financial counselling and planning as part of the CPP?",12,783,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00783
2023-05-08-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister also clarify where an MEO refers parties for financial assistance after reviewing documents submitted by the parties, will the matter still proceed on to conciliation and hearing?

Compared to the current mediation process, MEOs will be accorded powers to actively seek information and recommend practical solutions to the parties involved. I find this useful, but I do have a few questions on the new MEP.",7,792,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00792
2023-05-08-T-021,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I would like to ask if MEOs will be able to obtain information about assets that are kept outside of Singapore. What kind of training will be provided to MEOs to ensure that they understand and are equipped to apply their new powers? Would it be an offence for a person to refuse to comply with an MEO’s direction to seek financial assistance, just to vex the ex-spouse and not provide any maintenance? I look forward to the Minister's clarifications.",8,793,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00793

Let us continue to work, as a whole of society, to strengthen marriages and family ties. Sir, I support the Bill.",12,797,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00797

2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, data published in 2021 by the Department of Statistics Singapore showed that the general trend of divorce rates is increasing in Singapore, with 7.2 male divorcees for every 1,000 married men, up from 6.3 in 2020; and 6.9 female divorcees up from 6.1 in 2020.",1,799,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00799
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Although Singapore, as a society, is primarily anchored on family-centric values, with the Government and the community at large encouraging marriages and supportive of couples through their marriages, we acknowledge that some marriages may inevitably break down, due to multifaceted factors.",2,800,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00800
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"We do need to help couples deal with the fall-out from the break-up of their marriage and help both parties move on with their lives, especially if there are children involved. Therefore, I am very supportive of the introduction of the Family Justice Reform Bill. However, I would like to raise two considerations. One, with regard to the new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) and two, on the non-payment of maintenance and how the process could be enhanced to support more applicants, especially the vulnerable ones.",3,801,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00801
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, the enhanced MEP starts with applicants applying online for enforcement. Like my concerns shared in my previous speech on the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill relating to the process of applying for Lasting Power of Attorney, the process for the enforcement of maintenance assumes that all applicants are tech-savvy and will not have any difficulties applying online.",4,802,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00802
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Nevertheless, we know that there will be cases where applicants are not tech-savvy and may be discouraged to submit an online enforcement application because they are unable to do so readily, even if they are facing financial hardship. I wonder if MSF and MinLaw could work together to identify vulnerable individuals, such as low-income single parents, or divorcees with special needs or disabilities, including those due to stroke, that would require more support in their application and enforcement for maintenance.",5,803,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00803
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"A suggestion is for MinLaw and MSF to consider empowering Social Service Office (SSO) or social workers with the role to act on behalf of such applicants, in their navigation of the online application and appropriate referral to the Family Justice Court if they are found to require additional attention to expedite enforcement of their maintenance, especially where the welfare of young children is at stake.",6,804,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00804
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, I would like to raise another consideration with the enforcement of maintenance. In the Bill, amendments are proposed to the Women's Charter in section 71 to empower the Court to make attachment of earning order for maintenance to secure payment of any maintenance from the respondent. Additionally, the Bill added a new section 81 to the Women's Charter to provide directions to the Court on the orders that it may or must make on a maintenance enforcement application, which included a Show-Payment Order and, when breached, the respondent is liable for imprisonment.",7,805,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00805
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Despite these safeguards, there may be instances where respondents continue to act irresponsibly and are defiant to these orders, failing to pay maintenance, especially after one year from the hearing. In such instances, I would like to ask what powers and directions the Courts are vested with to ensure that the maintenance order would be fully enforced within a reasonable stipulated time, for the respondents to be brought to task expediently to reduce hardship on the applicants needing the maintenance.",8,806,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00806
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to cite the example of my resident, Mdm Goh, as one such single mother who needs more help from MSF and MinLaw for enforcing the maintenance from her divorced husband. Mdm Goh came to my Meet-the-People Session some weeks back to seek help on financial assistance. She is a single mother in her early 30s with three young children, aged three to seven.",9,807,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00807
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Following her divorce a couple of years ago, while the Court has ordered her former husband to pay about $1,200 monthly maintenance to her and their three children, he has not done so. Mdm Goh started applying for enforcement but has been stuck for a while as the Court informed her that her former husband has an outstanding warrant of arrest, which renders the enforcement of maintenance not possible until his arrest. He has not been contactable.",10,808,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00808
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Meanwhile, Mdm Goh has been relying on ComCare support, which was reduced recently. While she understands that ComCare assistance is provided only for short to mid-term and she needs to get a job, she has only been able to convince employers to let her work on daily hour-rated jobs because of her need to rush home to care for her young children before and after school or childcare hours, alone. She also has to wrestle with her bankruptcy status due to her former husband using her name against her will for a loan on which he defaulted. Her own parents struggle with mental health challenges and are deemed unsuitable for caregiving of her young children by social workers assisting her.",11,809,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00809
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Goh has been anxious and desperate. Thankful to SSO's help to my appeal, she is given some ComCare extension while I assist her in finding jobs nearer to her home. Given her unresolved maintenance payments from her former husband, which may never be paid, she may be a genuine single parent who will require ComCare assistance to be maintained at a level for a few more years until her two younger children also enter primary school and when she can hopefully find a full-time job with her ITE qualification.",12,810,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00810
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Goh's case shows the necessity to emphasise Therapeutic Justice and assistance for vulnerable divorcees, with both MSF and MinLaw coordinating the processes to render needful assistance so that the divorcees and their children do not fall into hardship due to unintended policy gaps. Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to say some words in Mandarin.",13,811,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00811
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent years, our divorce rate has been on the rise. Therefore, it is extremely important to simplify and strengthen our family justice process. I strongly support the Family Justice Reform Bill jointly drafted by MinLaw and MSF. This will allow marriages to end in a harmonious manner and safeguard the welfare of the children through a therapeutic justice system. I have two suggestions on the Bill which I hope MinLaw and MSF will consider.",14,812,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00812
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"First, the family justice process set out in the Bill requires divorcees to apply for maintenance online. I am worried that online applications will deter divorcees who are not tech-savvy and will indirectly affect them and their children's welfare. I hope MinLaw and MSF will work together to identify vulnerable groups who need help, such as low-income divorcees who are single parents, and provide more social assistance to help them claim maintenance effectively. I also hope that MinLaw and MSF can authorise social workers to apply to the Court for alimony on behalf of the divorcee when necessary, such as when the welfare of the children is seriously affected.",15,813,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00813
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, I would like to relate the story of my resident, Mdm Goh. In the process of claiming maintenance, the Court issued a warrant of arrest but Mdm Goh's ex-husband was not contactable, hence, the alimony could not be claimed. Mdm Goh had to raise three children on her own and struggled financially because she could not get any maintenance. Her story illustrated the importance of therapeutic justice. I hope that MinLaw and MSF will provide more social assistance in cases, such as Mdm Goh's, and to help them claim maintenance.",16,814,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00814
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, given that most divorces are likely to occur between five and nine years of marriage, the psychological impact towards separation and divorce can be substantial and long-lasting. This is even more so if the couples have young children. Hence, let me conclude my speech by affirming the efforts of MinLaw and MSF in their determination to reform and strengthen Therapeutic Justice elements in the family justice system.",17,815,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00815
2023-05-08-T-021,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Additionally, I also hope that this Bill will help vulnerable individuals, especially those that may have been through an abusive marriage, to regain themselves swiftly and rebuild their lives.

2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill will introduce the enhanced Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) to facilitate maintenance outcomes for parties and will put our Judiciary in a good position to strengthen and mete out Therapeutic Justice in the divorce process.",1,818,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00818
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In my law practice, I handle some matrimonial cases on a pro bono basis. One such case was when I was assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau to represent a young mother of four in a divorce proceeding. That case shaped my thinking on how we can and should make it easier for estranged spouses to claim maintenance for their children when divorce occurs. Please allow me to share her story.",2,819,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00819
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Wati, not her real name, was only 19 years old when she got married and, as such, she was not named as a joint owner of the HDB flat that she lived with her husband because she was not yet 21 years old. Unfortunately, she was in an abusive relationship, suffering under the hands of an abusive husband she once loved. She was a housewife with no other sources of income and was wholly dependent on the sole breadwinner. She endured the strain of the relationship and the pain of the abuse and held on because of her young children. She would have had a fifth child if not for a miscarriage that she suffered after a beating so bad that she was hospitalised for a week. The doctors had to perform a hysterectomy and she can never have another child ever again.",3,820,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00820
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Finally, she mustered enough courage to seek divorce. However, she was faced back then with a system that was cumbersome and daunting for a single mother to navigate. The ex-spouse had sought to kick her and the children out of the matrimonial flat because she was not listed as an owner and refused to agree to any division of assets in her favour. She finally sought help from the Legal Aid Bureau.",4,821,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00821
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"She had to go to the Family Court, as it then was, to seek enforcement and variation of maintenance orders to feed her children and, at the same time, sort out her divorce proceedings before the Syariah Court, a Court case that was protracted by the ex-spouse all the way to the appellate stage.",5,822,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00822
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I recalled the maintenance order which, I found, was out of the ordinary. Typically, such orders would set out the amount to be paid for each child or spouse and the bank account details for such sums to be deposited. However, this one had not only the usual quantum and such details, but it also specified exactly what items that this ex-spouse had to purchase for the children, things like baby formula milk, diapers and even to specify the type of necessities – basic stuff like food and educational expenses. What kind of parent must be told and compelled to purchase sustenance for his own children? The ex-spouse had not only protracted proceedings but also taken such acrimonious and unreasonable positions which necessitated such specific orders.",6,823,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00823
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Eventually, the appellate Court held that she had a share and interest in the flat, notwithstanding that she was not listed as an owner.

2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Throughout her ordeal, she almost gave up. She told me that she was fortunate to receive legal aid. Others may not have such fortunate ending.",8,825,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00825
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Wati's case highlighted to me the need for us to facilitate the maintenance enforcement process for any parent, whether man or woman, to seek what is rightfully their children's and to alleviate some of the burden that they carry after divorce.",9,826,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00826

2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I also welcome the protection of family violence survivors through limited cross-examination in certain circumstances. As raised in previous Parliamentary speeches, I hope that there can be default video conferencing facilities within the Family Justice Court (FJC) for young survivors to give evidence. This is to insulate them from further trauma on the stand. I understand that such infrastructure is already part of MinLaw's plans and I look forward to the implementation in this regard.",11,828,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00828
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),I have the following further clarifications and suggestions.,12,829,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00829
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, on Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEO), I hope to hear more the plans on recruitment, resourcing and training of such MEOs, especially given the caseload on the Courts and enforcement of not just FJC Court orders but also Syariah Court orders as well. Further, as MEOs encounter members of the public and, to a certain degree, may face hostile respondents or uncooperative third parties, may I ask what are the protection and immunity that will be accorded to MEOs?",13,830,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00830
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, can the Ministry consider having all such maintenance orders reflected on a searchable database registry that can be accessed on a ""need-to-know"" basis by financial institutions or public agencies? This is to allow would-be public service employers and banks to conduct due diligence for checks on background or credit worthiness.",14,831,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00831
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Thirdly, on claiming for past outstanding maintenance, one clarification that I have received is whether there is a time limitation period to make such claims under the MEP. Typically, as in the story I shared earlier, the victim would have had to endure many years of unpaid maintenance through protracted proceedings. So, not everyone would make a claim immediately upon breach.",15,832,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00832
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Fourthly, in some cases, there are other competing creditors. The usual refrain from the ex-spouse is that he or she had to pay off other loans or financial commitments first. The financial strain on the paying party is real. We need to balance their interests, too. This is especially in cases where the respondent has been declared bankrupt. In most cases, the applicant is unlikely to be able to recover any monies from an insolvent respondent. Hence, in this situation, what are the additional support that can be rendered to both parties?",16,833,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00833
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I understand that the reforms do not change the order of the priorities of an insolvent debtor. In bankruptcy proceedings, if there had been unfair preference or transactions at undervalue, those assets can be clawed back. Hence, I look forward to understanding how the proposed MEP and the current bankruptcy regime will work together.",17,834,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00834
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, what are the steps that MinLaw, together with MSF, will take to raise awareness of the MEP and render assistance to laypersons who do not know how to navigate the claims and applications? I also hope that the MEP will also apply equally for the enforcement of Syariah Court orders, especially on maintenance-like orders on payment of nafkah iddah and mutaah. In Malay, please, Sir.",18,835,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00835
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] This amendment Bill will help applicants, like ex-spouses, to receive any outstanding maintenance much faster and allow the Courts, through its officers and special office, such as the MEO, to obtain the latest information on the financial status and income of relevant parties. This is a welcome change.",19,836,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00836
2023-05-08-T-021,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In the past, as I had shared earlier in the case of Mdm Wati, not her real name, the process of receiving her child's maintenance not only took a long time, but it was also mentally exhausting and left her feeling dispirited. When a marriage ends, the couple should separate amicably, because even though they are no longer a family, the family ties and the love between the parents and their children should never cease to exist. I hope, with this new process, we can ensure that the child's maintenance can be provisioned as soon as possible and the responsibility of providing maintenance as a parent can be carried out.",20,837,2023-05-08-T-021-S-00837

2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Louis Ng also asked about the contemplated timelines to disclose information sought. We have been engaging the banks and third parties that we intend to prescribe and we will work with them to implement the MEP, which would include response timelines.",9,856,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00856
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Murali Pillai also raised the concern that assets may be held in the name of proxies. Mr Pillai also requested for clarification on the ambit of a “third party” under the Bill and whether a third party may be asked to disclose information relating to proxies. The third party may be any person who has relevant information. Thus, if an MEO, in the course of fact-finding, has reason to suspect that the respondent has assets that are held in the name of proxies, the MEO may seek a Court order for a third party to disclose information about the assets. It is for the Court to decide if such information is relevant to the enforcement application.",10,857,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00857
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"There are limits to the MEOs’ powers to uncover every fact. It is, ultimately, the primary responsibility of the parties to be forthright about their true financial positions. Furnishing false information, when asked by an MEO, or to the Court, is a criminal offence.",11,858,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00858
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Louis Ng asked about the number of conciliation sessions and the consequences for failing to attend or not participating in good faith. The Bill does not impose a limit on the number of conciliation sessions. We envisage that there will, typically, be two sessions, but the exact number will vary. It is the Court that directs the parties to attend conciliation. Failure to attend is, therefore, contempt of Court.",12,859,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00859
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Further, if the respondent is absent from conciliation, the Court may direct the respondent to attend another conciliation session. The Court may also proceed with the hearing of the application. If the respondent is absent for the hearing of the application, the new Family Justice Rules will allow the Court to proceed to make the appropriate orders, if certain conditions are satisfied. This should also address Ms Ng Ling Ling’s question about her resident whose application got “stuck” because the ex-husband could not be found.",13,860,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00860

The Court may take the parties’ conduct into account in making the appropriate orders on the maintenance enforcement application.",14,861,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00861
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Louis Ng asked whether the matter will still proceed to hearing after the MEO refers parties for financial assistance. Financial assistance is not intended to replace the parties’ financial responsibilities to their families, but acts as a safety net for our fellow Singaporeans in need. The matter will, therefore, still proceed for conciliation and hearing after the MEO makes the referral for financial assistance. The MEO will take into account the financial assistance granted, if any, as part of the overall assessment of the financial circumstances of the parties. The Court will also take into consideration information on any financial assistance granted, in deciding on the appropriate orders to be made.",15,862,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00862
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Melvin Yong asked about whether it is an offence for a respondent to refuse financial assistance, despite an MEO's referral. The answer is no. It is open to a respondent to decide whether to accept financial assistance.",16,863,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00863
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),I will turn to Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan's queries on what the MEO’s report will set out and whether the reports will be provided to both parties.,17,864,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00864
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),The MEO’s final report will be provided to both parties and submitted to the Court. It will contain all the information submitted to the MEO in relation to the maintenance enforcement application; matters relating to the conciliation sessions; and any other matters and information as may be prescribed.,18,865,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00865
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"In respect of interim reports, the clause which Mr Dennis Tan referred to allows the MEO to provide an interim report to the applicant only, first, to cater for a situation where the MEO needs to inform the applicant of an impending dissipation of assets so that appropriate action can be taken. The intent is for the interim report to eventually be available to both parties in accordance with the rules.",19,866,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00866
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The intention is for the MEO to provide all relevant facts and evidence for the Court’s consideration. The Court may then, if it thinks fit, rely on the MEO’s report to make the appropriate orders against the respondent’s assets, without calling for further evidence. We may prescribe additional matters to be covered in the report, as we learn from the initial phases of implementation.",20,867,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00867
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Dennis Tan has also asked what information may be redacted from the MEO's report. The MEO has broad powers to gather information for the Court from third parties, including information that is ordinarily private and confidential. The MEO reports this to the Court. There may be information gathered by the MEO and in the report that is unnecessary or irrelevant. This power will allow for such information to be redacted to protect the party's interests.",21,868,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00868
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),Mr Louis Ng and Mr Melvin Yong also asked whether there is a standard rubric for MEOs to assess the parties’ financial position. Mr Gan Thiam Poh referred to challenges with distinguishing between those who will not pay and cannot pay cases. Both Mr Gan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan cited examples of respondents who have the ability to earn an income or better income but chose not to do so.,22,869,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00869
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"There is no fixed formula to determine whether a respondent has the means to pay maintenance. Each case will be assessed on its facts, based on information on the parties’ assets and means.",23,870,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00870
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"That being said, the MEOs will be trained and given guidelines on making these assessments. We will work closely with Social Service Officers from MSF to develop these guidelines. Ultimately, it is for the Court to decide whether the respondent cannot pay or refuses to pay, and the appropriate orders to make. The Court will consider the MEO’s report in coming to its decision.",24,871,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00871
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),The FJC judges are trained to deal with a wide range of family situations and also have the powers to make orders to address the unique needs of each family. They will also be supported by counsellors and other professionals who will be able to provide therapeutic interventions.,25,872,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00872
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"For example, if a respondent is retrenched and has challenges paying maintenance due to the sudden loss of income, the Court may suspend the maintenance order or vary the maintenance amount downwards for a short period of time and make the appropriate directions for the respondent to report back to the Court on a specified date after he or she has had time to look for a new job. The Court may also make an order requiring the respondent to undergo financial counselling with a professional counsellor who will be able to help the respondent explore various options to manage his or her daily expenses and to pay maintenance.",26,873,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00873
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also suggested that the MEOs may also assist the Court at the stage of division of matrimonial assets.

These are operational details that will be worked through in implementation. Suffice to say that we intend to hire and train a multidisciplinary team, with team members having or being trained and equipped with knowledge and skills in different areas. This will include the skills needed to effectively manage the parties in family proceedings.",28,875,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00875
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),We also thank Ms Hany Soh for her suggestion on taking a coordinated approach across the entire family justice ecosystem.

2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Zhulkarnain has asked about legal protections for the MEOs.

2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),I will now address the questions and comments that Members have raised with respect to the powers of the Court hearing the maintenance enforcement application.,31,878,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00878
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"First, on the Court's powers to vary the maintenance orders. Mr Louis Ng expressed concern that the potential for variation may disincentivise some applicants from applying for enforcement. Mr Lim Biow Chuan also asked about variation where the respondent loses his or her job or if he or she has a new family.",32,879,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00879
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The MEP does not change the substantive law in relation to variation of maintenance orders  the test that the respondent has to satisfy remains the same. What the MEP does is to reduce the procedural challenges that parties face in seeking variation. For example, the Court may vary a maintenance order made during matrimonial proceedings only when it is satisfied that  the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact; or where there has been any material change in circumstances.",33,880,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00880
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"The Court will consider all relevant facts and circumstances before deciding whether there has been any change in circumstances warranting a variation of the maintenance order. New financial commitments and loss of job could be relevant considerations. However, the Courts have held that remarriage per se does not affect pre-existing obligations owed to the family from an earlier marriage.",34,881,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00881
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Similarly, when MEOs make recommendations to parties to facilitate an out-of-Court settlement, remarriage and loss of job are but two of the various factors that will be considered. Maintenance orders would not be varied in cases where the respondent has the means to pay the maintenance sum.",35,882,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00882
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"In cases where the respondent has genuinely experienced a change in circumstances affecting his or her ability to pay maintenance, the MEP will help the Court make a more accurate assessment of the nature of the change and accordingly make more accurate variation orders where needed. This can be a temporary variation to deal with a temporary change in circumstances, but it leads to a more sustainable outcome for all parties.",36,883,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00883
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"On the other hand, if we turn a blind eye to the changed circumstances, respondents will continue to miss maintenance payments time and time again, even if multiple enforcement applications are made and concluded against them. Applicants will spend time and costs on enforcement, only to end up being disappointed each time.",37,884,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00884
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"It would be far better for such applicants to receive the appropriate financial assistance and other forms of support, or enter into a more sustainable maintenance arrangement with the respondent. The new MEP facilitates this.",38,885,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00885
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also asked about the circumstances in which a respondent would not be imprisoned, or lower maintenance amounts ordered, because of his or her medical conditions. These are decisions that are, ultimately, for the Court to make, taking into account all the circumstances of the case.",39,886,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00886
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Where there are disputes of fact, for example, on the medical conditions of the respondent, the MEO may help to gather the relevant facts and evidence, including seeking information from third parties to verify the parties' positions. The Court may also direct the MEOs to conduct further fact-finding, if necessary.",40,887,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00887
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"On attachment of earnings orders, Mr Ng asked whether earnings from freelance or gig economy work are earnings that may be attached. ""Earnings"" for the purpose of attachment of earnings orders is defined in the new section 76 of the Women's Charter to refer to wages or salary payable under a contract of service.",41,888,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00888
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Therefore, depending on the way the contractual relationship between the worker and the firm is structured, it may well be that, in some cases, such earnings may fall within the definition of ""earnings"". Attachment of earnings orders work effectively where there is a regular and stable stream of income that can be directed towards the fulfilment of periodical maintenance payments.",42,889,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00889
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"They do not work so well where the income is unpredictable, such as for freelancers and contract workers. Including such arrangements may lead to hardship for the parties and administrative challenges for the firms who engage these workers. Hence, attachment of earnings orders will, generally, not be made in respect of income from gig work, which is unstable.",43,890,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00890
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Where incomes are not stable, the family's financial situation is naturally more complicated and it is not always easy to find simple solutions. The MEOs will help parties look at the overall picture and suggest arrangements that are sustainable. Ultimately, regardless of the type of work one does, the respondent must be responsible for fulfilling his or her obligations for maintenance. Even if the attachment of earnings order is not available, there are various other ways to hold them accountable.",44,891,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00891

2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Lim also asked about situations where the respondent refuses to pay because he or she is denied access to the child. Being denied access is not grounds for non-compliance with a maintenance order. A parent has a legal duty to maintain a child, whether the child is in his or her custody or not. If the respondent is denied access to the child, he or she may take up an application for the enforcement of the access order.",47,894,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00894

2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),Mr Zhulkarnain suggested that all maintenance orders be placed on a searchable database registry and that a recalcitrant defaulter can be placed on a blacklist with an alert to the Credit Service Bureau. The Women's Charter already provides for an Applicant who has filed for maintenance enforcement to be able to lodge a report to a designated credit bureau regarding unpaid arrears stated on the order of Court. Applicants will continue to be able to lodge such reports under the new MEP.,49,896,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00896

2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"Mr Gan has also asked whether maintenance payments will be prioritised over other debts. Mr Zhulkarnain has asked for clarification on how the new MEP and the bankruptcy regime will interface with each other. As Mr Zhulkarnain has correctly mentioned, the reforms in this Bill do not change the order of priorities of an insolvent debtor. The reforms also do not change how enforcement proceedings or orders ordinarily interact with the bankruptcy regime.",51,898,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00898

Dr Wan Rizal raised concerns of harshness on parties genuinely unable to pay. Mr Zhulkarnain mentioned that for bankrupt respondents, applicants are unlikely to be able to recover any arrears but yet are saddled with the expenses of the children.",52,899,2023-05-08-T-023-S-00899
2023-05-08-T-023,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam),"This is where the reforms under the MEP may be helpful.

If they are below 35 years old, they can retain their flat if they include a family member, such as either of their parents, to form an eligible family nucleus.

But even just counting those that were reported, the amount lost to scams worldwide grew by about 16% from 2020 to over $77 billion in 2021.",2,978,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00978
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In Singapore, the number of scams has also increased sharply. Police reported that scam cases exceeded 31,000 in 2022. This is more than a fivefold increase since 2018. Scam cases are now more than one-and-a-half times that of physical crime. Back in 2018, they were only a quarter.",3,979,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00979
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The amount of money lost to scams is staggering. In 2022 alone, victims lost $660 million. Since 2018, close to $2 billion. Many of us know or have personally heard stories of people who have fallen prey. They include elderly Singaporeans who lost their life savings. Younger Singaporeans are not immune. In fact, more than half of scam victims in 2022 were aged 20 to 39. Victims often lose more than money – they lose peace of mind, sense of well-being, relations with family sometimes become very strained and all of these things bring about great distress.",4,980,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00980
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Many scams in Singapore have an overseas nexus. We cannot stop the global tide but must do everything we can to try and keep the scammers far from shore. The Bills we are debating today are part of the Government's multi-pronged strategy to fight scams. We have been educating the public so that they are aware of the signs of scam and know what actions they can take to protect themselves.,5,981,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00981
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Members would have seen the public campaign, ""I can ACT against Scams"", or hosted outreach sessions by Police officers in their constituency events involving residents. We have taken proactive measures to prevent scammers from being able to reach victims in the first place. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has been working with the telcos to block spoofed calls from reaching Singaporeans. Every month, close to 60 million calls are blocked.",6,982,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00982
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We launched the ScamShield app in November 2020, which has been downloaded more than 550,000 times and filtered out more than 7.4 million SMSes that are suspected to be part of a scam. Earlier this Sitting, we tabled the Online Criminal Harms Bill. Among other things, the Online Criminal Harms Bill will help to stop potential scams from taking place, or as soon as they are detected.",7,983,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00983
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We have also made it easier to detect and report scams and follow-up with partners. The Police set up the Anti-Scam Command in 2022 to consolidate expertise and resources in combatting scams. Staff from the major banks are co-located with the Police, so that all the parties can quickly act together to freeze scam-tainted accounts. With the help of our foreign partners, Police brought down 13 scam syndicates in 2022. More than 70 persons based overseas were arrested.",8,984,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00984
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The Bills we are proposing today will add to our suite of anti-scam measures outlined above. We propose to empower the authorities to deal more effectively with money mules and to prevent the abuse of Singpass for scam operations.,9,985,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00985
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, let me explain the role of money mules. They are individuals who allow criminals to control their bank or other payment accounts. They also include those who use their accounts to receive or transfer monies under the criminals' instructions. Some Members may recall the OCBC phishing scam that occurred between December 2021 and January 2022 – 790 victims fell prey. The total losses amounted to $13.7 million. In this scam, the Police identified more than 120 suspected money mules. More than 120 local bank accounts were used to receive the scam victims' monies.",10,986,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00986
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Why do the scammers need money mules? Scam syndicates typically cultivate a network of money mules to facilitate their crimes or to launder criminal proceeds. The money mules' bank accounts form a web of multiple accounts; scammed monies can be split into different denominations and transferred through these accounts. This process is repeated many times over, so that the monies go through multiple layers of bank accounts, before being transferred out of Singapore into the hands of the syndicate. This tactic of ""layering"" is designed to make it difficult for the authorities to follow the money trail and to get to the perpetrators.",11,987,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00987
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Between 2020 and 2022, scammers exploited more than 38,000 bank accounts to launder their proceeds from local victims. Over the same period, more than 19,000 money mules were investigated by the Police. One big problem for the Police is that with electronic transactions, all these actions that I described earlier happen very quickly, often in a matter of hours.",12,988,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00988
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Another problem is that when interviewed by the Police, most of the money mules claimed they did not know that they were handling illegal funds. They claimed not to have known the identity of the person who instructed them, nor the identity of the bank account holders whom they were receiving funds from or transferring funds to. Many agreed to facilitate these money transfers because they were paid to do so. They claimed that they did not think that they were doing anything illegal and did not know they were dealing with criminal proceeds.",13,989,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00989
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The fact is, however, that their actions caused great harm to scam victims, whose monies have been moved beyond reach, beyond our ability to recover. Besides money mules, the Police have also observed a trend of scam syndicates abusing Singpass to facilitate their criminal activities. For example, syndicates recruit Singpass users with the promise of monetary gain and then use the Singpass accounts to further their schemes.",14,990,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00990
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Scam syndicates who get hold of another person's Singpass credentials can use them to open bank accounts, which are then used to receive and transfer funds obtained through scams. Irresponsible Singpass users have facilitated this by selling or sharing their Singpass credentials, such as their Singpass password and SMS one-time password. Scam syndicates effectively assume the identity of a Singpass user for their criminal activities and exploit the Singpass account to commit criminal activities while hiding their own tracks. As a result, these scam syndicates are extremely difficult to pursue.",15,991,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00991
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Sir, we must do everything we can to prevent scams from harming Singaporeans. This includes recognising the limitations of current laws, which make it difficult to take the money mules to task. It requires the Prosecution to prove that the money mule had knowledge or reasonable grounds to believe that the monies transacted through his bank account are linked to criminal activity. As a result of these difficulties, of the 19,000 money mules investigated by Police from 2020 to 2022, fewer than 250 money mules were eventually prosecuted. Out of 19,000, fewer than 250 ended up being prosecuted.",16,992,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00992
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the OCBC phishing scam which I mentioned earlier, out of the 120 suspected money mules, only nine could be charged for money mule offences. Think about that, it is fewer than one in 10. Similarly, it has been challenging to prove the wrongful intention of those who give up their Singpass credentials under existing laws like the Computer Misuse Act.",17,993,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00993
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Clearly, there is a gap that has allowed money mules to continue abetting scammers at little cost to themselves. Why should they be deterred if they can evade prosecution by simply claiming ignorance?",18,994,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00994
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The two sets of amendments we are proposing are, therefore, intended to strengthen our collective defence against scams.",19,995,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00995
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, it sets guardrails on the use of bank and Singpass accounts. Bank account holders and Singpass users must be careful and exercise diligence regarding their bank accounts and Singpass credentials. Our bank accounts and Singpass accounts are for our own use. We should not allow them to be used by another person, especially if we do not know who the other party is or what the transactions are for.",20,996,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00996
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, the amendments will empower the Police to act more effectively against those who blatantly ignore these guardrails, and abuse or allow to be abused, their bank accounts and Singpass credentials to perpetrate scams and other crimes.",21,997,2023-05-08-T-024-S-00997
2023-05-08-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I will first explain the proposed amendments to the CDSA.

A was told that he would be paid $2,000 a month to receive money using his personal bank account and all he had to do was to transfer sums of more than $100,000 to other bank accounts weekly.

B did not know what his bank account was used for. B claimed that he did not suspect anything wrong with the arrangement despite receiving this quite easy $800. Investigations found that his bank account was used to receive about $20,000 from a Singaporean victim of a love scam.

2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Currently, between 2020 and 2022, out of the more than 19,000 money mule cases investigated by the Police, only less than 250 cases were eventually prosecuted, as explained by the hon Minister. These cases involved amounts of more than $440 million. That is almost 20% of the entire scams in terms of quantum.",6,1041,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01041
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),Money mules are a key part of scammers' operations here in Singapore and I agree that there is a lacuna in the law that needs to be plugged.,7,1042,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01042
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Currently, the evidential challenge is to prove that money mules have actual knowledge or intent to facilitate such criminal activities. Further, money mules are currently charged under the Computer Misuse Act for abetting a person to gain access to the bank account without authority. This provision does not seem the most appropriate for the acts committed. Hence, I welcome the changes proposed by the Bill and their direct intervention in this regard.",8,1043,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01043
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My firm is part of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) acting for accused persons on a pro bono basis and we see some of these cases. From experience, not all alleged money mules fit the typical stereotype of a criminal scammer. Some of them claim or maybe are as much victims of circumstances as the scammed victims themselves.",9,1044,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01044
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"If I may share a case about one such young accused person that walked through our office doors. Aged 19, he was serving his NS. He saw a job advertisement and responded to it with the intention of working to support his family of seven and supplement the income of the sole breadwinner. He ended up giving up control of his bank account and Singpass to an unknown person in return for payment. He thought this is his income or salary. Easy come, easy go. But it was too good to be true. Call it youthful brashfulness. He faces charges now, accused of being a money mule.",10,1045,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01045
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Besides that case, I have also received appeals during my Meet-the-People Sessions from families in Keat Hong who also faced similar situations. Mostly, these money mules were lured by the prospect of job opportunities and some were scammed out of their savings and forced to act as money mules in order to regain some of those monies back. We must ensure that the amendments strike a balance between protecting the public and also meting out the appropriate penalties commensurate to the crime and culpability.",11,1046,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01046
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The proposed amendments to the law will place the burden on the accused money mule to prove that he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure of his or her Singpass was lawful and to take reasonable steps to ascertain the purpose of the person accessing the account and the source of funds and/or the person's identity in relation to the bank account. I think this is commonsensical. In practice, it is likely that the person will face difficulty to prove otherwise and may be found guilty under the amended provisions. This is despite the fact that he or she may not have had any knowledge as to how the bank account was being used.",12,1047,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01047
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"There are various offences, such as rash or negligent money laundering, where the accused money mule has a suspicion that the monies could be criminal proceeds but chose not to verify the legitimacy of such funds. If I may ask, what would be the reasonable steps that a person can take to make such verifications? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider forming a public reporting office which provides an avenue through the anti-scam hotline or an enhancement on the ScamShield app for members of the public and those who genuinely intend to make such verifications. This way, a person can just make a call, alert the agencies or banks of such offer or make verifications for such transactions before it is being made. This can come under the suspicious transactions reporting office for AML transactions, something which our ordinary members of the public may not be aware of.",13,1048,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01048
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, the burden of proof is about to shift, some say, in a drastic manner. I wonder if the Ministry may wish to consider delaying the implementation of the amendments while carrying out public education events as to the seriousness of such offences. Because the advertisements are framed as job advertisements, many young persons or even older ones may not appreciate that. Just by letting another person access their Singpass or bank account, they are committing a serious offence. Or as the Minister mentioned, the disclosing of their Singpass credentials.",14,1049,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01049
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In addition, such awareness campaigns should be done in concert with the banks and financial institutions, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and potential employers as well. The risk and dangers of being used as money mules can be amplified through our job seeking portals to alert potential jobseekers of the scams and pitfalls out there.",15,1050,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01050
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, I agree with the amendments under the Computer Misuse Act to protect the use of our Singpass credentials. In this regard, may I also suggest that for vulnerable members of our society, like the elderly and adults with special needs, that any changes or unauthorised access to their Singpass accounts also be notified to their next-of-kin, guardian or adult children.",16,1051,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01051
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I raised in this House previously about one of my Keat Hong residents, who is an adult with special needs, and how he was scammed into signing up for various phone lines by scammers and that his elderly parents were helpless to prevent the scam. We need to have a more robust way of protecting the vulnerable groups of our society. Perhaps, the use of data analytics to see the pattern of access by such groups can also help alert or red flag any sudden unathorised access. What are the steps that the Ministry will take to bolster such protection? Perhaps, before any changes to access to such Singpass accounts can be made, there can be a two-factor authentication to be approved by the next-of-kin, guardian or their adult children.",17,1052,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01052
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister for clarifying about the cases of sharing Singpass credentials for genuine legitimate purposes and also where the elderly seek help to access their Singpass accounts. So, when I do my house visits and my AICs, the volunteers are quite aware in this regard.",18,1053,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01053
2023-05-08-T-024,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are working and walking in the right direction to stop the scourge of scams in our midst. This does not just affect the elderly but also the young who are looking for jobs and to earn a decent and honest living, and maybe may not have had the full brunt of life experiences before them. Our people's hard-earned money and lifesavings are at risk and at stake and, with that, their hopes and aspirations for a better future. I stand in support of the Bills.",19,1054,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01054

2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, in the past few years, Members of Parliament have encountered residents whose lives have been devastated by online crimes, such as scams. Not only have these victims lost significant amounts of hard-earned monies or retirement savings, they also lived with the mental anguish and guilt of being gullible enough to fall for such deception. Often, the victims were vulnerable in certain ways and susceptible to exploitation, such as those who live alone and are desperate for friends to chat with, or those searching for a life partner, who then become the victim of a love scam.",1,1056,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01056
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),Some may blame the victims for being foolish or authors of their own misfortune. But this ignores the fact that we are dealing here with perpetrators who are parts of organised syndicates who appear well-trained to find targets. Their criminal behaviour is truly despicable.,2,1057,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01057
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"After their ordeals, victims usually report the matter to the Police, hoping that their monies can be recovered or, at the very least, that the perpetrators would be arrested, prosecuted and punished. Due to the organised nature of scams, which are often transnational, Police have the unenviable task of informing victims that their chances of recovering their monies are often slim. Such news to a younger victim is certainly bad news, but at least he or she has the potential to recover from the loss. Such news to a retiree, however, can be crushing.",3,1058,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01058
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Scams have become a major crime issue in Singapore, warranting the Police to issue separate scam updates in their annual crime reporting since last year. Sir, I, therefore, support the rationale for the CMA and CDSA (Amendment) Bills. These Bills tighten the net around those who facilitate money laundering, including letting their bank accounts and Singpass accounts be used for fund transfers.",4,1059,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01059
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Reducing the opportunities for syndicates to redirect the fruits of crime is a step in the right direction. As to how effective these provisions will be to disrupt the operations of criminal syndicates, only time will tell.",5,1060,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01060
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"That said, I have three clarifications and concerns about the CDSA (Amendment) Bill.",6,1061,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01061
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, on the difficulties of prosecuting money mules currently. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) press release of 18 April 2023, a large number of money mules arrested by Police could not be prosecuted due to difficulties in proving their intent to facilitate criminal activities. It was highlighted that between 2020 and 2022, more than 19,000 money mules were investigated but fewer than 250 cases were eventually prosecuted. I believe the Second Minister stated these statistics earlier as well.",7,1062,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01062
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),This works out to a prosecution rate of just 1.3%. Could MHA clarify whether the balance 98.7% of cases were all not prosecuted due to the difficulties in proving intention or does this number include non-prosecutions due to other grounds as well?,8,1063,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01063
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, on the likely effect of the proposed amendments to reduce the mental element required to prosecute money mules. Clauses 3 to 6 of the CDSA Bill will amend sections 50, 51, 53 and 54 to criminalise acts of money laundering done unintentionally or unknowingly, if rashness or negligence can be shown. The punishment for such acts of rashness or negligence will be lower than for acts done deliberately or with knowledge.",9,1064,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01064
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Coming back to the earlier statistic of not being able to prosecute more than 98% of money mules investigated in the last three years, what is MHA's assessment of how these changes will improve prosecution rates in future?",10,1065,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01065
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, on the new CDSA offence of assisting another person to retain the proceeds of crime under the proposed section 55A. It is stated in the explanatory statement to the Bill that the new section 55A is meant to criminalise certain acts that facilitate money laundering ""regardless of a person's mental state"". My concern here is about persons who may be manipulated into letting others use their bank accounts to transfer money.",11,1066,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01066
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I encountered one resident recently who told me that her bank account had been frozen by Police as it had apparently been used to make or receive some suspicious funds. I tried asking her how her account got compromised, but she was unable to answer coherently. She appeared, to me at least, to be a person who was easily confused and cognitively impaired, and may have been made use of.",12,1067,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01067
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I note that the proposed section 55A(3) and (4) provide a defence to a charge under section 55A if the person did not know or had no reasonable grounds to believe that the funds concerned were the proceeds of crime. Under the law then, a suspected money mule is expected to make some sort of reasoned assessment about the nature of the transaction. How will the authorities approach a case where the suspect appears to be mentally impaired?",13,1068,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01068
2023-05-08-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, while we certainly want to curtail scams and money laundering, we also need to be fair to suspects who may also be victims themselves.",14,1069,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01069

2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to join in this debate. The current situation is very concerning on several counts. Firstly, the increased number of persons being scammed to release their Singpass and/or personal banking credentials and the value involved give cause for grave concern.",1,1071,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01071
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Secondly, that Singaporeans are becoming money mules who knowingly participate in the criminal activities involving their Singpass and/or personal banking credentials is even more concerning as it points to potential waning of Singapore's high integrity value system. Maybe I am watching too many Mediacorp programmes, but are we seeing the return of triads, only this time, triads in digital skin?",2,1072,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01072
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"So, with the amendments to the CDSA and CMA Bills, it will give the appropriate power to the authorities to take action and I hope will also deter persons who think this is easy money to recognise the severity of their actions.",3,1073,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01073
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"At the same time, we do not want Singaporeans to lose confidence in moving to digital. Digital is here to stay and, in fact, will accelerate and become more pervasive in our lives. So, it becomes even more important for Singaporeans to be digital first, even if not digital only. The Minister has assured us in previous speeches that, for Singapore, we are definitely going to take care of those who are less digitally savvy but it does not mean that we are going to go back to the old ages of totally non-digital just because we have such situations going on.",4,1074,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01074

2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),(a) What are the challenges envisaged by the Ministry with regard to enforcement of the law and how does the Ministry intend to address those challenges?,6,1076,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01076
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"(b) There has been a lot of efforts in driving awareness of importance and responsibility of protecting one's digital identity and digital footprint across the board, from banking access to social media and so on. What else is the Government planning to do to increase the effectiveness of these initiatives and what else needs to be done by the banks, financial services institutions, the community and the rest of Government?",7,1077,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01077
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"(c) Is the Government considering additional levels of authentication, for example, using biometrics identification, AI-generated questions, to authenticate that the individual using the identification is really who they say they are? It is probably no longer secure enough to use a login with simply a password and a one-time password (OTP). All this, of course, leads to more costs being involved and more steps. But it looks to me that this may be required. So, how is the Government planning to fight this kind of crime?",8,1078,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01078
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"(d) As this inevitably always involves the banks, the proposed set-up of COSMIC, the FI-to-FI information sharing services platform, which will be debated under the amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill will, I believe, be pertinent because everything flows through the banking system. In lieu of COSMIC going online, what data will the Government use to strengthen enforcement of this Bill?",9,1079,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01079
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"(e) Enforcement of Computer Misuse legislation can be challenging due to several factors, including the rapidly evolving technology. So, how is Singapore planning to keep pace with new forms of cybercrime and methods of committing offences and enable MHA to be able to identify and prosecute perpetrators and the syndicates involved?",10,1080,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01080
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"(f) With the Internet enabling global communication and transactions as we have seen in past cases, cybercrimes often occur across multiple jurisdictions, making it challenging to identify and prosecute offenders. How does MHA involve INTERPOL and their overseas counterparts to ensure that the Bill can be enforced effectively?",11,1081,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01081
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"(g) Most important are the poor victims. The victims need to be protected as much as possible and, where possible, the victims are supported as much as possible with recovering the monies that have been scammed. What else beyond the initiatives already in place will the Government be planning to put into action that can help the victims recover as much of the monies that have been scammed? And perhaps a little bit of compassion from the banks would help, because, in fact, in 2021, a very good friend of mine had somebody, her friend who was totally scammed and then the bank locked down all her bank accounts and she was left borrowing money from other friends. So, certainly, we hope that we need to have a little bit of compassion for the victims and ensure that there is a systematic approach to helping them and supporting them. But, of course, the most important help is to tell them not to give away their identity.",12,1082,2023-05-08-T-024-S-01082
2023-05-08-T-024,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"So, in conclusion, to overcome these challenges, MHA and Anti-Scam Centre Singapore as well as CSA need to work closely with technology experts, cybersecurity professionals and other stakeholders like the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the banks as well as international communities to stay abreast of emerging threats and develop effective strategies for preventing and prosecuting computer misuse crimes. This will involve investing in new technology, enhancing international cooperation and improving training and resources for all personnel involved.

2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"However, while there is a library in the Parliament and the librarians are very helpful, there is no other research support. In place of that, elected MPs are provided a monthly allowance of $1,300 to hire a Legislative Assistant and $500 for a Secretarial Assistant to assist them. I am sure most Members would agree with me that this is meagre and is completely insufficient to hire even one full-time assistant. Obviously, the Government only wants MPs to be supported by volunteers.",9,1101,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01101
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Furthermore, after 1997, only elected MPs are provided an allowance for the purpose of hiring a Legislative Assistant and Secretarial Assistant to support them. The Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs) and Nominated MPs (NMPs) do not receive such an allowance.",10,1102,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01102
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Then Leader of the House, Mr Wong Kan Seng’s justification for the removal of the NCMPs’ support allowances were that the duties of NCMPs were not as heavy and onerous as those of elected MPs, as only elected MPs sit on committees. Today, NCMPs have full voting rights equal to elected MPs and sit on Parliamentary committees. I sit on the Public Petitions Committee and the Parliamentary workload has increased across the board, commensurate with the increasing complexity of our Civil Service and our Parliamentary system.",11,1103,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01103
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The second observation  MPs could contribute more meaningfully to debates if the Government provides Ministerial Statements and other speeches to MPs and MPs provide Ministers with drafts of their speeches beforehand. This would be a win-win situation for all as it enables MPs and Ministers to debate on the substantive issues and further the discussion, instead of having to divine whether the questions have been answered by the Ministerial Statement.",12,1104,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01104
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The ultimate objective of the debates in this Parliament are to arrive at the best policy for Singaporeans, not to win a Parliamentary debate. In that spirit, I have provided this Adjournment Motion speech to the Speaker and the Leader of the House prior to today’s delivery. I hope this has enabled the Government to prepare a more substantive response to the issues and suggestions that I have raised in this speech.",13,1105,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01105
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The third observation  MPs could benefit from more flexibility around time-keeping, especially when it comes to Question Time or the Committee of Supply (COS) debates.",14,1106,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01106
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Time-keeping may be important to keep our processes efficient but I think more Parliamentary time should be provided to ensure that every Member who wants to ask a question can do so. This is especially true during the COS, where many Members have been unable to ask supplementary questions because of the guillotine time and billions of dollars of expenditure are just approved like that.",15,1107,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01107
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),Having more substantive debates on policy would go a long way to enable Singaporeans to become better-informed on public policy and make the Government more accountable.,16,1108,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01108
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Flowing from my observations above, I have several suggestions for improvement, which fall into three major groups. The first group is aimed at better supporting MPs in carrying out their legislative duties.",17,1109,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01109
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One, the Parliament Secretariat should be given resources to set up a research department. This department should have a Head and several full-time staffers to provide research support for MPs as they scrutinise Bills and policies. I think an appropriate annual starting budget for such a department is around $1 million.",18,1110,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01110
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Two, the allowance to hire Legislative Assistants and Secretarial Assistants should be increased and extended to NCMPs and NMPs. It is timely for the Government to review the Legislative Assistant scheme for NCMPs and NMPs, as it had promised to do so in 1997.",19,1111,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01111
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Three, the Government is to provide all data requested by Members in the requested format unless there are national security or financial market sensitivity considerations. The Government should not use the risk of such data being misinterpreted or being used for other purposes as justification for not releasing it. Once again, a fair arena for all.",20,1112,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01112
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The second group of suggestions is aimed at providing MPs with more time to question the Government and to discharge their duties as legislators.,21,1113,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01113
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One, we should introduce an “Opposition hour” during the first day of every Parliamentary Sitting to discuss subjects chosen by the Opposition. These are likely to cover current topics which have the most public interest. This is not new and is done in other Westminster parliaments, such as the UK and Canada. For example, in the UK, the Leader of the Opposition has 17 days where he can select the topics for debate. These debates cover a wide range of issues, from government policy to current events. This also provides a platform for the Opposition to hold the Government to account, challenge its policies and decisions and propose alternative policies or solutions to issues facing the country.",22,1114,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01114
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Two, in principle, the question and answer, and clarification time for all debates, including Parliamentary Questions (PQs), Ministerial Statements, Bills and Motions in this House should not end as long as there are new substantive questions from MPs. This would allow for debates to conclude substantively. The Speaker, obviously, would still have the discretion to end the debate if he is of the view that further questions being asked by MPs are not covering new substantive ground.",23,1115,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01115
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The third group of recommendations is aimed at strengthening the role of the Opposition in our Parliamentary system.,24,1116,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01116
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) should be chaired by an Opposition Member, with Members from all political parties represented on the Committee. The PAC's role is to scrutinise the Government's financial performance and use of public funds. As such, it is important that the PAC is seen as independent and impartial. Many Westminster parliaments ensure this by having an Opposition MP chairing the PAC.",25,1117,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01117
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"This was also the case in Singapore until 1968 when there were no more Opposition MPs in Parliament. The first PAC Chairman under a People's Action Party (PAP) Government in 1959 was AP Rajah, who was an Independent. The second was Mr Lim Huan Boon, who was from the Barisan Sosialis. As it has been over 40 years since Opposition MPs returned to this House, I believe it is timely to again embrace our Parliamentary convention of having an Opposition Member chairing the PAC.",26,1118,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01118
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Two, the Public Petitions Committee (PPC) should also be chaired by an Opposition Member. The PPC plays an important role in providing a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and grievances to the Government. It is, therefore, crucial that the PPC is seen as objective and non-partisan, and having an Opposition Member as a chairperson can help to ensure this. In the UK, there is no rule that the Petitions Committee must be chaired by an Opposition Member, but this is currently the case.",27,1119,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01119
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"In conclusion, Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has, on many occasions, emphasised that the small number of Opposition MPs is far from the one-third necessary to check the PAP's Parliamentary supermajority. What we are asking for is a fair arena for all and access to data and resources.",28,1120,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01120
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The Opposition lacks access to the resources of our excellent Civil Service. Handicapped by this lack of resources, alternative policies created by the Opposition will not have the same breadth and depth of the Government's. The PSP echoes the views of the Leader of the Opposition.",29,1121,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01121
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),I have made many suggestions that will enable us to better discharge our duties as Opposition MPs and NCMPs to Singaporeans. I urge the Government to seriously consider these suggestions.,30,1122,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01122
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The Government must pay more attention to discussing serious alternative policies with us and spend less time deflecting and avoiding uncomfortable questions. On our part, we will continue to do our best to discharge our duties as a rational and responsible Opposition party in Parliament.",31,1123,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01123
2023-05-08-T-026,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"This House comprises both the Government and the Opposition.

2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his speech and suggestions. I also thank him for providing his speech in advance, a departure from his norm in respect of his more recent Adjournment Motions and Motions, but quite understandable, given his proposal, and well appreciated.",1,1126,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01126
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Leong has put forward four proposals. First, to provide additional resources for MPs, NCMPs and NMPs; second, to provide Ministerial speeches in advance and opportunities for Opposition to raise matters; third, more flexibility in time keeping; and fourth, chairmanship of certain Select Committees.",2,1127,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01127
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),Let me address each of these in turn.,3,1128,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01128
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First, on the issue of resources for Members, this is something that we review from time to time. On this, there are two separate points, namely, the difference between the allowances for elected MPs and NCMPs and NMPs; and the quantum of the allowances for hiring Legislative and Secretarial Assistants.",4,1129,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01129
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"On the first point, NCMPs have the same voting rights as MPs in Parliament, but it is indisputable that their workload is less than that of elected MPs, as they do not have the responsibility for a specific constituency or for dealing with Meet-the-People Session (MPS) cases of residents. As such, in principle, it is reasonable to differentiate between the support the elected MPs and NCMPs receive.",5,1130,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01130
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"On the second, in terms of the allowances given to elected MPs, whether it be the general allowance or the allowances for hiring a Legislative Assistant and a Secretarial Assistant, we do not differentiate between PAP MPs and Opposition MPs. The amount given to elected PAP MPs and the elected Opposition MPs is exactly the same, which is fair. The PAP backbenchers make do with exactly the same allowances as the elected WP MPs, save for the Leader of the Opposition (LO).",6,1131,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01131
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In the case of the LO, having regard to the greater Opposition presence in Parliament after the last General Election and the designation of Mr Singh as ""Leader of the Opposition"" for this Parliament, it was appropriate to allocate more resources to him, given his expanded duties and responsibilities. I also wish to highlight that the LO gets more resources than the PAP backbenchers and the PAP Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) chairpersons. However, this is fair, given his role. This is an example of how we review and adjust according to the circumstances.",7,1132,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01132
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Leong has called for a research department to support all MPs, costing $1 million for a start. His justification is that, and I quote, ""many MPs, from both sides of the House, do not come from a public policy or legal background and may require assistance to do such work"".",8,1133,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01133
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"While many PAP MPs do not come from such backgrounds either, they are not asking for this. They have been able to work within the allowances currently allocated to them. They also often pool their Legislative Assistant allowances to hire full-time Legislative and/or Secretarial Assistants to support two or more MPs. They do not confine themselves to the Legislative Assistant allowance, but often also draw upon their MPs' allowance to top up the sum. It is quite open to Opposition MPs and NCMPs to do the same.",9,1134,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01134
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"What is of note, however, is that the absence of such research facilities has not, in any way, deterred the PSP from asserting its ability to advance policy positions.",10,1135,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01135
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In PSP's 2020 manifesto, they said that the Government's response to the economy was, I quote, ""a patchwork of policy tweaks without addressing the fundamental factors affecting Singaporeans"" and what was needed was ""a paradigm shift"" and to ""look for workable alternative solutions going forward"". They said, and I quote again, ""Progress Singapore Party's manifesto offers a better alternative to the current problems that we are facing as a nation"" and their manifesto refers to various economic, social and political policies.",11,1136,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01136
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Today, though, Mr Leong espouses the view that ""The Opposition lacks access to the resources of our excellent Civil Service.

2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),There is a marked contrast between the statements in PSP's manifesto and Mr Leong's statements in Parliament today.,13,1138,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01138
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We do have an excellent Civil Service. However, Mr Leong's assertion misses the point. The Civil Service works with the elected government of the day. Ultimately, it is the Ministers who decide on the Government's agenda and set the major direction of policies being implemented. These policies are not presented by the Civil Service fully formed, with all the Ministers having to do is simply read out the policy speech in Parliament. Ministers provide political guidance to the Civil Service to deliver results and the Ministers have to take responsibility for the same. If Mr Leong needs more information, he can obtain those through PQs and during COS cuts; and he has done so.",14,1139,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01139
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"At the end of the day, the key to better debate in Parliament lies in understanding the main issues at hand, acknowledging our fundamental realities and constraints and taking not just the easy decisions but also the hard ones. It is not through making unending requests for ever more detailed data, which are then used as an alibi for not offering more constructive ideas or better alternative policies during debates.",15,1140,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01140
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In reality, we actually provide more data than most countries. During the last session of Parliament, more than 7,000 PQs were filed and most answers would have involved the provision of data in some form or another. Mr Leong says the Government must provide data in whatever format MPs want. I ask Mr Leong and Members to bear in mind that data collation, as well as slicing and dicing it in different ways and the need to check the data thereafter, costs time, money and effort. We will lean forward to provide what is reasonable and practicable, but we cannot fulfil every whim. Minister Tan See Leng explained this at an earlier Sitting.",16,1141,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01141
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Next, Mr Leong requests that Ministers provide their speeches to MPs in advance.

2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The reality is that the system is designed such that MPs can always engage and debate the Ministers, irrespective of when the Minister's speech is delivered.",18,1143,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01143
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Budget Statement is delivered at least a week before the Budget debate and COS, so, MPs have ample opportunity to think through their speeches and cuts. Bills are introduced during prior Sittings, except in cases of urgency, which are rare. Hence, in general, MPs have about a month to go through the Bill, which forms the basis of the Minister's Second Reading speech.",19,1144,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01144
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Ministerial Statements are generally of two kinds. First, those with strong public interest, where multiple PQs have been filed and those addressing important matters which have to be dealt with expeditiously and at short notice or are not suitable to be dealt with under other mechanisms. MPs can seek clarifications from the Minister on the Ministerial Statement. Policy speeches delivered outside of Parliament, which are publicly reported, Members would have enough time to go through these and raise issues in Parliament.",20,1145,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01145
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In most of these situations, MPs have more than ample opportunity to engage the Ministers on their speeches through a wide array of mechanisms  PQs, supplementary questions, Motions, Bills, Adjournment Motions, clarifications and COS cuts. In fact, if anything, the advantage is with the MPs, because most of these mechanisms are not time-bound. MPs may deploy these days, weeks, months and sometimes even years after the Minister's speech was delivered, as Mr Leong himself has done, for example, on manpower issues.",21,1146,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01146
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Of course, there may be instances where notice is not possible, for example, when the Minister is responding in the course of an ongoing debate or market-sensitive matters, such as tax announcements. But what is possible is to ensure that there is enough time for MPs to digest what has been said, respond and then have an informed substantive debate. This, the Parliamentary procedure allows.",22,1147,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01147
2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"For this same reason, there is no need to have an ""Opposition hour"". This is because every Sitting is an opportunity for MPs, whether PAP or Opposition, to raise topics of their choice and to hold the Government to account, challenge policies and decisions and propose alternative policies through these mechanisms. They can do this through PQs, moving full Motions for debates, as NMPs are doing at this Sitting, or moving Adjournment Motions, as Mr Leong is doing today. This is already taking place.",23,1148,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01148

And the Parliament which elected him was, in turn, elected by the people, who also decided the proportion of PAP MPs and Opposition MPs. Speaker appoints the Chair of the PAC, an authority conferred on him by Parliament through the Standing Orders, and that is also fair because it gives flexibility to choose an appropriate Chair having regard to the technical content involved.",32,1157,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01157

2023-05-08-T-026,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, the rules afford more than enough opportunity for MPs, Opposition or otherwise, to hold the Government to account, raise queries and debate matters. The real issue is how to do this effectively. The answer lies not in changing the rules, but rather, for MPs to develop the skills of listening, using the existing rules more effectively, to make a contribution to the debate and show that they are deserving of the trust that voters have placed in them.",35,1160,2023-05-08-T-026-S-01160

2023-05-08-T-028,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) whether the limited balloting scheme has reduced the waiting time for Singaporean Muslims to perform the Haj pilgrimage; (b) if so, by how much; and (c) whether this scheme prioritises first-time Haj pilgrim applicants.",1,1167,2023-05-08-T-028-S-01167
2023-05-08-T-028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This year, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) allocates 900 places for Singaporean pilgrims to perform the Haj. The existing Advance Haj Registration System (ARHS) allocates these 900 official Haj quota to pilgrims.",1,1168,2023-05-08-T-028-S-01168
2023-05-08-T-028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, KSA also has the discretion to allocate additional places to each country. In past years, KSA granted additional Haj places to Singapore very close to the departure date of the first batch of pilgrims. Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) officers would then reach out to applicants who were in the queue to fill up these additional Haj places within three working days. During the allocation process, MUIS noted that a significant number of applicants in the queue were not prepared to perform the Haj at such short notice.",2,1169,2023-05-08-T-028-S-01169
2023-05-08-T-028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Learning from this experience, MUIS has developed the Limited Balloting Scheme to allocate the often very large number of additional Haj places within a short period in a fair and transparent manner. Under this scheme, Haj registrants who are able to commit to the Haj pilgrimage even with short notice can submit their application to ballot for a place. The balloting will be done through a computer-generated randomised algorithm. The Limited Balloting Scheme will be implemented when MUIS receives updates on the additional Haj places from KSA for future Haj seasons, where there is a need to allocate a large number of places at very short notice. It will not be applied this year.",3,1170,2023-05-08-T-028-S-01170
2023-05-08-T-028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"With better utilisation of both the official and additional Haj places, we hope to eventually ease the backlog of Haj registrants and thus reduce the overall waiting time for pilgrims to perform the Haj. However, this depends on the official and additional Haj places granted by KSA. Other countries have also adopted balloting as a way to allocate Haj places.",4,1171,2023-05-08-T-028-S-01171
2023-05-08-T-028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Limited Balloting Scheme will only be offered to prospective first-time Haj pilgrims who have been in the AHRS queue for more than five years.

2023-05-08-T-029,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the trend in relation to the number of seniors aged 60 and above who live alone in Singapore; (b) what is the frequency of visits or checks on such seniors (i) under the Ministry’s Eldercare Centre service model, (ii) by Silver Generation Ambassadors or (iii) through other Government initiatives; and (c) whether the Government is monitoring the number of seniors who choose to stay reclusive and unconnected with the community.",1,1173,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01173
2023-05-08-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The number of residents aged 65 and above who live alone in Singapore is rising, from 58,000 in 2018 to 79,000 in 2022. This number is expected to continue to increase as our population ages and average household size decreases.",1,1174,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01174
2023-05-08-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Silver Generation Office under the Agency for Integrated Care identifies seniors with needs or are at-risk, such as those who are living alone or are frailer. Silver Generation Ambassadors will visit them once a year and connect them with the relevant support or services.",2,1175,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01175
2023-05-08-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for seniors identified to require social support, they are referred to the Active Ageing Centres (AACs) which provide a suite of services, including active ageing programmes, referral to care services and health-related initiatives. AAC befrienders reach out to them typically at least once a month.",3,1176,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01176
2023-05-08-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Other agencies, such as volunteers from the People’s Association and grassroots organisations or SG Cares Volunteer Centres under the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, will also reach out to seniors who may need assistance and befriending.",4,1177,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01177
2023-05-08-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Indeed, there will be seniors who decline assistance and choose to remain reclusive. Our experience is that if community partners continue to try to build trust and rapport, through check-ins and visits, we can eventually persuade them to take up care and support services when ready.",5,1178,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01178
2023-05-08-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ageing in communities will be a major national initiative under the Forward Singapore exercise. We will step up, expand and deepen our efforts in this area. Details will be announced later in the year when ready.",6,1179,2023-05-08-T-029-S-01179
2023-05-08-T-030,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can provide additional dedicated resources and funding for social service agencies to scale up hiring and training capabilities to support the provision of medical escort services for the elderly from lower-income households who need help to move around and have no caregiver or whose caregiver is unable to provide support because of their own health and physical condition.,1,1180,2023-05-08-T-030-S-01180
2023-05-08-T-030,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health provides funding for Medical Escort and Transport (MET) services which help frail seniors to attend medical appointments if they are unable to do so independently. MET capacity is generally sufficient, though with our ageing population, we will need more in the future.",1,1181,2023-05-08-T-030-S-01181
2023-05-08-T-030,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, the Government provides grants to community care organisations, social service agencies and professionals, such as the Community Silver Trust and the Professional Capability Grant, for capability building. Providers can also tap on manpower recruitment and training initiatives under the Agency for Integrated Care. These include courses relating to safe management of seniors with mobility needs.",2,1182,2023-05-08-T-030-S-01182
2023-05-08-T-031,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,"asked the Minister for Education what are the options available for students who require long-term in-patient care for physical or mental health issues to continue with their schooling and education, even as they are residing in hospitals or other healthcare institutions.",1,1183,2023-05-08-T-031-S-01183
2023-05-08-T-031,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Students who require long-term care for physical or mental health issues vary in terms of the support they need.,1,1184,2023-05-08-T-031-S-01184
2023-05-08-T-031,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Schools work with the families of these students and healthcare professionals to support them where appropriate and transit them back to school when they are ready. For example, teachers and peers may keep in touch with these students through voice or video calls. Schools may facilitate access to learning resources and provide support for learning and socio-emotional well-being to ease their transition back to school when ready.",2,1185,2023-05-08-T-031-S-01185
2023-05-08-T-031,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) also works with schools to provide support for these students if they are sitting for the national examinations. If the students are assessed to be medically fit but are unable to take the papers in an examination venue, SEAB can arrange for these students to sit for their papers in the hospital. If their physical conditions require additional arrangements, such as extra time, these students can apply for appropriate Access Arrangements through their schools.",3,1186,2023-05-08-T-031-S-01186
2023-05-08-T-032,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the remaining issues to be sorted out before the Government will introduce the anti-discrimination law announced by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally in 2021; and (b) when is the draft law expected to be circulated for public review.,1,1187,2023-05-08-T-032-S-01187

2023-05-08-T-034,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"asked the Minister for Health in view of the high cost of MRI scans, whether the Ministry will consider providing additional annual subsidies on top of the existing $300 MediSave funding for outpatient MRI scans, specifically for retired or low-income citizens.",1,1195,2023-05-08-T-034-S-01195
2023-05-08-T-034,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are needed for diagnosing conditions, such as tumours and inflammation. The more common MRI scans cost around $1,000 per scan.",1,1196,2023-05-08-T-034-S-01196
2023-05-08-T-034,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To make scans more affordable, the Ministry of Health (MOH) provides means-tested subsidies of up to 70% to patients at public Specialist Outpatient Clinics. Pioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors get additional subsidies covering 50% or 25% off their remaining bill respectively.",2,1197,2023-05-08-T-034-S-01197
2023-05-08-T-034,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In addition to subsidies, patients can offset their remaining bill by tapping on their MediSave for up to $300 per year for outpatient diagnostic scans, including MRI scans. Seniors aged 60 and above can withdraw an additional $300 per year from MediSave for MRI scans under the Flexi-MediSave scheme. Taken together, Pioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors would likely incur low, if not, zero out-of-pocket payments at public Specialist Outpatient Clinics.",3,1198,2023-05-08-T-034-S-01198

2023-05-08-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The mode and format of assessment depend on the purpose of the assessment and the learning outcomes to be assessed.

2023-05-08-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"National examinations like the ""A"" levels are designed to elicit evidence of students’ attainment of learning outcomes for various subjects at the end of study.

2023-05-08-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It is important to approach national assessment with the right mindset, without which, unhealthy stress will come with any examination format – be it continuous, cumulative or episodic.

It refers to the network of relations in a community and the set of values animating that community, which allows all the individuals in that community to work together effectively to achieve a common purpose.

An organisation with such a far-reaching and far-ranging mission is always a work-in-progress. But I think it has succeeded in its mission substantially – and there is no better proof of that than in how Singaporeans came together during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of the grassroots leaders have served since PA’s early founding years and have established a deep familiarity and rapport with the residents that cannot be replicated by civil servants in other Government agencies. An agency, one of whose roles is to establish people-to-people links, cannot be relying solely on civil servants to nurture these networks of relations that so enrich our communities.",6,1260,2023-05-08-T-047-S-01260

Those without smartphones or who needed a bit more help could simply drop by a Community Centre, be it Joo Chiat or Hougang, to get assistance from PA staff.

For example, during the COVID-19 period, PA worked with the Ministry of Health to raise awareness, explain and assist in the implementation of the vaccination programme.

2023-05-08-T-056,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As explained in previous Parliamentary replies, from a road safety perspective, it would be ideal for lorries not to carry any passengers in their rear decks. However, there are significant practical and operational considerations. This is why practices are varied internationally.

The Committee engages and works closely with the key stakeholders, including lorry suppliers and companies, especially small and medium enterprises, to study measures to enhance safety for their workers. This is a continuing effort which the Government has undertaken over the years, taking into consideration the latest developments.

The average monthly income of the 27,000 home owners who refinanced their loans had increased by about 10% over the last three years. This would have helped cushion the increase in their mortgage payments.",2,1307,2023-05-08-T-057-S-01307
2023-05-08-T-057,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Most borrowers have been generally prudent and, hence, are able to cope with the rise in mortgage payments.

It is chargeable on the value of supply, whether the consideration received is monetary or non-monetary. Where a discount is given on a supply, GST is generally chargeable on the discounted price. However, if the discount is granted on the condition that the customer meets certain obligations imposed, which results in tangible goods or services being provided to the seller, this is a form of non-monetary consideration paid for the supply. For example, a seller may supply goods to a buyer at a discount from the retail price in exchange for the buyer’s provision of advertising or marketing services to the seller. In such instances, GST should be charged on the full retail price.",1,1351,2023-05-08-T-068-S-01351

2023-05-08-T-086,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Under the Resource Sustainability Act, producers of packaged products, as well as retailers, such as supermarkets, with an annual turnover of more than $10 million are required to report their annual packaging use and their plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging to the National Environment Agency (NEA). This raises companies’ awareness of the amount of packaging materials consumed, including plastic packaging, and the potential to reduce waste. It also lays the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for packaging waste eventually.",1,1417,2023-05-08-T-086-S-01417

2023-05-08-T-089,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Although there have been similar studies in other countries, such as Greece and the United States of America, on reducing contamination, it is not feasible to make a fair comparison. Different countries have different waste collection methodologies and control measures. Hence, solutions that work overseas may not be applicable to our local context.",2,1429,2023-05-08-T-089-S-01429
2023-05-08-T-089,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have implemented and are working on various initiatives to recover cleaner waste streams to raise recycling rates and reduce contamination rates.

2023-05-08-T-090,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The requirement for food handlers to wear a mask or spit guard has been in place since April 2020. Following the easing of national COVID-19 mask-wearing requirements in August 2022, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has conducted multiple industry engagements and issued repeated advisories through media statements and posters to remind food establishment operators of this food safety requirement and to raise public awareness. SFA’s publicity on enforcement action serves as further reminders to licensees on their responsibilities.",1,1432,2023-05-08-T-090-S-01432

2023-05-08-T-091,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We assure the Member that harassment of staff by parents or students is not common. Nevertheless, in our schools and IHLs, there are clear policies to manage any incidents of harassment, including escalation procedures and measures to protect our educators and staff and send a strong message that such behaviour is unacceptable. In extreme situations where staff feel harassed or their safety is threatened, measures include calling the Police for assistance and using legal levers, such as the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA), to protect staff from further harassment. Under POHA, where the victim of harassment is a public servant or a public service worker who was performing his or her duty, the offender is liable for enhanced penalties of an imprisonment term of up to 12 months, compared to six months for other victims, a fine of up to $5,000, or both. In addition, there are support structures, such as counselling, to provide support and care for our staff affected by harassment.",2,1436,2023-05-08-T-091-S-01436

2023-05-08-T-095,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Ministry of Education (MOE) is committed to supporting all students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) in quality educational settings that best meet their needs. As of December 2022, there were about 35,500 students with reported SEN. Of these, 80% were supported in mainstream schools. The remaining 20% have moderate to severe SEN and, therefore, were supported in Government-funded Special Education (SPED) schools.

2023-05-08-T-102,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Since 2005, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) coffee shop operators are required under their tenancy agreements to have at least one halal stall. Should the halal stall operator cease operations, the coffee shop operator is required to find a replacement within the current tenancy period. It is in the interest of the operator to find a replacement as soon as possible, to minimise loss of revenue arising from the vacant stall.",1,1478,2023-05-08-T-102-S-01478
2023-05-08-T-102,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If the operator fails to find a replacement, HDB may decide not to renew the tenancy or, as a last resort, terminate the tenancy. However, before taking such action, HDB will discuss and work with existing operators to resolve the issue or to allow operators more time to adjust or find a replacement.",2,1479,2023-05-08-T-102-S-01479
2023-05-08-T-102,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Stricter penalties, as suggested by the Member’s question, might not be the best strategy for bringing about the desired outcome of halal food availability. The Ministry of National Development and HDB are concerned about residents’ needs and have also been listening to the feedback of coffee shop operators. Some have found it difficult to secure replacement stalls due to lower demand in certain areas or strong competition from other options nearby.",3,1480,2023-05-08-T-102-S-01480
2023-05-08-T-102,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Hence, we are prepared to consider alternative approaches. We will engage the industry for feedback and work with them to co-create solutions for maintaining good availability of halal cooked food in HDB coffee shops.",4,1481,2023-05-08-T-102-S-01481
2023-05-08-T-103,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry has data for each of the last 10 years on (i) the number of appeals that were made to the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (SISV) to review the valuation conducted by a valuer for an HDB flat and (ii) the number of SISV appeals that resulted in a revaluation of such HDB flats.,1,1482,2023-05-08-T-103-S-01482

2023-05-08-T-106,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether he can (i) elaborate on the cross-agency collaboration efforts that will be implemented to address noise issues between neighbours and (ii) provide details on the criteria that will be used to determine whether such a noise dispute is classified as ""serious"" and necessitates the intervention of the dedicated unit that was recently announced during the Ministry’s Committee of Supply debate.",1,1492,2023-05-08-T-106-S-01492
2023-05-08-T-106,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF) promotes neighbourliness and encourages residents to engage with one another in the first instance when disputes arise. As much as possible, it is best that disputes are resolved amicably at an early stage, before they become intransigent or intractable. Residents can also seek help from grassroots leaders to facilitate communications or attempt formal mediation at the Community Mediation Centre with a trained mediator.",1,1493,2023-05-08-T-106-S-01493
2023-05-08-T-106,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have previously announced the enhancements at this year’s Committee of Supply.

2023-05-08-T-106,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The majority of community disputes involve neighbourhood noise. These are often complex and subjective issues for which the setting of clearer social norms plays a pivotal role. The Community Advisory Panel on Neighbourhood Noise (CAP) has established a set of community norms to manage noise and foster harmonious living, including an understanding of what kinds of noise are acceptable or unacceptable in the residential setting. Since receiving CAP’s recommendations, the Municipal Services Office (MSO) has been working with partners to promote the proposed community norms and engaging relevant stakeholders on the proposed recommendations.",3,1495,2023-05-08-T-106-S-01495
2023-05-08-T-106,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Whilst a substantial majority of neighbourhood noise feedback occurs in the Housing and Development Board estates today, private estate residents can also avail themselves of various features of the proposed CDMF, such as mandatory mediation and an enhanced CDRT framework, in the appropriate cases. We will also consider the extent to which any other enhancements to the framework can eventually also benefit residents in private estates, with adjustments as may be appropriate. We should add that CDMF should not take away from the community’s capacity to resolve disputes. Hence, the new pilot unit leveraging stronger laws will focus mainly on intervening in serious disputes. What qualifies as serious will be considered on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the context and circumstances in which the dispute has arisen.",4,1496,2023-05-08-T-106-S-01496

2023-05-08-T-108,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The Shortage Occupation List (SOL) is designed to complement efforts to develop the pipeline of local professionals. Enabling companies to access foreign professionals for shortage occupations allows these companies to grow their business and create new opportunities. Part of the criteria before an occupation is placed on the SOL is not just whether there is a shortage of such local workers, but also what plans there are by the industry and companies to train and place locals into these jobs.",1,1502,2023-05-08-T-108-S-01502
2023-05-08-T-108,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"As these occupations are facing shortages, salaries are competitive and will not depress wages for Singaporeans. In any case, foreign professionals filling SOL occupations will still need to meet the prevailing Employment Pass (EP) qualifying salary. The EP qualifying salary is benchmarked against the top one-third of local professionals, managers, executives and technicians.",2,1503,2023-05-08-T-108-S-01503
2023-05-08-T-108,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,SOL will be reviewed every three years. Occupations will be re-assessed based on whether the occupation remains in shortage at that point in time and whether commitments to develop the local pipeline have been achieved.,3,1504,2023-05-08-T-108-S-01504

However, based on MOM’s ad hoc interviews with migrant workers conducted in 2019, they typically incur S$2,000 to S$10,000 in fees to work in Singapore. This depends on factors, such as the economic conditions and the extent of intermediary involvement in the recruitment process in their home countries.",1,1506,2023-05-08-T-109-S-01506

The guidelines aim to make requesting for FWAs a workplace norm, by requiring employers to put in place proper processes to fairly consider and respond to employees’ requests for FWAs. We will also continue to support employers with training and tools to implement FWAs effectively and sustainably.

This represents around 47% of all jobseekers placed by WSG and NTUC’s e2i, similar to the share of women in the labour force.
