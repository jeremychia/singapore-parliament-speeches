2023-05-10-T-001-S-00001,2023-05-10-T-001,1,Deputy Speaker,Leader of the House.
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00002,2023-05-10-T-001,2,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, every time a Member speaks in this Chamber, three other voices speak too – that of our translators, simultaneously translating our speeches into the other official languages. Today, one of those voices is silent. Last week Members were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of our Tamil translator, Mr Palaniappan s/o Arumugum, on 4 May 2023."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00003,2023-05-10-T-001,3,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Palaniappan, known to many of us affectionately as Mr Pala, worked at Parliament for more than 30 years and as such, was a familiar figure to many cohorts of Members of Parliament (MPs). With your leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, I like to say something on behalf of all Members to remember Mr Palaniappan and acknowledge his contributions."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00004,2023-05-10-T-001,4,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please do."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00005,2023-05-10-T-001,5,Indranee Rajah,I should also mention that we have with us in the Gallery Mr Palaniappan’s family. [
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00006,2023-05-10-T-001,6,Indranee Rajah,"They are seated in front of the window on the far right, where you see some flowers placed. That used to be Mr Palaniappan's seat in Parliament, where he did his translation. We extend to the family our deepest condolences. I had invited them to be with us as we remember him and I hope that they will take comfort from the knowledge that Mr Palaniappan’s life and work is recognised and appreciated by this House."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00007,2023-05-10-T-001,7,Indranee Rajah,"Many of us have only ever known Mr Palaniappan in his role as a translator and interpreter in Parliament. However, this was only part of the rich tapestry of his life and service, and it is fitting that I recount some of this, to give Members and the public a better sense of this unassuming but remarkable man."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00008,2023-05-10-T-001,8,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Palaniappan, commenced his 50-year career in the Public Service in 1968 as a Judiciary Interpreter at the State Courts where he was in service till 1990, with a two-year hiatus from 1981 to 1983 when he was with the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporation."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00009,2023-05-10-T-001,9,Indranee Rajah,Mr Pala then joined Parliament Secretariat in September 1990 and retired upon reaching the compulsory retirement age in January 2012. He was re-employed by the Parliament Secretariat till July 2020 and worked part-time to interpret parliamentary proceedings during Sittings till November 2022.
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00010,2023-05-10-T-001,10,Indranee Rajah,"His voice was most often heard translating the Parliament proceedings from English to Tamil and, occasionally, from Tamil to English when speeches were made in Tamil. During his 30-year tenure in Parliament Secretariat, Mr Pala made many important contributions."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00011,2023-05-10-T-001,11,Indranee Rajah,"He led the Language Services Department, from 2008 until his retirement in 2012, during which he instituted several measures to improve simultaneous interpretation services during Parliamentary Sittings."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00012,2023-05-10-T-001,12,Indranee Rajah,"In addition, Mr Pala helped promote inter-parliamentary relations by managing incoming and outgoing Parliamentary visits and conferences, taking up the role of Chief Liaison Officer for many parliamentary conferences hosted by the Singapore Parliament. Many a time, he went beyond official duties to ensure the foreign dignitaries were well taken care of, and received numerous oral and written compliments."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00013,2023-05-10-T-001,13,Indranee Rajah,"He served a total of five Speakers of Parliament – namely Mr Tan Soo Khoon, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, Mr Michael Palmer, Mdm Halimah Yacob and our current Speaker, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin – and accompanied them and many Members on countless official Parliamentary trips."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00014,2023-05-10-T-001,14,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Pala’s vast experience and expertise in interpretation and translation between Tamil and English, was highly valued at the national level."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00015,2023-05-10-T-001,15,Indranee Rajah,"He was part of the regular interpretation team for the National Day Rallies and was appointed by the Government as a member of the National Standardisation Committee for Tamil Media from 2009 to 2013, and the National Translation Committee (NTC), serving as the NTC’s Tamil Resource Panel Chairman from 2014 to 2020. During his tenure, he improved the standards of Tamil translation within the Public Service."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00016,2023-05-10-T-001,16,Indranee Rajah,Mr Pala served in the Tamil Language Council as a volunteer for close to 15 years and was instrumental in developing a Bilingual Glossary (English – Tamil) for the public as well as an e-Glossary for students. The key feature of this Glossary was the compilation of more than a few hundred words that are unique to the Singaporean Tamil context. It is still in use today.
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00017,2023-05-10-T-001,17,Indranee Rajah,"He actively contributed to the building of Tamil vocabulary by starting a Facebook page called “Singai Translate Community”, which deliberated with members of the general public on how best to translate complex English words and subject matters into the Tamil language."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00018,2023-05-10-T-001,18,Indranee Rajah,"In 2014, Mr Pala translated the biography of our former President Mr SR Nathan titled ""An Unexpected Journey  Path to the Presidency"", into Tamil."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00019,2023-05-10-T-001,19,Indranee Rajah,"After retiring, Mr Pala continued to impart his wealth of knowledge and experience as an Adjunct Faculty at the National Institute of Education and an Associate Faculty at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, where he had taught courses on Tamil Culture, Translation and Interpretation."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00020,2023-05-10-T-001,20,Indranee Rajah,"In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the Efficiency, Public Service, Long Service and Commendation Medals in 1996, 2001, 2008 and 2011 respectively."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00021,2023-05-10-T-001,21,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Pala also made many contributions in the community, serving and receiving the Public Service Medal in 2001 as Vice-Chairman, Telok Blangah Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC). A respected community and grassroots leader, he played a significant role in grassroots events, solemnised marriages in English and Tamil where he made it a point to brief the couple on family values, and translated speeches for national agencies."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00022,2023-05-10-T-001,22,Indranee Rajah,"In the 1980s he served as the secretary of the Hindu Endowments Board. Subsequently, he served on the Management Committee of the Sri Krishnan Temple and furthered racial harmony through his participation in the Inter-racial Religious Circles (IRCC). He emceed and helped out at temple consecration ceremonies and functions."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00023,2023-05-10-T-001,23,Indranee Rajah,"But beyond these official duties, there was Mr Pala the man. Gentle, unassuming and approachable, Mr Pala would quickly put people at ease. I recall how, when I was first appointed Deputy Speaker many years ago, he made an effort to make me feel welcome and offered assistance should I need it. He was always ready to give counsel and help to those who needed it. Warm, witty and friendly, he had a cheeky and playful streak which endeared him to many who encountered him, and he was always good company. He was a good father and a good role model."
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00024,2023-05-10-T-001,24,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, we have lost a good friend and a good man. However, we have been enriched by his contributions the impact of which still remain. He may no longer be with us but his voice can still be heard in the works he translated and in the Tamil language that he loved so dearly and did so much to promote. Mr Palaniappan was a Singaporean that we all can be proud of. May he rest in peace. [Applause.]"
2023-05-10-T-001-S-00025,2023-05-10-T-001,25,Deputy Speaker,"Thank you very much, Leader. Thank you to the family for being present."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00026,2023-05-10-T-002,26,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health with the Ministry’s shift to the capitation model in financing public healthcare clusters, where each cluster gets a fixed sum of money per person living in an area within the cluster (a) whether this will result in longer waiting times for patients to receive treatments in our hospitals; (b) how will the Ministry ensure that service quality to patients is not compromised; and (c) what are the benchmarks and performances standards set out for service quality under this model."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00027,2023-05-10-T-002,27,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health with the shift towards the capitation model in financing public healthcare clusters, where each cluster gets a fixed sum of money per person living in an area within the cluster, whether the Ministry can update on its pilots of using other models to finance the clusters such as the pay-for-performance, which rewards good performance in key priority areas, and bundled payments, where funding is based on a patient's entire care episode."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00028,2023-05-10-T-002,28,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 1 and 2 raised by Mr Yip Hon Weng together?"
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00029,2023-05-10-T-002,29,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please proceed."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00030,2023-05-10-T-002,30,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, my response will also cover the matters raised in the separate question filed by Ms Ng Ling Ling"
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00031,2023-05-10-T-002,31,Janil Puthucheary,"I will first provide some background on the different methods of funding for healthcare institutions. For various reasons – asymmetry of information between doctors and patients, the moral hazard of insurance, the anxiety of patients and their loved ones – healthcare is highly susceptible to funding wastage. Better funding methods can reduce such wastage, without affecting service quality."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00032,2023-05-10-T-002,32,Janil Puthucheary,"For example, funding by workload, such as the number of procedures, surgeries, scans, hospital bed days, does not in itself incentivise hospitals to be more targeted and efficient in delivering healthcare services, because all activities will be funded anyway."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00033,2023-05-10-T-002,33,Janil Puthucheary,"Bundled payments, which are commonly practised around the world, help to remove what are known as disease-level operational inefficiencies. This means that hospitals get funded per care episode, rather than based on a detailed breakdown of workload. We had implemented the bundled payments pilots, which allowed institutions to generate cost savings, for instance, by facilitating earlier transitions from acute hospitals to community hospitals, where appropriate."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00034,2023-05-10-T-002,34,Janil Puthucheary,"As hospitals attend to patients with varying degrees of disease severity, some requiring more interventions than others, so, bundled payment rates are set at an average to cover the total cost of all care episodes. This provides an incentive for the hospital to be more efficient. Another model is pay-for-performance which provides financial incentives for clusters to perform well in key priority areas. Our pilot projects delivered positive results, leading to better health outcomes without compromising care."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00035,2023-05-10-T-002,35,Janil Puthucheary,"However, these mechanisms, such as bundled payments by care episode, do not in themselves incentivise the reduction of what is known as population level wastage, that is, some patients should not become sick in the first place where preventive steps could have been taken in homes or communities to keep the residents healthy, before they become patients."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00036,2023-05-10-T-002,36,Janil Puthucheary,"Capitation funding aims to incentivise healthcare providers to place a greater emphasis on preventive care. Under this funding model, healthcare providers are assigned a population base and are paid a pre-determined amount per resident under their charge. They will thus be encouraged to incur a lower cost by intervening upstream and early to keep the patient healthy, knowing that it will require them to spend more to treat or cure patients in hospitals after they fall sick. This method of funding is commonly practised around the world as well."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00037,2023-05-10-T-002,37,Janil Puthucheary,"Different methods of funding for healthcare, be it bundled payments or capitation, if designed and implemented well, will not negatively affect the quality of service at hospitals. If wastage and unnecessary procedures can be removed, it will improve the effectiveness of our healthcare workers as well as their well-being, it will reduce the financing burden of healthcare and can improve the level of service."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00038,2023-05-10-T-002,38,Janil Puthucheary,"From 1 April 2023, we transited to a capitation funding model for our three healthcare clusters. Each has a population of about 1.5 million residents assigned under them. Each cluster will be paid funding rates based on the age bands of their residents. The rates are designed so that there is no reduction – and in fact a slight increase, to the cluster budgets in previous years. As our population gets older, more residents will require higher capitation rates and the clusters will correspondingly receive higher budgets."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00039,2023-05-10-T-002,39,Janil Puthucheary,We maintain a flexible system where residents can continue to choose which hospitals they would like to go to and need not go to only the hospitals from the cluster that they are assigned to. Transfer payments between clusters will be made to take this into account.
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00040,2023-05-10-T-002,40,Janil Puthucheary,"With capitation funding, the Ministry of Health (MOH) sets priority areas and key indicators for the immediate, medium and long term, while the public healthcare clusters have the mandate and operational flexibility to decide the resource allocation across their institutions and services. These key indicators were outlined in the White Paper on Healthier SG."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00041,2023-05-10-T-002,41,,"Healthcare clusters will take into account various factors when deciding how to allocate their funds. These factors may include the cost of operations incurred by various healthcare institutions under their charge, the mix of residents that they serve and the performance management system under that cluster. It does not mean that cluster have to pass through the funding mechanism in the form of capitation funding to their individual health institutions, which may not be practical. However, with capitation at the cluster level, there is a strong incentive for the clusters to invest more in primary and preventive care, and to work with all community partners, to help their residents stay healthy or delay disease progression. We should expect many more initiatives in the preventive care space in the coming years."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00042,2023-05-10-T-002,42,Deputy Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00043,2023-05-10-T-002,43,Yip Hon Weng,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker and I thank the Senior Minister of State for his responses to my Parliamentary Questions (PQs). I have two supplementary questions to each of the PQs. First, under the capitation model, will there be a system in place to review the exceptional cases where patients outlive their prognosis or if their illness do not follow through the usual trajectory and ensure that care is not denied for these cases."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00044,2023-05-10-T-002,44,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, given the rapid advancement in technology, especially in medical devices and pharmacology, how often are the care protocols reviewed, such that the capitation model and formulas are kept relevant with the most cost-effective treatments available?"
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00045,2023-05-10-T-002,45,Yip Hon Weng,"Third, under the capitation model, will physicians be less incentivised to think out of the box to treat patients with complex clinical conditions as it may require costlier treatments."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00046,2023-05-10-T-002,46,Yip Hon Weng,"And lastly, while it is part of the plan for Healthier SG to stick with one general practitioner (GP), will capitation restrict patient choices for tertiary care as they will now be covered under regional area and served by a particular hospital?"
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00047,2023-05-10-T-002,47,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Mr Yip for his four supplementary questions. The first was whether there would be an issue around exceptional cases that do not follow the usual trajectory for diseases and the short answer is that, this is not a problem. While the rates are set on the basis of a mean because they are covering a large population base, it does take into account the great variance on an individual basis around disease and disease progression where some patients will do very well, short stays, minimal intervention and some will require a lot more, and that has been factored in to the calculations around the funding mechanism. And it does not change the way in which the individual care decisions are made."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00048,2023-05-10-T-002,48,Janil Puthucheary,"Will care protocols be reviewed? Yes. Capitation is a funding mechanism at a large population level. It does not remove the various other governance mechanisms that are in place across our healthcare system from the professional boards, the licensing boards, the interface with research and academia and the clinical review processes. All of these will continue to review care protocols to make sure the care that is delivered is entirely appropriate."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00049,2023-05-10-T-002,49,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Yip also asked if there is less incentive to innovate and think out the box? The answer is no. That the personal level or the individual level of the clinicians will of course continue to be driven by their professional desire to provide the best possible care, whether it is following a standard protocol well demonstrated or whether it is looking for innovative ways to deal with unusual and exceptional circumstances. At the system level, the idea is to put in place mechanisms that drive innovation and thinking to be able to derive efficiencies, but more importantly, better care through the resources that we have."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00050,2023-05-10-T-002,50,Janil Puthucheary,"And as I explained in my main answer, the answer to his last question, it does not restrict the choice of where a resident or a patient can receive their care from. They can access care services from across the three clusters, even if they have been assigned as part of a population base for one cluster, MOH will work with the clusters and the administrative side of the healthcare system to do back-end transfer payments so that the residents do not have to worry about this and they will have that choice of where to receive their healthcare maintained."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00051,2023-05-10-T-002,51,Deputy Speaker,Ms Ng Ling Ling.
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00052,2023-05-10-T-002,52,Ng Ling Ling,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I just have two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. Thank you for the explanation on how capitation grant will be implemented. My first question is that, if capitation is a method of encouraging less wastage and more preventive and primary care, how is MOH monitoring that clusters even with operational flexibility given, is actually channelling more of their resources towards primary and preventive care."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00053,2023-05-10-T-002,53,Ng Ling Ling,"The second question is, towards the health outcomes that the clusters are asked to work towards for the funding, can the Senior Minister of State give an example of how a cluster will be incentivised to shift the capitation funding towards where we are directionally moving, preventive and primary care, rather than what they are doing today, it could be just for volume."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00054,2023-05-10-T-002,54,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Ms Ng for the questions. On the first, how will we know that they are indeed channelling resources to primary and preventive care, well, we work very closely with the clusters on a day-to-day basis, with the clinicians at all levels of our healthcare ecosystem. The healthcare services have to interface with MOH on licensing decisions, on regulatory decisions, on the provision of resources. And so, we will indeed have very close feel of where manpower resources and effort across our healthcare system is being asserted and will then know whether or not these measures around funding and around governance are resulting in the operational changes and the service delivery changes that we are hoping for. And we will pay very close attention to this."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00055,2023-05-10-T-002,55,Janil Puthucheary,"She asked for an example. I am a little hesitant because the whole idea is indeed to incentivise the clinicians and the service delivery teams to be able to think through what works best for their residents and their clinical service teams and their operational model. But a hypothetical example, let us say something like diabetes, if you wanted to institute some particular care around diabetic eye disease, for example, you may choose to do this essentially and through the Eye Centre, through the ophthalmologists; or you may choose to do this on a screening basis and perhaps increase the capability at the level of the polyclinics, in the GPs to be able to detect this early; or you could potentially even go into the community and explain how having good care around your diabetes can prevent eye disease from happening in the first place. And clearly, what we hope would be that the clusters and the professionals would do more of the third and prioritise the third and we should see that type of approach happening. That is an example, I do not know if that is the best example, but I think the examples and the specific clinical initiatives need to come from the professionals and the care teams that are involved."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00056,2023-05-10-T-002,56,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00057,2023-05-10-T-002,57,Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have one question for the Senior Minister of State. Will the capitation payment include all charges that the GP will charge the patient, meaning the capitation payment will include both the consultation and the drug cost of each visit by the patient? Or is a drug cost excluded?"
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00058,2023-05-10-T-002,58,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Mr Leong for his question, but that is not what capitation payment is – which is, capitation is a mechanism to bundle the budget that is allocated at the cluster level and what he is asking about are the charges that are made available at the patient level, and potentially the subsidies associated with those charges and to offset those charges. Those are very, very different issues. When we talk about capitation, it is about how we take the budget that is available for healthcare and decide what are the allocations to each of the clusters, what are the allocations to each of the priority areas or the diseases or the care models, at a big picture level. So, the question that he is asking, in a way does not apply to the issue of capitation funding."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00059,2023-05-10-T-002,59,Deputy Speaker,"A very brief supplementary question, please, Mr Leong, and then we will move on."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00060,2023-05-10-T-002,60,Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can I ask the  Senior Minister of State then,"
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00061,2023-05-10-T-002,61,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Mr Leong for his question. The charging model for individual patients under Healthier SG is not what we are doing with capitation. Capitation is about how we assign our budget to the clusters. What he is asking about is how will patients be charged when they go and see their GP, whether you have a Healthier SG programme or whether you are going for a fee for service. That is not what we are talking about when we mean capitation funding, which is a way of deciding how to assign the MOH budget to the clusters, to hospitals and to different services."
2023-05-10-T-002-S-00062,2023-05-10-T-002,62,Janil Puthucheary,"I appreciate that he may indeed be reflecting the concern of resident citizens about how they are charged, I believe those issues have been discussed at some length and are available in a fairly transparent and documented way at a number of sites, but perhaps today is not the place or the time to debate them."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00063,2023-05-10-T-003,63,Yeo Wan Ling,asked asked the Minister for Transport what is the number of fatalities and injuries from falls onto LRT tracks in the past 10 years.
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00064,2023-05-10-T-003,64,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Sir, there were two fatalities and one injury from falls onto Light Rail Transit (LRT) tracks in the past 10 years."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00065,2023-05-10-T-003,65,Deputy Speaker,Ms Yeo.
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00066,2023-05-10-T-003,66,Yeo Wan Ling,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. As you may know, we had a very tragic incident that occurred at the Punggol Cove LRT station a few weeks ago and our Punggol community is distraught about the loss."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00067,2023-05-10-T-003,67,Yeo Wan Ling,"Since 2018, glass panels have been installed at our LRT platforms, but the gap is left where the door should be. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has told me that there are space and technical constraints on the platform preventing the installation of auto doors. Given that our Punggol LRT stations can be quite crowded during peak hours, especially when children are headed to school, our Punggol residents are very concerned about the safety of commuters, especially children."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00068,2023-05-10-T-003,68,Yeo Wan Ling,"Can the Ministry give an update on whether there has been any technical breakthroughs since 2018 on installing doors at the platform and in the case where this is not yet feasible, what additional safety measures can the Ministry implement to prevent commuters from accidental falling into the LRT tracks?"
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00069,2023-05-10-T-003,69,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for her supplementary question. I note the concerns of the residents and understandably so. Let me say that, in designing and running our rail network, safety is our highest priority. So, as the Member has noted, since 2018, we have installed fixed barriers at all LRT stations. In addition, we have also installed a line of tactile warning studs along the station platform to warn commuters that they are approaching the edge of the platform."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00070,2023-05-10-T-003,70,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition, there are emergency telephones for commuters to communicate with the stationmasters, as well as emergency stop plungers, which allow commuters to stop the trains in the case of emergency. We have also actually increased the signages and announcements in our LRT stations to remind commuters of safety practices within the station as well as signages to warn people, to remind people, to stay behind the yellow lines."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00071,2023-05-10-T-003,71,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We had studied – as the Member said – the feasibility of installing platform screen doors at our LRT stations and as she has noted, for LRT stations they have much smaller space than MRT stations and installing platform screen doors require additional space for power communication, signal control rooms and so on. And it is not possible or it will be difficult to accommodate such facilities in every station without substantially affecting the waiting space. And as she has said, sometimes the platform can be quite crowded, so this actually may not improve the safety of our commuters. Nonetheless, let me assure the Member that we will continue to look into the feasibility of platform screen doors taking into account any new technologies that may come into the market."
2023-05-10-T-003-S-00072,2023-05-10-T-003,72,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Let me also say that as an additional safeguard, our public transport operators are looking into technologies like video analytics to provide early alerts should there be a commuter intrusion onto the tracks to provide us more time to intervene."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00073,2023-05-10-T-004,73,Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the criteria for occupations to be placed on the Non-Traditional Sources (NTS) Occupation List; and (b) how often will the list be reviewed.
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00074,2023-05-10-T-004,74,Tan See Leng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the seven occupations on the Non-Traditional Source (NTS) Occupation List were carefully selected in consultation with sector agencies. We evaluated occupations with a significant number of S Pass holders who may be affected by the upcoming changes in the S Pass framework. We also assessed the number of locals in these occupations as well as the local employment outcomes."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00075,2023-05-10-T-004,75,Tan See Leng,"The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will work closely with sector agencies to engage the industries as well as our tripartite partners to review the list every three years. We are open to reviewing it more regularly, keeping in mind, above all, the need to uplift our lower-wage workers and also to spur industry transformation to become less reliant on lower-skilled foreign workers."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00076,2023-05-10-T-004,76,Deputy Speaker,Mr Sharael Taha.
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00077,2023-05-10-T-004,77,Sharael Taha,"I would like to thank the Minister for his reply. I would like to declare my interests one of the 22,000 employees in the aerospace industry."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00078,2023-05-10-T-004,78,Sharael Taha,"I acknowledge that the NTS occupational list includes occupations across several Industries, including F&B and manufacturing. However, the list does not include support workers in the aerospace industry. The aerospace industry is recovering and ramping up again after three years of very challenging times during the pandemic years. The industry has already focused on automation, lean management and invested heavily in R&D to enhance productivity."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00079,2023-05-10-T-004,79,Sharael Taha,"While the industry has also worked very closely with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and agencies like Workforce Singapore (WSG) to redesign jobs to attract locals to the industry, however, the aerospace industry is still facing difficulties in finding manpower to support its recovery and growth, particularly in supporting roles that complement the value-added jobs that our Singaporean local workforce is already doing."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00080,2023-05-10-T-004,80,Sharael Taha,"While efforts are made to redesign jobs for locals to focus on the value-added roles such as inspectors, lead technicians, technical specialists, there is still a need for more workers in supporting and complementary roles such as machinists, blasting or chemical line operators or fitters."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00081,2023-05-10-T-004,81,Sharael Taha,"Can MOM consider such specific supporting and complementary roles in the aerospace industry to be placed in the NTS occupation list, especially at the time when the industry is trying to recover and grow in a competitive global maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) market amidst a tight labour market?"
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00082,2023-05-10-T-004,82,Tan See Leng,"I thank the hon Member for his feedback. In short, the answer to his suggestion is yes, we will certainly take his feedback back to MOM as well as work with the different sector agencies to consider and to review."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00083,2023-05-10-T-004,83,Tan See Leng,"But I think it is important, as I have mentioned earlier in my response, to note that we will continue to refine the NTS OL framework. And we have to also be mindful in terms of balancing our longer-term objective to spur industry transformation towards productivity-led and manpower-lean growth, so that we can also make sure that we nuance to build a fit local employment outcome as well as the industries' manpower needs."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00084,2023-05-10-T-004,84,Tan See Leng,"For the aerospace industry, it is indeed a growing space and it is also quite sector-specific and also quite specialised. I would request for the Member and encourage the Member to also engage the Economic Development Board (EDB) and EDB would then work with MOM."
2023-05-10-T-004-S-00085,2023-05-10-T-004,85,Tan See Leng,"The other point is that for firms, like what the hon Member has shared, if they are able to do ambitious investments, they have ambitious innovation and also broadly increased internationalisation activities, they can also tap on the Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities (M-SEP) scheme which is administered by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and we will certainly consider giving them time-bound flexibility to help all of these firms seize new opportunities. I hope that addresses the Member's question."
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00086,2023-05-10-T-005,86,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each of the past five years (a) what is the number of suspicious real estate transaction reports filed; and (b) what is the number of convictions on money laundering involving (i) residential real estate and (ii) commercial real estate in Singapore.
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00087,2023-05-10-T-005,87,Sun Xueling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) of the Singapore Police Force does not publicly release detailed statistics relating to the filing of suspicious transaction reports. The Police do not track money laundering convictions by asset class."
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00088,2023-05-10-T-005,88,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00089,2023-05-10-T-005,89,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just one supplementary question for the Minister of State. I think I understand that the requirements for developers to take certain anti-money laundering (AML) actions against money laundering will be effective from June of this year. So, to that extent, I wanted to ask what sort of safeguards will be put in place for secondary market transactions. The reason being especially if the developers actually put in place such safeguards for primary market transactions, then, potentially the bad actors could even turn to secondary market transactions should they have such intentions."
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00090,2023-05-10-T-005,90,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. Indeed, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has disseminated a guide on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism requirements to developers when issuing a sale license to developers. And, as he has mentioned, the Developers (Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2018 will be implemented on 28 June 2023. Under section 12D of this Act, when a licensed housing developer knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect any matter mentioned in section 45(1) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) or CDSA, a licensed housing developer must, in accordance with section 45 of the CDSA, disclose the matter to a  Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer"
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00091,2023-05-10-T-005,91,Sun Xueling,"When we look at the principles of reporting, as long as the developer is aware that in the course of the trade profession, business or employment, he knows or has reason to suspect that any property directly or indirectly represents proceeds of drug dealing or criminal conduct or was used or is intended to be used in connection with drug dealing or criminal conduct, that he is to lodge a suspicious transaction report."
2023-05-10-T-005-S-00092,2023-05-10-T-005,92,Deputy Speaker,"No further supplementary questions? Mr Louis Ng, next question."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00093,2023-05-10-T-006,93,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many Family Service Centres (FSCs) currently have a headcount dedicated for community work; and (b) whether the Ministry can provide more funding to FSCs to hire additional headcount dedicated for such work.
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00094,2023-05-10-T-006,94,Sun Xueling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) had replied to Mr Louis Ng in a similar Parliamentary Question (PQ) on 5 October 2021, sharing how MSF resources Family Service Centres (FSCs) to carry out case work, group work and community work. Our position has not changed and Mr Louis Ng may wish to refer to our earlier reply."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00095,2023-05-10-T-006,95,Deputy Speaker,Mr Ng.
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00096,2023-05-10-T-006,96,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister of State for the reply, but actually it is a different question. I am asking what is the average number of social workers in FSCs who are focused on community work? I ask this because they have provided feedback to me that FSCs and social workers really do want to focus on that, to go upstream, to solve and address some of the problems they are seeing downstream."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00097,2023-05-10-T-006,97,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"And the problem now is the lack of funding. I think MSF only provides funding for one headcount per FSC who handles a very large area. So, could I ask whether MSF can look into this further and study how we can help FSCs social workers do more community work?"
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00098,2023-05-10-T-006,98,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. I think for the benefit of everyone who is in Parliament, I would like to share and clarify that MSF provides funding to the FSCs for casework, group work and community work."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00099,2023-05-10-T-006,99,Sun Xueling,"The Member is specifically asking about community work. Now, what is community work? It refers to a method of social work intervention when the community setting is utilised to enhance individual and family social network support connections as well as to build capacity in local communities to respond to the needs of individuals and families. Right now, MSF funds the FSCs based on the actual number of cases managed, so MSF funds casework funding. So, it is not just one headcount that the Member has mentioned. The MSF funds two fixed headcount to carry out group work and community work and five other fixed headcounts for administrative and corporate functions."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00100,2023-05-10-T-006,100,Sun Xueling,"As to how the FSC wants to internally allocate work and the funding within the FSC, that is not something that MSF intervenes in, and it may change from FSC to FSC."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00101,2023-05-10-T-006,101,Sun Xueling,"But I would just like to assure the Member that we are fully supportive of what the FSCs are doing for individuals, families and the community, and our funding approach takes into account, as I mentioned, casework, group work and community work."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00102,2023-05-10-T-006,102,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Louis Ng, a short supplementary question please."
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00103,2023-05-10-T-006,103,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I understand all that and I agree with the Minister of State that we are doing quite a number of things for FSCs. But the short question really is can MSF just look into this and find out how many social workers are focusing on community work in FSCs? And then at least we can see the results of that and change our policies.
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00104,2023-05-10-T-006,104,Sun Xueling,I thank the Member for his supplementary question. I think there is no doubt that we want to help and assist and support our FSCs as much as possible.
2023-05-10-T-006-S-00105,2023-05-10-T-006,105,Sun Xueling,"His question has been phrased with regard to community work but community work cannot exist in silo. We are working with individuals and families at the end of the day, and it depends on what level of interventions are needed. And that is why I have taken some care to share that our support for FSC spans casework, group work and community work. We have different funding principles for the three categories. But depending on what the FSC sees as the needs in the community, the FSC may determine within themselves how to allocate work between the different functions and also to allocate the funding within the FSC."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00106,2023-05-10-T-007,106,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Prime Minister with regard to the job prospects for polytechnic graduates in the banking and finance sector (a) what are the available programmes to support internships and apprenticeships; and (b) what are the available skills upgrading programmes for further career progression.
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00107,2023-05-10-T-007,107,Liang Eng Hwa,Question No 7.
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00108,2023-05-10-T-007,108,Alvin Tan,"Sir, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Polytechnic Talent for Finance Scheme last month to encourage financial institutions to train and hire more polytechnic students and graduates. There are three tracks under the scheme."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00109,2023-05-10-T-007,109,Alvin Tan,"First, the Internship Track seeks to encourage financial institutions to train polytechnic students as interns and hire them upon graduation."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00110,2023-05-10-T-007,110,Alvin Tan,"Second, the Apprenticeship Track aims to provide polytechnic graduates an alternative pathway to acquire further skills to progress in their careers."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00111,2023-05-10-T-007,111,Alvin Tan,"And third, the Sponsorship Track encourages polytechnic graduates to stay in their jobs in the financial sector while they further their studies."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00112,2023-05-10-T-007,112,Alvin Tan,"MAS targets to increase the number of polytechnic graduates who take on full-time permanent jobs in the financial sector by more than 80%, from about 160 entering the sector in 2021 to at least 300 by 2025. While the financial sector already offers many internships to polytechnic students, there are much fewer apprenticeship programmes."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00113,2023-05-10-T-007,113,Alvin Tan,"MAS aims for the Apprenticeship Track to contribute the bulk of the target increase in the number of polytechnic graduates in the sector, or rather entering the sector. As financial institutions develop familiarity with the calibre of polytechnic talent and as polytechnic graduates gain a better appreciation of the opportunities in the financial sector, they can become a more significant source of talent for the sector over time."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00114,2023-05-10-T-007,114,Alvin Tan,"After polytechnic graduates join the financial sector, they can tap upskilling opportunities available to all financial sector professionals under MAS’ Talent and Leaders in Finance Programme. This programme includes a wide range of training courses subsidised under the Financial Training Scheme and Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) Standards Training Scheme. It also includes job rotations that provide training and mentorship, as well as overseas postings, to help finance professionals, including polytechnic graduates, advance their careers."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00115,2023-05-10-T-007,115,,"Besides supporting polytechnic graduates, there are schemes to help ITE students gain a head start in their careers. These include ITE's Work-Study Diplomas, which place students in jobs related to their discipline of study, while pursuing their diplomas. The Infocomm Media Development Authority's (IMDA) industry-led TechSkills Accelerator for ITE and Polytechnic Alliance also equips ITE and polytechnic students and graduates with skills to take up opportunities in tech sectors upon graduation."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00116,2023-05-10-T-007,116,,"MAS will continually review the talent development schemes, and engage the financial sector and higher education institutions, to meet the financial sector's manpower needs and create good opportunities for our people."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00117,2023-05-10-T-007,117,Deputy Speaker,"Minister of State Alvin Tan, just to check if your answer was meant to be in relation to both Question Nos 7 and 8? So, it was a combined answer?"
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00118,2023-05-10-T-007,118,Alvin Tan,"Apologies, Deputy Speaker. Yes, Question Nos 7 and 8. Thank you."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00119,2023-05-10-T-007,119,Deputy Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00120,2023-05-10-T-007,120,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, I thank the MAS for coming up with this scheme to enhance the career development of our polytechnic graduates. Sir, I have two questions for the Minister of State. Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister of State, what is MAS' assessment on the receptiveness of this apprenticeship programme by both the students and employers so far?"
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00121,2023-05-10-T-007,121,Liang Eng Hwa,"My second question is, I understand that in the early years, when we started as a financial centre, many of the international FIs, the banks like JP Morgan and UBS, they do take in non-graduates as trainees and many of them moved up to senior positions, including becoming CEOs of banks. So, I would like to ask the Minister of State, whether today, do our financial institutions still see the polytechnic graduates as a key source of talent pool and to develop long-term career plans for these polytechnic graduate employees to progress in the organisations?"
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00122,2023-05-10-T-007,122,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Today indeed, many polytechnic students are keen to pursue degrees instead of entering the workforce, because they perceive a university degree as essential to securing a good job and also to progress in their careers."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00123,2023-05-10-T-007,123,Alvin Tan,"On the employers' end, few of these employers offer apprenticeship programmes – like the one that I mentioned, the MAS scheme – particularly in the financial sector. Employers may not be rolling out these apprenticeship schemes as they are unfamiliar with the polytechnic talent pool, unfamiliar with the calibre of the polytechnic students and also face difficulties in hiring them or attracting them into the sector upon graduation."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00124,2023-05-10-T-007,124,Alvin Tan,"With the roll-out of this scheme, the Polytechnic Talent for Finance apprenticeship track, we hope to correct this misperception that a university degree is a prerequisite for a good job and a career progression in the financial services sector. This apprenticeship track incentivises financial institutions to develop these kinds of apprenticeship programmes that provide a clear path for deserving apprentices to be placed in university graduate-equivalent roles upon completion. We really hope that the introduction of the scheme will spur our FIs to develop more apprenticeship programmes for polytechnic graduates and create a new path for polytechnic students to take on as an alternative to pursue a university degree."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00125,2023-05-10-T-007,125,Alvin Tan,"I was at the launch of this scheme. I was speaking to both the financial institutions including JP Morgan as well as Allianz and many others and also the students there and the feedback was  one, that they are very keen to hire polytechnic students because the financial sector is hiring and the financial sector is a very dynamic sector; the second is that the students are also very open to taking on these  internships and apprenticeships; and for those who are working already in the financial sector, who want to take on or to do a degree, the third track helps them to do so."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00126,2023-05-10-T-007,126,Alvin Tan,"So, in speaking to JP Morgan and others, I think this is a scope that we want to expand to allow for the financial sector to take on a bigger talent pool. I am confident that our polytechnic talent is able to fulfil that."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00127,2023-05-10-T-007,127,Deputy Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00128,2023-05-10-T-007,128,Yeo Wan Ling,"I thank the Minister of State. Besides the Polytechnic Talent for Finance Scheme, are there other initiatives MAS is working on to increase hiring of polytechnic graduates into the financial sector?"
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00129,2023-05-10-T-007,129,Alvin Tan,"Sir, MAS as well as the  IBF will be organising round tables between FIs and polytechnics to strengthen the industry and academia collaborations in areas such as tightening the relevance to curriculum and to industry; what industry requires, industry's needs, and also enhancing the learning outcomes of internships."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00130,2023-05-10-T-007,130,Alvin Tan,"In addition, we are also going to make sure that there are going to be coordinated outreach efforts, such as career fairs and financial industry showcases to raise awareness and increase indeed, the students' awareness and interest in the financial sector. To give the Member an example, is the industry's showcase held at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic on 24 April which I attended in conjunction of the launch of the scheme, where financial institutions make presentations to polytechnic students and set up booths to interact with students."
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00131,2023-05-10-T-007,131,Alvin Tan,MAS is also exploring having finance professionals conduct regular sharing sessions on campus to increase students' understanding of developments and to work in the sector.
2023-05-10-T-007-S-00132,2023-05-10-T-007,132,Alvin Tan,"So, if you are a polytechnic student and you are interested in the financial sector, please look out for the myriad of opportunities available."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00133,2023-05-10-T-008,133,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the top five agencies commonly referred to by the Municipal Services Office (MSO) in relation to cases lodged through the OneService app for the past three years; (b) what is the average time taken to close the feedback loop for those cases from each of those five agencies; and (c) whether the MSO independently tracks, audits or verifies that the feedback has been acted upon by the relevant agency."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00134,2023-05-10-T-008,134,Sim Ann,"Sir, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), Land Transport Authority (LTA), National Environment Agency (NEA), National Parks Board (NParks) and Public Utilities Board (PUB), collectively accounted for 53% of municipal feedback that came through the OneService app from 2020 to 2022. The Town Councils handled another 44%."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00135,2023-05-10-T-008,135,Sim Ann,"From 2020 to 2022, these five agencies on average took between two and seven working days to close municipal feedback cases."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00136,2023-05-10-T-008,136,Sim Ann,"The Municipal Services Office (MSO) has been working with agencies to improve the timeliness and more importantly the quality of their replies to municipal feedback. For straightforward cases, agencies are expected to close the feedback loop only when they have resolved the issue on the ground, with a photo of the completed works where practicable. Such cases usually involve only one agency and are of a nature where clear, concrete actions can be taken to resolve the issue. For example, repairing faulty lighting or a broken footpath. This focus on true case resolution has been well-received by residents."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00137,2023-05-10-T-008,137,Sim Ann,"For transient issues like community noise, or complex cases, like those involving anti-social behaviour and enforcement action, agencies will respond to feedback providers on an action plan and indicative timeline to address the issues. For such cases, time is needed for thorough investigation and enforcement action. In such instances, MSO tracks the recurrence of the issue and works with the relevant agencies to better tackle the root causes."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00138,2023-05-10-T-008,138,Deputy Speaker,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00139,2023-05-10-T-008,139,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Minister of State and our officers from MSO for their hard work since 2015 on the OneService app. I understand that efficient and effective resolution of the issues much depend on the accurate characterisation and the details to be given. So, I can imagine it will be challenging for officers and agencies to route to the correct channels if such details are not given."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00140,2023-05-10-T-008,140,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"My questions are for the OneService app, how can it be further improved and would there be plans to further improve the app to ensure that users provide all the necessary information upfront and the details – perhaps by the use of ChatBots or AI or any other technology."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00141,2023-05-10-T-008,141,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Secondly, I think I heard from Senior Minister of State that there are action plans to manage the expectations of feedback providers that may take longer time. Would interim updates be provided through notifications?"
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00142,2023-05-10-T-008,142,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"And lastly, we should leverage on community resources. Can the local grassroots advisors be alerted where key issues on the ground crop up through the OneService app, so that we can leverage on our local resource partners and other community resources on the ground? For instance, in Keat Hong constituency, we have an estates task force made up of resident volunteers and some community leaders that actually complement the work of the grassroots advisors."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00143,2023-05-10-T-008,143,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Zhulkarnain, if I could ask you to wrap up, please."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00144,2023-05-10-T-008,144,Sim Ann,"Thank you, Mr Zhulkarnain, for the supplementary questions. Of the use of AI, that has already being done, for instance, through our OneService Kaki ChatBot. The ChatBot does use AI to prompt the feedback provider to give more details that allow us or our agencies to identify the location of the case being reported better. So, that is an example of how we are using AI."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00145,2023-05-10-T-008,145,Sim Ann,"In terms of interim updates  first, agencies can use the interim update function that is within the app, to provide some update to our feedback providers before the case is completely resolved. Also, for the high volume type of cases, when the case is being submitted, that will be a link appearing to a Ministry of National Development (MND) website, where, if the feedback providers so wishes, he can be informed on which are the types of cases that might take longer to resolve and why."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00146,2023-05-10-T-008,146,Sim Ann,"Mr Zhulkarnain also mentioned about the use of community resources and keeping grassroots advisors in the loop. We will study his suggestion. I am very encouraged to hear that he has a community task force and my team would be glad to discuss how we can support each other in better resolving municipal feedback cases. In terms of the volume that we handle, it is very high on a daily basis. So, I think we would have to think about how to provide the information in a more summarised form, for ease of partners that wish to work with us."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00147,2023-05-10-T-008,147,Deputy Speaker,Ms Hany Soh.
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00148,2023-05-10-T-008,148,Hany Soh,"Thank you, Sir. I have two supplementary questions in relation to the OneService app. The first is, what is the current subscription rate for the OneService app?"
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00149,2023-05-10-T-008,149,Hany Soh,"The second one is, apart from reporting a municipal issue, which my Parliamentary colleague has raised earlier, the OneService app provides many other useful services, such as rendering help to your neighbours and also in terms of finding out which are the nearest useful facilities near you. So, I wish to ask are there any plans to increase awareness and the take-up rates and whether more such useful services will be included in the app in due course?"
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00150,2023-05-10-T-008,150,Sim Ann,"I am happy to let Ms Hany Soh know that we have just crossed the half a million mark, in terms of user accounts registered with the app."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00151,2023-05-10-T-008,151,Sim Ann,"And in terms of further enhancing the app with more services beyond just reporting municipal feedback, yes, we have been doing so. We have a ""Help Neighbour"" feature and very recently, we also collaborated with a VWO on using the app to broadcast information about persons with dementia who may be who may have lost their way in the community and whose loved ones are very eager to find the person. We look forward to more of such collaborative opportunities so that we can leverage on the large user base to help improve lives for Singaporeans."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00152,2023-05-10-T-008,152,Sim Ann,"In terms of improving the use of the OneService app, yes, we are also constantly looking at digital and non-digital ways to promote the use of the OneService app to more potential users. For instance, we note that some outdoor advertising could be quite effective. So, we will also be deploying banners to some of our neighbourhoods so that people who might not already be seeing our digital publicity can also be aware that there is this app which they can download."
2023-05-10-T-008-S-00153,2023-05-10-T-008,153,Sim Ann,We will continue to take in more suggestions and feedback and I thank Members for being so supportive of the OneService app.
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00154,2023-05-10-T-009,154,Yeo Wan Ling,"asked the Minister for Transport for growing towns like Punggol where the demand on the LRT system can be very busy during peak times and drop drastically during non-peak times, whether the Ministry will consider supplementing the LRT system with more frequent bus services in the interim, if it is not yet feasible to bring in additional LRT train sets."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00155,2023-05-10-T-009,155,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Punggol LRT system operates at maximum capacity during the morning peak period. It is supplemented by 18 bus services that serve all the LRT stations and provide connectivity to the town centre and beyond."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00156,2023-05-10-T-009,156,Chee Hong Tat,"We are increasing public transport capacity in Punggol, in anticipation of new residents moving into the town. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) recently added frequency to some bus services and is using more double-deck buses. LTA is closely monitoring the situation and will add more bus trips during peak hours if necessary."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00157,2023-05-10-T-009,157,Chee Hong Tat,"From next year, LTA will progressively replace the existing one-car LRT trains on both Punggol and Sengkang LRT systems with new two-car LRT trains, to increase the overall capacity. The North East Line will also be extended to Punggol Coast next year, with the opening of a new Punggol Coast MRT station."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00158,2023-05-10-T-009,158,Deputy Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00159,2023-05-10-T-009,159,Yeo Wan Ling,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the good news. Indeed, my Punggol residents have often given the feedback on the crowded trains and they are frustrated when they are unable to get on the trains. especially in the mornings when they need to get to work and school on time. In fact, parents have told me that their kids are sometimes left behind on the platforms as they cannot get onto the crowded trains."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00160,2023-05-10-T-009,160,Yeo Wan Ling,"How would LTA and the Ministry ensure that passengers can enjoy smooth and convenient transitions between the use of the LRT and the increased interim bus services? I think our residents would want to make sure that the travel times as well as trips are done in a convenient and safe way, especially for the school children."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00161,2023-05-10-T-009,161,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Ms Yeo for her feedback. Indeed, I think we do need to make sure that the transport system as a whole, the different parts of it, work well together. Because from a commuter's point of view, you take bus and LRT, and you may switch to the trains for the longer part of the journey. One useful tool which I will encourage commuters to use, especially those who are more familiar with technology, is to download and use the transport app. That will show the possible journey options and also, which is the path that will give you the quickest way to get to your destination and also what are the connecting options available."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00162,2023-05-10-T-009,162,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I also want to express on behalf of LTA our thanks to the Grassroots Advisers from Punggol for working closely with us to give us feedback and allowing us to then look at what are some of the areas for improvement for Punggol residents."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00163,2023-05-10-T-009,163,Deputy Speaker,Mr Gan Thiam Poh.
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00164,2023-05-10-T-009,164,Gan Thiam Poh,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I just want to ask the Senior Minister of State whether there will be additional dual-trains for Sengkang LRT stations, as requested by my residents."
2023-05-10-T-009-S-00165,2023-05-10-T-009,165,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I mentioned this in my reply earlier. Maybe Mr Gan may have missed it. Starting from next year, we will be replacing the one-car trains with two-car trains on both Punggol and Sengkang LRT."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00166,2023-05-10-T-010,166,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Prime Minister in each of the past five years to date, what is the value of wealth inflows into Singapore (i) on aggregate and (ii) as broken down by the top 10 source countries."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00167,2023-05-10-T-010,167,Alvin Tan,"Sir, may I have your permission to take this question by Mr Louis Chua and the two questions filed by Mr Leong Mun Wai in yesterday’s Order Paper together, please."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00168,2023-05-10-T-010,168,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please proceed."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00169,2023-05-10-T-010,169,Alvin Tan,"Singapore is a trusted, vibrant and well-regulated international financial centre in Asia, one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Naturally, this has attracted a wide range of investors, including global and regional institutional investors as well as individual investors. Family offices are one particular category of individual investment."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00170,2023-05-10-T-010,170,Alvin Tan,The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not have comprehensive data on fund inflows into Singapore through family offices. Such detailed data is not necessary for MAS to carry out its functions of ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability. But let me share what we have.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00171,2023-05-10-T-010,171,Alvin Tan,Mr Louis Chua asked about wealth flows while Mr Leong Mun Wai asked about foreign funds inflow through family offices. I take their interest to be in investments made by high-end individual investors.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00172,2023-05-10-T-010,172,Alvin Tan,"The investor type closest to high-end individual investors in MAS’ annual Asset Management Survey is the category called “non-retail individual clients”. This category includes family offices, clients of external asset managers, private trusts and high net worth individuals. Based on the survey, the Assets Under Management (AUM) of foreign non-retail individual clients managed by financial institutions in Singapore increased by about S$470 billion from 2017 to 2021. This makes up about 20% of the increase in total AUM by Singapore’s asset management industry from 2017 to 2021."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00173,2023-05-10-T-010,173,Alvin Tan,"Also, the growth of assets from these high-end individual clients has been broadly similar to that for overall AUM. Let me explain. This, in other words, means that there has been a much broader pick-up of funds flowing into Singapore’s wealth management industry, but it is not peculiar to these high-end individual clients."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00174,2023-05-10-T-010,174,Alvin Tan,"There is no breakdown for family offices in particular in MAS’ annual survey, which I cited. However, Singapore family offices (SFOs) that apply for and are granted tax incentives by MAS managed about S$90 billion of assets as at 2021. This is less than 2% of the S$5.4 trillion assets managed in Singapore as at 2021."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00175,2023-05-10-T-010,175,Alvin Tan,"In short, the bulk of the increase in AUM in Singapore is attributable to institutional investors. Non-retail individual clients account for a small proportion, and family offices even less."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00176,2023-05-10-T-010,176,Alvin Tan,"Mr Louis Chua and Mr Leong Mun Wai asked for a breakdown by source countries of wealth inflows, and for Mr Leong Mun Wai, specifically for family offices. Based on the Asset Management Survey, non-retail individual clients come from a wide range of places. The most granular breakdown of foreign sourced funds is available by regions, rather than by specific countries."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00177,2023-05-10-T-010,177,Alvin Tan,"This is no different from surveys published by financial sector authorities or industry associations in major wealth management centres like London, Hong Kong and Switzerland. What we are providing on the regional breakdown for non-retail individual clients in fact goes beyond what these other jurisdictions publish as they do not put out data on specific categories of investors like individual investors."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00178,2023-05-10-T-010,178,Alvin Tan,"The top-sourced foreign region for the increase in Singapore’s AUM for high-end individual investors from that period of 2017 to 2021 was the Asia Pacific, as is to be expected. This accounted for slightly over half of AUM sourced from high-end individual investors. Asia-Pacific was followed by Europe and the Americas."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00179,2023-05-10-T-010,179,Alvin Tan,"Mr Leong asked how much SFOs that have applied for tax incentives since April 2022 have invested in local investments. We do not yet have the data as these SFOs have two years from their point of application to meet the local investments requirement that MAS just introduced in April 2022 – so, just one year ago. We are within the first two-year implementation period, so, data on the volume of assets is not currently available."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00180,2023-05-10-T-010,180,Alvin Tan,"Members of the House should note, however, that while assets are managed in Singapore by entities based in Singapore, most of these assets are invested outside Singapore. And this is understandable as the investment universe is much larger outside Singapore and investors use Singapore as a financial centre to access investment opportunities in our region and beyond. But as these assets are managed from Singapore, they help to create jobs and valued-added in our financial industry. There are also positive spill-overs to other sectors as these investors often appoint tax and legal professionals for wealth planning and operational matters. So, it benefits our financial industry and beyond."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00181,2023-05-10-T-010,181,Alvin Tan,"Mr Leong Mun Wai also asked about the impact of the inflow of foreign funds through family offices on our Official Foreign Reserves (OFRs), the private property market and inflation. Please allow me to set the context."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00182,2023-05-10-T-010,182,Alvin Tan,"The bulk of the gross inflows into Singapore comprise flows by financial institutions and other non-financial corporates, not high-end individual investors; and even less so family offices which are only one category within the latter."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00183,2023-05-10-T-010,183,Alvin Tan,"To reiterate, most of the funds managed here are invested in assets outside Singapore. Hence, they typically remain in foreign currencies – this is to the second point about the impact on OFRs. So, most funds are managed here, are invested outside and they also typically remain in foreign currencies and thus, have little or no effect on the Singapore dollar exchange rate or our OFRs. If some of these inflows do get converted into Singapore dollars, they would, just like all net capital flows into Singapore dollars, generate some appreciation pressure on the exchange rate. MAS addresses any such pressures, regardless of the source of funds, as part of its regular market operations to achieve its monetary policy objectives. We have not seen unusual surges of capital into the Singapore dollar that have required a pronounced response on MAS’ part, and certainly not from family offices which, to reiterate, would not form a significant portion of the total flow of funds for management out of Singapore."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00184,2023-05-10-T-010,184,Alvin Tan,"The third question by Mr Leong Mun Wai is on the impact on inflation. As for inflation, it has little to do with foreign fund inflows into Singapore, let alone the portion due to family offices. The step-up in core inflation since late-2021 was primarily due to the sharp increases in global energy, imported food prices and stronger domestic wage growth. These cost increases fed through to higher electricity and gas, food and essential services prices, accounting for nearly 75% of MAS' Core Inflation in 2022."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00185,2023-05-10-T-010,185,Alvin Tan,"And now, the impact on the private property market. Some foreign funds do flow into the private property market. However, purchases by foreigners have been relatively low, at about 4% of all private residential property purchases on average over the past three years. More specific to Mr Leong’s question, family offices themselves have had virtually no impact on our private housing market as there was no residential property transaction attributable to family offices over the last six years."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00186,2023-05-10-T-010,186,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00187,2023-05-10-T-010,187,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive replies. Just two quick supplementary questions. The first is in relation to my Parliamentary Question (PQ). I understand the Minister of State's point about the level of granularity provided, but I was just wondering in relation to the 14 April press release by MAS, it did state that the source of overall inflows into Singapore is diversified. So, I was just wondering if there is any further granularity that the Minister of State can provide to assure the public of the level of dispersion or concentration risks of any particular source country?"
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00188,2023-05-10-T-010,188,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Second, in relation to the PQ which was filed by Mr Leong Mun Wai, I also understand that at this point in time, because they are not at the two-year mark as mentioned by the Minister of State, we do not yet have that data. In terms of the level of local investment requirement, I recognise that this is indeed a good thing, but given that, as the Minister of State mentioned, most of it would presumably be invested in overseas markets, in overseas assets. Is there a push by the Government or MAS to, over time, nudge some of these companies to invest in local companies a little bit more, especially in the last category, when it comes to non-listed Singapore-incorporated companies, since these tend to give a greater multiplier effect —"
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00189,2023-05-10-T-010,189,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Chua, can I ask you to wrap it up?"
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00190,2023-05-10-T-010,190,Alvin Tan,I thank the Member the Member for his supplementary questions. I think I will talk about the first supplementary question which is effectively on source country breakdown.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00191,2023-05-10-T-010,191,Alvin Tan,"I had mentioned earlier on that, in fact, the source region is the Asia Pacific region, followed by Europe and Americas. We have given more details because, as I mentioned earlier on, of those centres that publish surveys quite similar to our MAS survey that I mentioned, none of the surveys published source country details. Some also do not even publish regional breakdowns. We have done so. I think that would suffice in terms of source country breakdown."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00192,2023-05-10-T-010,192,Alvin Tan,"With regard to the second question, I think I had responded to one of the Member's questions with regard to the requirements for SFO. We are still within the two-year period, so I encourage the Member and other Members of this House to ask again after the two-year period."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00193,2023-05-10-T-010,193,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00194,2023-05-10-T-010,194,Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Sir and I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive answer, especially with regards to my two PQs which were not successfully rolled over for today's Oral PQs. So, thank you for his answer. However, the —"
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00195,2023-05-10-T-010,195,Deputy Speaker,"Actually, we should clarify that the response was that the two PQs yesterday that were filed would be answered via Minister of State Alvin Tan's response today together with Mr Louis Chua's PQ. It was made known that the responses would be made today."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00196,2023-05-10-T-010,196,Leong Mun Wai,"Oh, yes, yes, it was in the Written Circular. Thank you."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00197,2023-05-10-T-010,197,Deputy Speaker,I wanted to be clear that there was not any avoidance in terms of answering the questions.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00198,2023-05-10-T-010,198,Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, yes. Thank you for the clarification. The Minister of State's answer mainly centred on the family office. Of course, I mean that is how I had phrased the question as well. So, I do not know whether it is fair to ask him now to answer one supplementary question on what is the impact of the total foreign inflow on our OFRs? On top of the family office, everything, for the last two to three years."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00199,2023-05-10-T-010,199,Alvin Tan,"Sir, just two points. The first is that we have every intention of answering those questions. The Member has reached out to me also. And specifically, the Member did not put it in time for it to be rolled over and so it was converted to Written PQs. And the team had very specifically noted that we wanted to answer both questions by Mr Louis Chua as well as Mr Leong Mun Wai as comprehensively as possible, which I had done so."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00200,2023-05-10-T-010,200,Alvin Tan,"The Member's questions on foreign funds inflow, it was specific to SFOs. So, if you wanted an answer to a broader question with regards to overall foreign funds inflow, may I ask the Member to file a separate PQ, which we will be happy to take at another Sitting."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00201,2023-05-10-T-010,201,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00202,2023-05-10-T-010,202,Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, just a narrow clarification for the Minister of State. If I heard him correctly, he said that foreigners accounted for 4% of private property transactions in the last three years. Can I clarify – does that classify Permanent Residents (PRs) as foreigners? And up until what point is this data available? I mean, is it as at the end of last year and we are counting the last three years from the end of last year backwards or so on? Just wanted to clarify that."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00203,2023-05-10-T-010,203,Alvin Tan,"I thank the Member for this supplementary question. Maybe, just let me give the Member a broader view. The foreigners' share of private housing purchase has dropped from about 20% in 2011 to about a low of about 3% to 4% over the past few years. Coming out of the pandemic, the share has remained limited – about 7% in the first quarter of 2023."
2023-05-10-T-010-S-00204,2023-05-10-T-010,204,Alvin Tan,"Again, the Member wanted more questions, I would ask the Member to file a separate PQ on foreign housing."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00205,2023-05-10-T-011,205,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the further measures that the Government can consider to control or moderate the Consumer Price Index (CPI) after having taken into consideration the main components causing the rise in the CPI in the last two years.
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00206,2023-05-10-T-011,206,Alvin Tan,"Sir, over the last two years, CPI-All Items inflation in Singapore rose from 2.3% in 2021 to 5.5% year-on-year in March 2023. The increase in prices was mainly driven by the higher costs of private transport and food."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00207,2023-05-10-T-011,207,Alvin Tan,"The Government has introduced comprehensive measures to help Singaporeans cope with inflation. First, through support programmes, such as  one, the latest tranche of CDC Vouchers in January; two, the Cost of Living Special Payment next month; three, the enhanced GST Voucher (GSTV) – Cash payment in August; and four, the Assurance Package Cash towards the end of the year."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00208,2023-05-10-T-011,208,Alvin Tan,"On average, for lower-income households, the enhanced GSTV scheme and Assurance Package will fully cover the increases in spending due to inflation and the GST rate increase this year. For middle-income households, the measures will substantially cover the increases in spending."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00209,2023-05-10-T-011,209,Alvin Tan,"Second, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s five monetary policy tightening moves since October 2021 have led to an appreciation of the Singapore dollar and helped temper imported cost increases, including for food. As I highlighted to the House in February this year, the effects of MAS' past tightening moves are expected to continue to dampen inflation over the course of the year."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00210,2023-05-10-T-011,210,Alvin Tan,"Third, while private transport costs have risen, the Government has ensured that public transport remains affordable. Every public transport journey is subsidised by the Government. In fact, the Minister for Transport added that more than $1 for every public transport journey, subsidised."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00211,2023-05-10-T-011,211,Alvin Tan,"In addition, one in two Singaporeans, including seniors and lower-wage workers, benefit from concessionary fares which are up to 70% less than adult fares. But I would like to assure the Member that the Government will continue to monitor consumer goods' price developments closely and be prepared to do more if necessary."
2023-05-10-T-011-S-00212,2023-05-10-T-011,212,Deputy Speaker,"No supplementary questions? Mr Alex Yam, next question, please."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00213,2023-05-10-T-012,213,Alex Yam,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment since the introduction of the guidelines for the usage of light emitting wreaths and inflatables at funeral wakes in June 2022 (a) how many complaints have been received relating to the flouting of the guidelines; (b) what have been the challenges of enforcing the guidelines; and (c) whether there will be a further review of the guidelines should concerns persist.
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00214,2023-05-10-T-012,214,Baey Yam Keng,"Sir, the guidelines on the use of light-emitting wreaths and inflatables at funeral wakes were co-developed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Association of Funeral Directors Singapore (AFD) in June 2022, to guide the funeral services industry and premises owners on the appropriate use of these items to ensure public safety and minimise disamenities."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00215,2023-05-10-T-012,215,Baey Yam Keng,"NEA has worked with the Town Councils and land agencies, which issue permits for wakes held in public residential estates, to promulgate these guidelines through the terms and conditions of these permits."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00216,2023-05-10-T-012,216,Baey Yam Keng,"From June 2022 to April 2023, NEA received about three cases of feedback per month on the use of light-emitting wreaths and inflatables at funeral wakes. Since the issuance of the guidelines to stakeholders, NEA and AFD have observed a decrease in feedback received. Feedback providers were mainly concerned with the excessive number of light-emitting wreaths and leaving them turned on after 10.00 pm. When such feedback is received, the respective Town Councils and land agencies would be notified to engage the relevant parties to address these concerns."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00217,2023-05-10-T-012,217,Baey Yam Keng,NEA will continue to work with stakeholders to monitor the situation and review the guidelines if necessary.
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00218,2023-05-10-T-012,218,Deputy Speaker,Mr Alex Yam.
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00219,2023-05-10-T-012,219,Alex Yam,"Thank you, Sir. I have one supplementary question. Understandably, of course, wakes are sensitive and emotional times for families. Therefore, also makes it difficult for agencies to enforce the guidelines, even with as much tact that is available, much less to remove the wreaths if they are any contraventions. It is also difficult for bereaved families to be able to advise well wishes not to send such wreaths beyond the advised number. Affected residents also understandably lean on agencies, such as the Town Council, to enforce what are advisories."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00220,2023-05-10-T-012,220,Alex Yam,"I would like to ask therefore, as the LED wreaths are recent innovation and not part of an established culture and tradition, would the Ministry not consider a blanket ban on such wreaths, considering that disamenities and potential safety hazards that they may pose to the public?"
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00221,2023-05-10-T-012,221,Baey Yam Keng,"I thank the Member for his questions. Indeed, the light-emitting wreaths are a more recent Innovation. But the display of wreaths at wakes are part of a cultural tradition. In fact, there are people who even think that using light-emitting wreaths are more sustainable because they can be reused and do not contribute to waste as compared to other traditional wreaths."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00222,2023-05-10-T-012,222,Baey Yam Keng,"But what is important is how are these light-emitting wreaths being used, whether they are placed and used in a responsible manner. Since the issuance of guidelines, the Town Councils and land agencies have incorporated the requirements within the guidelines into the conditions of their permits. So, the Town Councils land agencies are responsible to ensure adherence. But I note the Member's point that during bereavement, there needs to be a bit more sensitivity to enforce such guidelines."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00223,2023-05-10-T-012,223,Baey Yam Keng,"Therefore, we also worked concurrently with the funeral directors and the wreath suppliers. They are supposed to concurrently check in with the families on the site conditions and on how many light-emitting wreaths are already placed there, and only take on the orders when the conditions permit for them to deliver the wreaths."
2023-05-10-T-012-S-00224,2023-05-10-T-012,224,Baey Yam Keng,"NEA will continue to monitor the situation with various stakeholders and review the guidelines, if necessary."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00225,2023-05-10-T-013,225,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Defence what are the current guidelines for standards relating to full-time National Servicemen's accommodation in camps in terms of (i) the number of occupants per room (ii) the number of occupants per floor (iii) the amount of living space per occupant in terms of square metres, excluding shared living facilities (iv) ventilation requirements and (v) the ratio of occupants to available toilets."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00226,2023-05-10-T-013,226,Heng Chee How,"Mr Deputy Speaker, accommodation facilities in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are designed to be functional and cost-effective in supporting our operational and training requirements and meeting the health and well-being needs of its servicemen. The facilities are adequate, and comfortable and benchmarked to the guidelines of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) in areas including safety, ventilation design and sanitary provisions."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00227,2023-05-10-T-013,227,Heng Chee How,"The number of personnel per room ranges from two to 10, depending on the size of the rooms. On top of the shared living facilities, the individual sleeping and resting space for each serviceman is about seven square metres. The rooms are designed to make good use of natural ventilation and daylight. Typically, a four-person room has two ceiling fans and larger rooms may have more fans installed. Toilet and shower facilities are equipped with individual shower and toilet cubicles as well as urinals, with the guideline of five men to one toilet cubicle and eight men to one urinal."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00228,2023-05-10-T-013,228,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00229,2023-05-10-T-013,229,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. Could I just ask Senior Minister of State how new are these guidelines, whether they have been revised during COVID-19 to take into account the infection measures? Second, how regularly are these guidelines reviewed?"
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00230,2023-05-10-T-013,230,Heng Chee How,"I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. As I alluded to in my answer, our norms are developed in compliance with national regulations. So, every time that there will be improvements or changes to these regulations, then certainly, we will take them in to make sure that we remain up-to-date in our provisions."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00231,2023-05-10-T-013,231,Heng Chee How,"In terms of the improvements or adjustments that we have made to render our facilities more pandemic-ready, that too has been made. For continued operational readiness and effectiveness, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF)/SAF buildings and infrastructure must be pandemic-ready. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a proactive approach by the Army to procure additional fans and air purifiers, distributed across the Army to increase ventilation in office and accommodation spaces. In new projects or when existing infrastructure is refreshed, a key design consideration is flexibility to allow for adaptation to dynamic requirements."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00232,2023-05-10-T-013,232,Heng Chee How,"Among the considerations to ensure pandemic-readiness are  one, space planning for safe social distancing for crowd and transmission control; two, provisions for plexiglass or shield equivalence as separators; and three, anti-microbial coatings on common touchpoints."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00233,2023-05-10-T-013,233,Heng Chee How,"Natural ventilation is a key design consideration for MINDEF/SAF accommodation spaces. In August 2021, NEA concluded a study of MINDEF/SAF accommodation spaces which assessed the adequacy of ventilation in rooms using CO2 samples as proxy. This study found that these naturally ventilated accommodations spaces had good readings of less than 800 PPM CO2. In addition, relevant MINDEF/SAF departments have been incorporated as part of the NEA/BCA biosecure built environment workstream which deals extensively at the whole-of-Government level to meet SS553 and SS554 air quality standards."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00234,2023-05-10-T-013,234,Heng Chee How,"In the event of outbreaks, MINDEF/SAF also has protocols, such as  one, demarcating ring-fencing facilities; two, instituting isolation plans; and three, implementing medical plans to deal with the potential emergence of clusters."
2023-05-10-T-013-S-00235,2023-05-10-T-013,235,Deputy Speaker,"No further supplementary questions? Mr Lim Biow Chuan, next question."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00236,2023-05-10-T-014,236,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider a continuous nationwide education campaign to remind pedestrians not to use their mobile phones or any other electronic devices when using the roads.
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00237,2023-05-10-T-014,237,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) engage in extensive public education programmes and campaigns on path and road safety. This includes reminding pedestrians to stay alert to their surroundings when walking along paths and crossing the road."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00238,2023-05-10-T-014,238,Baey Yam Keng,"LTA has been promoting to path users the message of staying alert through various public campaigns and educational materials, such as the annual Move Happy Campaign. LTA also works with our Active Mobility Community Ambassadors and schools to educate pedestrians and students on safe and gracious path use, including not using mobile phones and electronic devices when crossing the road."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00239,2023-05-10-T-014,239,Baey Yam Keng,"Likewise, TP regularly conducts education and engagement programmes. As part of the Road Safety Month campaign in June 2022, TP produced infographics and video advisories to educate the public on pedestrian safety and the dangers of distracted crossing and jaywalking. In August 2022, TP organised the Road Safety Concert for Seniors to raise road safety awareness and to inculcate good road safety habits among the seniors."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00240,2023-05-10-T-014,240,Baey Yam Keng,These educational efforts are ongoing and we remain committed to inculcating a strong culture of safety and graciousness among all road and path users.
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00241,2023-05-10-T-014,241,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan. Incidentally, we will go up to 1.40 pm for Question Time today because Leader's speech at the start took up 10 minutes. So, we have another 10 minutes up to 1.40 pm."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00242,2023-05-10-T-014,242,Lim Biow Chuan,"Grateful, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I just wanted to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether LTA agrees that there are more pedestrians involved in traffic accidents and whether the current level of road safety education is adequate."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00243,2023-05-10-T-014,243,Lim Biow Chuan,"Just last month, the Courts made a pronouncement about the pedestrian who was knocked down because he followed jaywalkers blindly while crossing the road, and he was just looking at the phone. So, situations like that, and anecdotally I get a lot of feedback that drivers see that road users are not paying attention to cars at all. They are all looking at their phone, listening to their music. If this carries on, there would be more traffic accidents."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00244,2023-05-10-T-014,244,Lim Biow Chuan,"So, I was just wondering whether the Ministry of Transport (MOT) thinks the level of education of pedestrians is adequate. Many drivers tell me that they feel it is not enough and that the road safety message should be pushed further."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00245,2023-05-10-T-014,245,Baey Yam Keng,"Indeed, I agree with the Member, because a life lost is a life too much, too many. We want to prevent all casualties or fatalities arising from such accidents."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00246,2023-05-10-T-014,246,Baey Yam Keng,"But we also realised that when accidents happen, there could be a variety of reasons. Sometimes, it is a combination of reasons, where the pedestrian, the motorists and/or other road and path users are also responsible."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00247,2023-05-10-T-014,247,Baey Yam Keng,"Therefore, we would take a more holistic approach towards addressing this issue. Public education is one and this has to be targeted at all road and path users. LTA will work with Traffic Police and the Road Safety Council on this."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00248,2023-05-10-T-014,248,Baey Yam Keng,"At the same time, we also look at how we can improve road designs or enhance features such as Silver Zones and the recently announced ""Friendly Streets"" programme to make it safer for pedestrians to cross the roads."
2023-05-10-T-014-S-00249,2023-05-10-T-014,249,Baey Yam Keng,"All in all, we hope that all these will help to reduce incidences of accidents. More importantly, everybody must play a part in ensuring safety on roads and our paths."
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00250,2023-05-10-T-015,250,Ng Ling Ling,"asked the Minister for Health for advanced stage-4 or terminal cancer patients who will not be able to complete their treatments with non-Cancer Drug List (CDL) drugs by 30 September 2023, whether the Ministry will consider enabling them to tap on a higher MediSave amount to alleviate their financial worries."
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00251,2023-05-10-T-015,251,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, patients who are using cancer drugs that are not on the Cancer Drug List (CDL) may appeal to the Ministry of Health (MOH) to use more MediSave for their treatment."
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00252,2023-05-10-T-015,252,Janil Puthucheary,Subsidised patients being treated in public health care institutions can also approach the medical social workers to apply for financial assistance if they are unable to afford their healthcare bills.
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00253,2023-05-10-T-015,253,Janil Puthucheary,"Under the CPF Reduced Life Expectancy scheme, terminally ill patients may also withdraw their CPF savings including MediSave savings in a lump sum, subject to retaining a minimum balance of $5,000."
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00254,2023-05-10-T-015,254,Deputy Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00255,2023-05-10-T-015,255,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am just following up on the matter of appeals with regard to this subject. I have a resident who is in a similar predicament and I can imagine there are others. Does the Senior Minister of State have any indications on how many appeals have been forwarded to MOH for consideration, for cases where the drugs are not on the CDL anymore?"
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00256,2023-05-10-T-015,256,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I do not have the data on how many appeals have been forwarded to MOH. Perhaps Mr Singh might like to file a separate question on that."
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00257,2023-05-10-T-015,257,Deputy Speaker,"Ms Ng Ling Ling. A short supplementary question, please."
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00258,2023-05-10-T-015,258,Ng Ling Ling,"Yes, Sir. I thank the Senior Minister of State for a very assuring reply on appeals are allowed for MOH. I just wanted to ask two supplementary questions. One, the scenario I asked in my Parliamentary Question, if a patient which is at stage 4 or which is terminal, is the insurance company that is providing Integrated Plans (IPs) for cancer coverage, obliged to appeal to MOH for grandfathering, if the patient is supported by an oncologist's clinical recommendation that the patient should continue on this cancer treatment or drug, even though it is outside of the drug list?"
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00259,2023-05-10-T-015,259,Ng Ling Ling,"My second supplementary question is that for very rare cancer such as that of appendicitis, they are dropped into a general cancer category in CDL with the lowest subsidy caps. Can MOH consider to separate rare cancers out, for a clinical panel to evaluate them on a case by case basis for the cap?"
2023-05-10-T-015-S-00260,2023-05-10-T-015,260,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I would perhaps simplify the answer by saying that we would in these cases suggest that, whether it is the resident or the IP or the Member of Parliament representing the resident, the thing to do is to submit the appeal and we will look at it and assess the ways in which we can help that patient receive the most appropriate care – whether it is in the private sector, the public sector, whether it is about the drug or whether it is about the subsidy. There are a variety of mechanisms that we can use to try to find the best way to assist. I would encourage the Member to reach out, including to reach out to me, if necessary."
2023-05-10-T-016-S-00261,2023-05-10-T-016,261,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether he has reviewed the papers ""Social capital I  measurement and associations with economic mobility"" and ""Social capital II  determinants of economic connectedness"" published in Nature on 1 August 2022; and (b) how has the Ministry factored the findings of these papers into the Ministry's policy-making on social mobility."
2023-05-10-T-016-S-00262,2023-05-10-T-016,262,Eric Chua,"Sir, ideas in published academic journals are part of the broader understanding of issues that inform the Ministry's policy making process."
2023-05-10-T-016-S-00263,2023-05-10-T-016,263,Eric Chua,"If the Member has in mind any specific propositions from the cited papers that he feels is relevant in our policy context, he may wish to articulate them, so that his question can be addressed."
2023-05-10-T-016-S-00264,2023-05-10-T-016,264,Deputy Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. The Clerk will now proceed to read the Order of the Day.

2023-05-10-T-017-S-00269,2023-05-10-T-017,269,Deputy Speaker,Prof Koh Lian Pin.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00270,2023-05-10-T-017,270,Koh Lian Pin,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of this Motion. I would like to join the debate today by highlighting a growing healthcare issue facing the academic community."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00271,2023-05-10-T-017,271,Koh Lian Pin,"Our universities and academic institutions are places of higher learning, research and innovation. They are also workplaces where faculty members, researchers and students spend a significant amount of their time."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00272,2023-05-10-T-017,272,Koh Lian Pin,"In recent years the academic work environment has become increasingly stressful, leading to the rising incidence and prevalence of mental health issues among university researchers and graduate students."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00273,2023-05-10-T-017,273,Koh Lian Pin,"A global study conducted in 2018 found that 41% of graduate students worldwide suffered from moderate to severe anxiety, while 39% showed signs of moderate to severe depression. This survey which was based on the responses of over 2,000 students from 230 institutions across 26 countries reported that in general, graduate students are more than six times as likely to experience anxiety and depression compared to the general population."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00274,2023-05-10-T-017,274,Koh Lian Pin,There may be several reasons why mental health issues are becoming prevalent in academia. One of the biggest causes arguably is the constant pressure to perform.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00275,2023-05-10-T-017,275,Koh Lian Pin,"The academic path can be both long and narrow. It may also come with significant opportunity costs. Having committed typically around 10 to 15 of the most productive years in their 20s and 30s to acquiring an increasingly specialised skill set as an early career researcher, the scope for an alternative career tends to get increasingly narrower as they progress in their training as graduate student, postdoctoral researcher and then junior professor. The pressure to continue down this path and succeed as a tenured academic can be enormous."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00276,2023-05-10-T-017,276,Koh Lian Pin,"Additionally, the nature of academic research for some disciplines can be arduous and unpredictable. The demands of laboratory experiments or field surveys typically require individuals to work after hours and over weekends. These long, irregular and gruelling hours of research inevitably compromise work-life balance and can have significant impacts on the mental health of early career researchers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00277,2023-05-10-T-017,277,Koh Lian Pin,"Many of them are also at an age when they are trying to start a family, and so these mental health impacts may extend to their partners and other loved ones as well."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00278,2023-05-10-T-017,278,Koh Lian Pin,"Furthermore, many research-intensive universities now consider various publication related metrics when evaluating the performance of their faculty members and researchers. This can create a ""publish or perish"" mentality which in turn creates immense pressures, especially among early career researchers to publish quickly, frequently and in the most highly regarded scientific journals."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00279,2023-05-10-T-017,279,Koh Lian Pin,"A strong publication track record is critical for securing a good post-doctoral position and academic tenure. However, the overwhelming and constant pressure to publish can lead to persistent feelings of anxiety, resulting in burnouts and other mental health issues."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00280,2023-05-10-T-017,280,Koh Lian Pin,"Another major contributor to mental health issues among early career researchers is job insecurity. Many individuals who embark on an academic career may aspire to be a tenured professor someday. But there are just not enough professor positions for the growing number of PhD graduates to fill. Certainly, not in Singapore alone."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00281,2023-05-10-T-017,281,Koh Lian Pin,"As a result, many early career researchers are on short-term contracts supported by research grants. The duration and size of these grants can be variable and unpredictable, leading to uncertainties for long-term employment. This lack of job security can also lead to persistent stress and anxiety as researchers constantly worry about their next contract and future career prospects."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00282,2023-05-10-T-017,282,Koh Lian Pin,"Among graduate students, and especially for students from overseas who have come to Singapore to pursue their graduate research, the rising cost of living in Singapore is probably one of the greatest stress factors today. Many PhD students in Singapore are on research scholarships, which provide a relatively modest stipend compared to the salaries that their peers in the workforce may be getting. The constant cost of living concerns can lead to a vicious cycle of poor mental health and decreased academic performance, with individuals struggling to cope with the rigorous demands of academic life as graduate students while also managing their challenging financial situation as young adults."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00283,2023-05-10-T-017,283,Koh Lian Pin,"Finally, the academic culture itself can also be a significant barrier to addressing mental health. Indeed, there may be a common but misguided perception in academia that admitting to struggling with one's mental health is somehow a sign of weakness, incompetence or inadequacy. This stigma can lead individuals to feel like they need to hide their struggles to fit in or to maintain their academic standing among their peers. Left unchallenged, this stigma can cause individuals to delay seeking help or treatment for mental health concerns, which can lead to a worsening of symptoms and other detrimental impacts on their personal and academic life."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00284,2023-05-10-T-017,284,Koh Lian Pin,"To address the growing mental health issues facing the academic community, we may wish to consider the following suggestions, some of which are already being implemented in our local universities and research institutions, but we can always do more."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00285,2023-05-10-T-017,285,Koh Lian Pin,"First, we could invest more in mental health research to contextualise and better understand the extent and nature of the mental health problem within Singapore's academic community. This may help us develop more effective and bespoke solutions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00286,2023-05-10-T-017,286,Koh Lian Pin,"Second, we could provide more mental health support services, including workshops, support groups and mental health professionals to create an ecosystem of affordable and accessible mental health resources on campus for those in need."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00287,2023-05-10-T-017,287,Koh Lian Pin,"Third, we could make greater efforts to raise awareness and reduce the stigma associated with mental health in academia. Importantly, we could create a culture of openness and support by providing training for senior faculty and staff on how to identify and support individuals who may be struggling. By doing so, we can destigmatise and normalise our discussions on mental health."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00288,2023-05-10-T-017,288,Koh Lian Pin,"Finally, we could also do more to normalise a healthier work-life balance in academia. This may include providing more opportunities for remote work and flexible schedules and creating policies that limit after-work emails and meetings."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00289,2023-05-10-T-017,289,Koh Lian Pin,"As an encouraging example of what is already being done, the National University of Singapore has been running a #AreuOK mental healthcare campaign since 2021. Its main goals are to destigmatise mental health conditions in the NUS community and support those who seek help. It provides free and confidential mental well-being check-ins, emotional support sessions and a 24-hour hotline, among other services. I declare that I am an NUS professor. Of course, other universities in Singapore provide similar initiatives and support to their academic communities as well."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00290,2023-05-10-T-017,290,Koh Lian Pin,"At the national level, the Health Promotion Board runs our national mental well-being campaign, ""It's OKAY to Reach Out"", which seeks to normalise the topic of mental health and well-being, generate greater understanding and awareness and encourage Singaporeans to reach out for support."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00291,2023-05-10-T-017,291,Koh Lian Pin,"Sir, Singapore is a global leader in research and innovation. The quality of our universities and research institutions plays a critical role in maintaining this status. More importantly, a physically and mentally healthy research workforce, which includes graduate students and researchers at all levels, is needed to ensure the consistent production of top-quality research in Singapore."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00292,2023-05-10-T-017,292,Koh Lian Pin,"Furthermore, the academic community in Singapore is diverse and international, with individuals from different cultures, backgrounds and experiences working together towards the common goal of creating impactful, new knowledge, science and technologies. Providing a supportive and inclusive environment that promotes the mental well-being of all members of our academic community will enable us to attract and retain top talents from around the world and maintain Singapore's role as a global knowledge and innovation hub."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00293,2023-05-10-T-017,293,Koh Lian Pin,"Addressing mental health in academia is not just a moral imperative but also an economic one. The World Health Organization recently reported that depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy over $1 trillion every year. Another recent study by the Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health estimated the total economic burden of lost productivity due to anxiety and depression in Singapore to be almost $16 billion annually. By investing in mental health initiatives in academia, we can improve the productivity and performance of our academic workforce, which can have a positive impact on our economy as a whole."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00294,2023-05-10-T-017,294,Koh Lian Pin,"In conclusion, addressing mental health in academia is critical for Singapore to succeed as a knowledge and innovation hub, attract and retain top talents, strengthen our economy and build a resilient workforce and society."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00295,2023-05-10-T-017,295,Koh Lian Pin,"Let us work together to create a culture of openness, support and understanding in the academic community, where individuals can seek help without fear of stigma or judgement and realise their full potential."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00296,2023-05-10-T-017,296,Koh Lian Pin,"Finally, I joined my fellow Members in thanking the nurses, doctors and all healthcare workers for their indefatigable spirit, dedication and sacrifices in their contributions to the physical and mental well-being of our nation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00297,2023-05-10-T-017,297,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00298,2023-05-10-T-017,298,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when deciding how liveable and how advanced a society is, the quality and affordability of its healthcare sector play a key role."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00299,2023-05-10-T-017,299,Leon Perera,"In most countries, the nature of healthcare provision is highly contested and debated because of its critical importance. In many countries, including our own, healthcare is also a vital sector for the economy, creating many jobs directly and indirectly."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00300,2023-05-10-T-017,300,Leon Perera,"Post-COVID-19, I am hopeful that progress on constructing new facilities like the Woodlands Health Campus and the Integrated Care Hub at Tan Tock Seng Hospital is picking up. However, the main impediment – the main challenge – in meeting our long-term healthcare needs lies not in the building of physical facilities, it lies in the recruitment and retention and raising the productivity of our healthcare workers. It is this single theme that my speech will address today."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00301,2023-05-10-T-017,301,Leon Perera,"In my speech, which supports the Motion, I will talk about  (a) addressing recruitment and retention among healthcare workers; (b) raising the productivity of healthcare workers; and (c) improving the outcomes from the healthcare system as a whole without increasing cost proportionately by addressing sources of health problems upstream and by other means."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00302,2023-05-10-T-017,302,Leon Perera,"Before I proceed, I declare my interest as the chairman of a company that does consulting work in the healthcare space, among other verticals."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00303,2023-05-10-T-017,303,Leon Perera,"Sir, in preparing this speech, I raised the topic of how we can attract more Singaporeans into the healthcare sector at my family dinner table. Without a micro-second's hesitation, my daughter said, and I quote, ""Give them decent working hours, respect at work and good pay."""
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00304,2023-05-10-T-017,304,Leon Perera,"Indeed, this is a major long-term challenge we face. We can build the wards and clinics, we can buy the equipment, but how can we attract and retain workers in the sector such that churn is minimised, such that there is a core of professionals from whom future leaders can be drawn, such that there is a good learning curve, a sufficient accumulation of experience and skills to elevate service and effectiveness so as to ensure good outcomes for patients?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00305,2023-05-10-T-017,305,Leon Perera,"There are media and anecdotal reports of facilities that are unused due to a lack of manpower. For example, a recent report from TODAY, citing a private doctor, said, ""As a matter of fact, several private hospitals have closed some hospital wards and operating theatres due to a shortage of nurses.”"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00306,2023-05-10-T-017,306,Leon Perera,"The all-important manpower challenge in healthcare unpacks itself into a few bundles of issues – compensation, working hours, working conditions and career laddering, and productivity and, also, as part of that, that should address ensuring that the work feels meaningful."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00307,2023-05-10-T-017,307,Leon Perera,"Firstly, Sir, on compensation. While nurses' pay was increased last year – and this is welcome – this was the first base salary increase in seven years. Junior doctors' pay was increased as well recently but, as per the reply to my recent Parliamentary Question (PQ) on this, the 7% to 13% starting salary increase applies to house officers and first-year medical officers (MOs). However, more experienced junior doctors, namely, eligible in-service MOs or residents up to postgraduate Year 6 and dental officers up to postgraduate Year 4, could expect a salary adjustment based on their years in service and bond period rather than an across-the-board increase, as I understand it."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00308,2023-05-10-T-017,308,Leon Perera,"Clearly, to attract and retain talent, compensation has to be competitive. Moreover, in healthcare, talent can migrate across national borders. Many countries are short of experienced healthcare staff. Many countries would like to poach our English-speaking and well-trained healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00309,2023-05-10-T-017,309,Leon Perera,"Hence, I would like to ask if compensation for healthcare personnel could be monitored and tracked based on hourly compensation – total pay per hour worked – and regularly benchmarked against other developed country locations against which we compete for healthcare talent, with the results published so that we have a clear indicator of how we are doing and whether or not we will face choppy waters ahead that we would need to take heed of."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00310,2023-05-10-T-017,310,Leon Perera,I am aware of academic studies that are occasionally published to this effect but I am not aware that there is a regular Government publication to this effect.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00311,2023-05-10-T-017,311,Leon Perera,"Next, Sir, on managing working hours and burnout. There is no point raising pay if there is under-capacity and working hours rise after that such that pay per hour remains the same or actually falls."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00312,2023-05-10-T-017,312,Leon Perera,"Sir, I have raised this in the House previously in relation to the issue of junior doctors' working hours a few times. I would like to repeat my call to lessen the weekly working hour requirement for junior doctors from 80 to 70 and to step up enforcement to make sure that this is adhered to."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00313,2023-05-10-T-017,313,Leon Perera,"There is evidence that the same training outcomes can be obtained with a cap of 70 hours per week versus 80, as I explained in my previous Committee of Supply speech. This would also require systems to be streamlined so that junior doctors and, indeed, nurses, spend more time on patient care and training rather than administrative tasks."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00314,2023-05-10-T-017,314,Leon Perera,"I would also repeat my calls to move towards 100% compliance with the current 10-hour intervals between duty periods and after in-house calls, up from 90% now, ensuring no under-reporting of hours and taking concrete steps to shorten the time spent on handing over administrative and peripheral duties."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00315,2023-05-10-T-017,315,Leon Perera,I understand that conditions for junior doctors are being reviewed in the public healthcare system now. I hope that the need to optimise working hours will be fully considered in that process.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00316,2023-05-10-T-017,316,Leon Perera,"Next, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on workload. Workload is, of course, a function of healthcare demand vs manpower capacity. Healthcare demand will rise steadily as our population ages and, indeed, we are one of the fastest-ageing populations in the world."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00317,2023-05-10-T-017,317,Leon Perera,"Minister Ong has said that the annual intake of nursing students will rise from 2,100 to 2,300 a year. This should help with meeting demand if nurses stay in the profession."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00318,2023-05-10-T-017,318,Leon Perera,"Right now, the proportion of Singaporeans among enrolled nurses is a little over 60%. It is important for such a critical profession to maintain a strong Singapore Core and good career progression for nurses who can progress into more senior nurse practitioner and leadership roles."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00319,2023-05-10-T-017,319,Leon Perera,"I know that there are currently nursing scholarships primarily awarded by the healthcare clusters. I wonder if this number is sufficient to meet the needs of the future to generate enough of a pipeline of nurses for future senior nurse practitioner, mentoring and leadership roles."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00320,2023-05-10-T-017,320,Leon Perera,"Does the Ministry review the number of nursing scholarships given with this in mind? Do such reviews extend to the awarding of a sufficient number of postgraduate scholarships in nursing, given the increasing complexity and technology dependence in the healthcare sector going forward? Currently there appears to be only one academic programme which provides a Masters in Nursing requirement for advanced practice nurses."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00321,2023-05-10-T-017,321,Leon Perera,"Lastly, on the topic of workload. So as to strengthen the Singapore Core in professions like nursing, we should provide preferential consideration to foreigners who are in these professions who have lived and worked here for some time and have demonstrated a capacity to integrate well into our society to obtain permanent residency and, eventually, citizenship."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00322,2023-05-10-T-017,322,Leon Perera,"I believe some other Members of this House have called for this before and the Government has said it is open to such an idea. To add on to this, I would repeat my call for the giving of citizenship to be made more transparent, with the availability, for example, of an online points-based calculator, similar to what you see in some other countries. This may make Singapore more attractive to healthcare professionals from other countries by providing more clarity and assurance."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00323,2023-05-10-T-017,323,Leon Perera,"Next, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the role of pharmacists. To raise the productivity of our whole system, will the Government consider giving pharmacists some powers to prescribe drugs for certain conditions? This is already being considered in Australia, though there has been some pushback associated with this. Our pharmacists already make adjustments to dosing of drugs for some chronic medications, and advanced practice nurses also have cooperative prescribing models in our local healthcare institutions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00324,2023-05-10-T-017,324,Leon Perera,"I would like to suggest that the Government monitor international developments and consider if and how to accord greater powers for prescription to pharmacists, depending on the emerging international evidence. This may negatively impact general practitioners (GPs) initially but I have some suggestions relating to GPs which I will come to in a minute."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00325,2023-05-10-T-017,325,Leon Perera,"Next, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the necessary role of other allied healthcare professionals and medical personnel. I note that the Government has plans for a greater role for community pharmacists in promoting things like health screening and vaccinations."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00326,2023-05-10-T-017,326,Leon Perera,"I spoke about the vital role of both health screening and vaccinations in my Adjournment Motion on preventive healthcare last year as well as via PQs previously. MRNA technology is already spawning potentially revolutionary developments in medicine that could lead to radical breakthroughs in decades to come. But turning back to current realities, it would seem that we are lagging behind many developed countries in terms of the more routine types of vaccination, like influenza vaccines. This can limit the incidence of chronic or catastrophic conditions further downstream."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00327,2023-05-10-T-017,327,Leon Perera,"Moreover, alarmingly, the National Population Health Survey 2021 showed that fewer Singapore residents participated in chronic disease and cancer screenings in 2021, compared to 2019."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00328,2023-05-10-T-017,328,Leon Perera,"There are plans to raise the number of allied healthcare professionals. Such professionals can play a critical role in community healthcare, nudging healthier lifestyles and appropriate help-seeking behaviours, including for mental health conditions, as well as helping those with chronic conditions prevent the development of complications."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00329,2023-05-10-T-017,329,Leon Perera,"In the Serangoon ward of Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC), my volunteers and I have had the honour of working with Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Community Partners to conduct a health talk and consultation session at a rental block. We also refer cases we come across to TTSH Community Partners, or TTSH CP, which also stations nurses at the Community Care Services Singapore facility at Golden Ginger in Serangoon North at certain times, to make some screening and advice available to the people who live in the area."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00330,2023-05-10-T-017,330,Leon Perera,"These are commendable and beneficial interventions, and I hope that these can be replicated in other areas that currently lack this. These should eventually be funded centrally as they do not require costly infrastructure and could also allow local nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and podiatrists with families to, perhaps, work part-time near their homes in their own communities."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00331,2023-05-10-T-017,331,Leon Perera,"The model for deployment of such allied healthcare professionals is often to leverage events that attract people to consider health issues. However, some evidence from a survey conducted by Lifebuoy suggests that most Singaporeans take a rather passive approach to their own health and do not often or always proactively seek out information on how to improve their health. Hence, it behooves us to find methods that are more in line with what, in business marketing, is referred to as ""hunting"", that is, direct sales, as opposed to ""farming"", or attracting people to come to you."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00332,2023-05-10-T-017,332,Leon Perera,"To that end, I wonder if, once we have the health coaches in sufficient numbers, we can, as one initiative, deploy them to void decks, hawker centres and wet markets. These are areas of high footfall, particularly among older people, who may benefit more from healthcare interventions. It may be helpful if personnel who are fluent in vernacular languages can approach them in these settings, in a more proactive way, to promote ideas, such as vaccination and health screening, or even to perform certain basic screening activities on the spot. For younger demographic segments, what might work better are, perhaps, strategies that rely on social media."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00333,2023-05-10-T-017,333,Leon Perera,"Next, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me move on to the role of GPs. Our roughly 1,800 GP clinics play an important role in our healthcare system as the first line of defence for non-emergencies. This role is set to increase with the advent of Healthier SG. When we speak of attracting and retaining good healthcare professionals in our system, we should not neglect our GPs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00334,2023-05-10-T-017,334,Leon Perera,"Yet, there are worrying signs. In a survey of 300 GPs by NTU published in the journal BMC Primary Care in 2022, 14.4% said they plan to leave general practice permanently, 12.6% plan to take a career break, and 51.3% plan to reduce their clinical hours. Higher remuneration, recognising general practice and family medicine as a medical specialty, and reducing the litigious pressures on medical practice were rated as the most important factors in these decisions, while there was growing dissatisfaction within this community with the third-party administrators that manage insurance arrangements. If there are too many exits from the GP sector, this may dent our ability to achieve our primary healthcare and Healthier SG goals."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00335,2023-05-10-T-017,335,Leon Perera,"Also, a study of primary healthcare quality by the National Healthcare Group published in the journal ""Asia Pacific Family Medicine"" in 2014, which polled 85 experts, concluded that Singapore's system suffers from several issues, and I quote  ""The primary care system in Singapore received an average of 10.9 out of 30 possible points... Singapore was categorised as a 'low' primary care country according to the experts."" The earnings of primary care physicians, compared to specialists, were one of several factors cited."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00336,2023-05-10-T-017,336,Leon Perera,"Sir, I have a few suggestions here to address some of the issues faced by the GP population and primary healthcare in general."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00337,2023-05-10-T-017,337,Leon Perera,"Firstly, should we not regularly survey our population of GPs to understand their experience, their pain points, their perception of gaps in the ecosystem and their suggestions to the Government, insurers and other stakeholders? In my opinion, most of our GPs are thoughtful and well-informed individuals, who should have good ideas for constructive policy change. The Ministry of Health (MOH) does Primary Care Surveys every 10 years or so to determine, primarily, the economic parameters around the primary care sector, but much more can be done."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00338,2023-05-10-T-017,338,Leon Perera,"Secondly, can the Government explore onboarding individual GPs and corporate groups that run GP clinics onto the Government procurement system for drugs, so that all parties can obtain lower prices on the basis of larger bulk purchases? Right now, drug sales representatives often sell drugs to individual GPs. And this means fragmentation and far less bargaining power and economies of scale."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00339,2023-05-10-T-017,339,Leon Perera,"As an aside, I was once queuing to see a GP and someone behind me in the queue got in to see the GP before me. I did not mind, but I was just curious. So, I went up to the receptionist and I asked the receptionist why this happened and she said she had deprioritised me as I was wearing a tie at the time and she thought I was a drug sales rep rather than a patient."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00340,2023-05-10-T-017,340,Leon Perera,"Anyway, I understand that the Government is currently studying the idea of allowing private healthcare providers to tap on the Government drug procurement system, or ALPS, and I hope the Government will move on this soon to enable combined purchasing across the public and private sectors to the fullest extent practicable."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00341,2023-05-10-T-017,341,Leon Perera,"Lastly, would the Government, as part of the surveying effort I referred to earlier, identify GPs who have spare capacity – meaning that there are certain times of day when they do not see so many patients – and find ways to engage such GPs to augment the capacity in polyclinics or other public healthcare institutions, if they are keen to do so? Anecdotally, it seems that the density of GP networks has seen some long-term increase and competition has risen. One effect of this may be that some GPs – not all – have some spare capacity at certain times of the day, on certain days."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00342,2023-05-10-T-017,342,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I come now to the last part of my speech – how do we raise the labour productivity of our healthcare workers? I am reminded of an amusing conversation I had once as a young Economic Development Board (EDB) officer. One of my colleagues was talking to another manager. The manager said that he could not increase output without a commensurate increase in headcount, to which, the first person said, ""Ah, yes, but that assumes zero productivity growth."" I have never forgotten this little bit of wisdom, so pithily conveyed."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00343,2023-05-10-T-017,343,Leon Perera,"Of course, as healthcare demand grows, we will need to hire more staff. But we need to manage the rate of that increase so as to manage cost, as well as to manage population pressures that may arise from excessive inflows of foreign manpower – and I use the term ""manpower"" here in a gender-neutral way, of course."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00344,2023-05-10-T-017,344,Leon Perera,"How can this be done? There are advances in healthcare technology to draw upon and best practices available worldwide. For example, telemedicine can enhance staff utilisation and save time for patients as well. Some survey evidence suggests that Singaporeans are open to virtual consultations. There is also robotics. For example, service robots could perform some of the functions of a healthcare concierge. Robotics devices can also play a role in rehabilitative medicine."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00345,2023-05-10-T-017,345,Leon Perera,"I am aware that some of these innovations have come to our healthcare system and more are being considered. I am also aware that this is not a new topic. In 2012, MOH launched the Healthcare Productivity Roadmap and, in 2017, MOH announced the Healthcare Productivity Fund. There are also the National Healthcare Productivity and Innovation Awards. However, I have a few suggestions here."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00346,2023-05-10-T-017,346,Leon Perera,"Firstly, the potential to apply cutting-edge developments in fields like artificial intelligence (AI), computing and robotics to healthcare is high. For example, a 2019 Accenture study on Singapore's health workforce concluded that technology could free up 10% of time for doctors, 10% for pharmacists, 22% for nurses, 31% for laboratory scientists, 50% for pharmacy technicians and a whopping 68% for medical records clerks in Singapore."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00347,2023-05-10-T-017,347,Leon Perera,"My suggestion here is that the Government measure healthcare labour productivity from time to time and publish the results, benchmarked against productivity standards in other global cities. I think it would be useful to make city-by-city comparisons in this regard. There would be various types of metrics that could be considered. Ideally, we should measure public and private healthcare separately for the sake of comparison. And this data could be used to identify good outliers, where best practices and case studies can be documented and shared. If we do not know where we are at, we cannot get to where we want to go."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00348,2023-05-10-T-017,348,Leon Perera,"Secondly, and specifically for mental health care, this is an area where we are seeing challenges. Some experts speak of a youth mental health crisis, a phenomenon which may not be unique to Singapore by any means. Our ratio of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists lags behind some other developed countries, a subject that I and other Members have raised previously. Will the Government explore using AI technology to augment capacity in mental healthcare?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00349,2023-05-10-T-017,349,Leon Perera,"For example, a Boston-based company called ""OM1"" recently built an AI platform called ""PHenOM"" to help psychiatrists enhance their diagnostic and treatment effectiveness and efficiency. Singapore-based company Holmusk has partnered the UK's NHS and Liverpool University to establish a mental health analytics and research hub. Holmusk's mental health analytics platform is of a large scale. I hope the Government will consider working with companies like this, particularly locally based ones, to push the envelope."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00350,2023-05-10-T-017,350,Leon Perera,"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our future is one where demands on our healthcare system will be greater, as our population ages. But our future is also one where there will be greater opportunities to exploit technology and innovation to increase efficiency; and to enhance prevention upstream. We need to grasp the opportunities to meet those challenges."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00351,2023-05-10-T-017,351,Leon Perera,"And this will have to be done by our healthcare professionals, the people who must be at the heart of all we do in healthcare, for, without them, nothing is possible. At the end of the day, healthcare is, and will remain, must remain, a profoundly human endeavour. There is no more important goal in healthcare than attracting, retaining and bringing out the best from our great healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00352,2023-05-10-T-017,352,Leon Perera,"And before I conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would just like to join my hon friend Mr Gerald Giam and other hon Members of the House in expressing our whole society's profound gratitude to our wonderful nurses, and to wish them in advance a very happy Nurses' Day to come."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00353,2023-05-10-T-017,353,Deputy Speaker,Mr Mark Chay.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00354,2023-05-10-T-017,354,Mark Chay,"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak on this Motion put forth by my fellow Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) Dr Tan Yia Swam, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Mr Abdul Samad to support healthcare beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and call for a whole-of-Government effort for consistent and sustainable support. Sir, I stand in support of this Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00355,2023-05-10-T-017,355,Mark Chay,"I would like to start by extending my heartfelt gratitude to the healthcare professionals in Singapore, who have shown extraordinary dedication and selflessness in their efforts to care for patients amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the tremendous increase in demand for medical services, they have continued to provide exceptional care with professionalism and empathy."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00356,2023-05-10-T-017,356,Mark Chay,"We are truly indebted to our healthcare workers and administrators for their tireless efforts throughout this challenging period. Your courage and resilience have made a tremendous impact in our fight against the pandemic, and I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your incredible work."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00357,2023-05-10-T-017,357,Mark Chay,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore Government provided the healthcare workers with vital support in the form of financial assistance, resources and training to help them manage their increasing demands while treating COVID-19 patients. The contributions of our healthcare professionals should not, however, only just be recognised during times of crisis. We should still recognise their invaluable contributions moving forward, as we work towards living in a world with COVID-19, post-COVID-19."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00358,2023-05-10-T-017,358,Mark Chay,"It is easy to overlook the exceptional healthcare system in Singapore and fail to appreciate the dedication and hard work that go into providing top-notch healthcare services across the country. The Government has invested significantly in public health infrastructure and subsidised medical care, making it possible for Singaporeans to receive adequate medical attention when required, regardless of their financial background. And we should continue to uphold this, not because we want to remain competitive globally, but because it is the responsible thing to do for Singaporeans."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00359,2023-05-10-T-017,359,Mark Chay,"Mr Deputy Speaker, healthcare is a critical issue that concerns everyone because everyone needs access to healthcare at some point in their lives. Good health is essential for individuals to lead productive and fulfilling lives, and access to quality healthcare is crucial for maintaining good health. And because healthcare impacts everyone, I was happy to see this Motion tabled. I fully agree with the hon Members that we should take a whole-of-Government approach to healthcare."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00360,2023-05-10-T-017,360,Mark Chay,"This is critical because it recognises that healthcare is not just the responsibility of the healthcare sector, but also involves many other sectors and factors. By taking a comprehensive approach, Singapore can identify and address the root causes of healthcare issues and improve health outcomes for its citizens. I want to speak on the following four points which I believe should be given more attention."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00361,2023-05-10-T-017,361,Mark Chay,"First, on accessibility of healthcare services for the elderly and persons with disabilities. Singapore's population is ageing and the demand for geriatric services looks to increase.  As our population ages, it becomes more disposed to chronic medical conditions, cognitive impairments, falls, frailty which can significantly impact the quality of life. This calls for specialised knowledge about the ageing process and the optimal management of multiple medical conditions, medications and physical impairments."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00362,2023-05-10-T-017,362,Mark Chay,"Teaching Singaporeans how to age is something which should be invested in as well, and a holistic approach is required, prioritising not just diagnosis and treatment but also functional ability, social interaction and psychological well-being. For this purpose, it will be good if MOH can work with SkillsFuture to increase the access and adoption of courses which are suitable for our seniors. Courses, such as arts, nutrition and digital literacy, exist. However, I believe more can be done to provide more physical and mental well-being courses."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00363,2023-05-10-T-017,363,Mark Chay,"With an increasing Singaporean population of elderly individuals, the importance of gerontology cannot be understated, as it enables our silver generation to maintain independence, improve outcomes and live fulfilling lives."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00364,2023-05-10-T-017,364,Mark Chay,"Mr Deputy Speaker, ensuring healthcare access for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) is also essential for promoting equitable and inclusive healthcare. Unfortunately, PwDs often face barriers to accessing healthcare, including physical, communication and attitudinal barriers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00365,2023-05-10-T-017,365,Mark Chay,"I am happy that steps have been made to make healthcare more accessible for PwDs, such as accessible facilities like wheelchair ramps, height-adjustable examination tables and accessible bathrooms. In addition to existing efforts, healthcare providers may improve communications for the visual and hearing impaired by ensuring that their staff is trained in sign language or providing communication aids such as hearing aids or visual aids."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00366,2023-05-10-T-017,366,Mark Chay,"In addition to physical accessibility, healthcare providers can also improve their attitudes towards PwDs by providing education and training for their staff. They can also work towards promoting disability inclusion in healthcare policies and procedures."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00367,2023-05-10-T-017,367,Mark Chay,"Currently, there are many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) that are in the space of enabling PwDs and it would be good to have more dialogues on continual improvement of services for PwDs and increasing access and awareness of such services for PwDs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00368,2023-05-10-T-017,368,Mark Chay,"By taking these steps, healthcare providers can ensure that PwDs have access to the same quality of healthcare services as those without disabilities. It is essential to prioritise accessible and equitable healthcare to better build a healthier and more inclusive society."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00369,2023-05-10-T-017,369,Mark Chay,"I now move on to my second point, as we celebrate the triumphs of our Team Singapore athletes in Phnom Penh, we should also recognise the hard work and sacrifice our athletes and their entourage have made to bring glory to Singapore. Our elite athletes often face intense physical and mental pressures. These pressures can affect their performance, long-term physical health and overall well-being."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00370,2023-05-10-T-017,370,Mark Chay,"To excel in their sport, athletes must maintain a rigorous training discipline, adhere to strict dietary requirements and overcome physical injuries. Unfortunately, these pressures can often lead to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00371,2023-05-10-T-017,371,Mark Chay,"In addition to physical pressures, many athletes face significant social pressures. They may feel pressure from teammates, coaches, fans and the media. This can lead to additional mental health problems, including stress, burnout and a lack of self-confidence."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00372,2023-05-10-T-017,372,Mark Chay,"Elite athletes need access to resources to help them cope with these pressures. This can include mental health support, sports psychology and mentoring from experienced athletes."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00373,2023-05-10-T-017,373,Mark Chay,"It is also essential for athletes to understand that it is okay to prioritise their mental and physical health over their sport. Many athletes, such as May Ooi and Constance Lien, have recognised this and have become advocates for mental health awareness and self-care."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00374,2023-05-10-T-017,374,Mark Chay,"By acknowledging the pressures that elite athletes face and providing the necessary support, we can help them perform at their best while maintaining their long-term physical and mental health. Therefore, I hope that more support can be put into handling these unique needs of our national teams."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00375,2023-05-10-T-017,375,Mark Chay,"Third, on creating a vibrant sports and fitness culture. It is true that we often take our health for granted until an event impacts us directly. Recently, a friend passed away from a heart attack. He was still young and his tragic and sudden death ignited conversations amongst my peers about being healthy versus being fit, as well as our general education on health and well-being. It would be good if MOH and the Ministry of Education (MOE) together with SportSG teach Singaporeans at a tertiary level how to exercise when Singaporeans enter the workforce. There is a difference between training and exercising. We participate in Co-curricular activities (CCA), and sports CCAs teach you how to train – push your physical boundaries for performance, but exercise is about maintenance, mobility and lifestyle."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00376,2023-05-10-T-017,376,Mark Chay,"Exercise should be a habit and a lot to do with forming habits has to do with convenience, routine and accessibility. Some Members may know that Dr Tan Yia Swam is an avid parkour practitioner. Parkour, is a sport of jumping, climbing and sliding over and through a terrain. In Singapore, this happens to be an urban terrain and I am happy to see that such projects and facilities being built in Somerset and Lakeside."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00377,2023-05-10-T-017,377,Mark Chay,"I hope more urban-centric sport facilities will be built to match Singapore's landscape and interests. I hope and would also like to also encourage programmes to go together with these facilities. To do that, instructors need to be trained, qualified and hired. I am happy to see that at this year's Committee of Supply (COS), the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) announced a registration of personal trainers that cover a range of activities and disciplines. But to empower this registry, the trainers need to have updated and relevant content to teach. I would encourage SportSG, Health Promotion Board (HPB), MOE and People's Association (PA) to have more discussions about the delivery of relevant, age-appropriate physical programmes that cater to a vibrant, active Singapore population."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00378,2023-05-10-T-017,378,Mark Chay,"Fourth, verbal abuse towards frontliners working tirelessly to keep society functioning during this pandemic is a deplorable issue. Despite their unwavering commitment to rigorous job demands, healthcare workers, essential workers and other public-facing roles have been subject to verbal abuse, shaming and criticism."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00379,2023-05-10-T-017,379,Mark Chay,"In addition to it being emotionally draining, verbal abuse can lead to mental and physical health issues and impact the professional and personal lives of those affected. Therefore, it is crucial to recognise the value of our frontliners and to show support by offering gratitude, recognising their hard work and taking ownership of our collective responsibilities. Frontliners deserve our fullest respect, support and empathy."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00380,2023-05-10-T-017,380,Mark Chay,"Recognising and addressing this issue is vital in holding those responsible accountable for their actions. Healthcare facilities can provide training for their staff to de-escalate tense situations and implement policies for reporting and addressing verbal abuse. In addition, public campaigns can educate people on the importance of respecting frontline workers and the consequences of their actions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00381,2023-05-10-T-017,381,Mark Chay,"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has showcased the bravery, dedication and selflessness of our medical workers and workforce at the forefront of fighting the virus. They have worked long hours under challenging conditions while risking their health to care for patients. As the pandemic begins to subside, the Government must continue to support medical workers even after the pandemic."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00382,2023-05-10-T-017,382,Mark Chay,"I would like to ask the Government for healthcare workers to be provided with ongoing mental health support to deal with the psychological impact of their experiences. The pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health and well-being, and they must receive support and resources to deal with any long-term effects."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00383,2023-05-10-T-017,383,Mark Chay,"Our Government should also invest in health and safety measures to protect medical workers from future pandemics. This includes providing adequate personal protective equipment, training and vaccination. Healthcare workers at the forefront of infectious disease outbreaks must be thoroughly protected against any potential hazard they may face in the future."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00384,2023-05-10-T-017,384,Mark Chay,"By showing support and appreciation for medical workers after the pandemic, we create a sense of value for their role within our society.  Their sacrifice and hard work deserve recognition, and this can go a long way in keeping them motivated and inspired. The Government should continue to support medical workers to build a brighter future for our healthcare industry and the patients that rely on them."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00385,2023-05-10-T-017,385,Deputy Speaker,Dr Wan Rizal.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00386,2023-05-10-T-017,386,Wan Rizal,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank hon Members, Dr Tan Yia Swam, Mr Abdul Samad and Dr Shahirah, for raising this Motion. As Members of Parliament, we share the same goal  to create a healthier, more resilient Singapore, for generations to come."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00387,2023-05-10-T-017,387,Wan Rizal,"Our nation's healthcare system is an essential part of that objective and I am grateful for the opportunity to engage in a constructive dialogue on this vital issue. I want to touch on two broad topics. First, and unsurprisingly, on mental health and second, on our efforts in the Malay Community through the ""Saham Kesihatan"" initiative."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00388,2023-05-10-T-017,388,Wan Rizal,"Sir, mental health is a crucial component of our healthcare system. It is integral not only to an individual's well-being but also to the health and productivity of our society. I am glad that Dr Tan Yia Swam brought it up. We must acknowledge the challenges posed by Dr Tan Yia Swam head-on and continue to work collaboratively to find effective solutions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00389,2023-05-10-T-017,389,Wan Rizal,"Conversations around mental health have become much easier amongst Singaporeans over the years and this is not a coincidence. It is made possible by the efforts from the Government through the Inter-Agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, private sectors, community partners and ground-up groups to destigmatise mental health issues."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00390,2023-05-10-T-017,390,Wan Rizal,"While we have made strides in terms of awareness on mental health, we must recognise that there is still much to be done, particularly in how we can directly mitigate issues of mental health."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00391,2023-05-10-T-017,391,Wan Rizal,"I want to revisit some of the points raised in my Adjournment Motion back in 2020 to align with Dr Tan Yia Swam. During that speech, I shared the acronym ""LAST"". Briefly, ""L"" for literacy, ""A"" for accessibility, ""S"" for screening and ""T"" for time-outs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00392,2023-05-10-T-017,392,Wan Rizal,"Being an educator, I truly share Dr Tan Yia Swam's sentiment on the importance of education. We must continue to raise mental health literacy among our citizens. It should be introduced early, starting with our schools. Therefore, I am glad that MOE has refreshed our youths' curriculum that covers physical, mental and emotional well-being."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00393,2023-05-10-T-017,393,Wan Rizal,"But I hope we can impact mental health more directly, go beyond education or awareness and include mental health screenings as part of our regular physical health screening. The intention is simple, we want to create some normalcy and promote early detection and intervention of mental health issues, leading to better outcomes and quality of life for individuals. It would also be helpful to reduce the societal burden of untreated mental health issues and contribute to the overall well-being of our community."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00394,2023-05-10-T-017,394,Wan Rizal,"Now, I am confident that we can foster a community that eradicates mental health stigmatisation. But I also have to remind myself that such shifts in mindsets will not come easy, will not come instantaneously nor come so soon. And like many education programmes, changes can take quite some time."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00395,2023-05-10-T-017,395,Wan Rizal,"As a teacher 20 years ago, I had students who needed special attention in class. People questioned me on why I bothered to take such differentiated approach at that time. Twenty years on, we can observe that people, the society, have become accepting, and thanks to the efforts of both public and private sectors including advocates like Hon Member and Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency (GRC) colleague, Denise Phua, students now who require special attention in class are now embraced and provided with timely and appropriate intervention."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00396,2023-05-10-T-017,396,Wan Rizal,"Although we have not achieved the same level of acceptance for mental health, we must persevere. We must continue with a ""whole-of-society"" approach towards mental health and this means an active participation from the whole-of-Government, private sectors, community partners, ground-up groups and religious organisations."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00397,2023-05-10-T-017,397,Wan Rizal,"As Members of Parliament, we must wholeheartedly believe in this cause and strive to make it a reality. I commend the efforts by Members of this house and those before us who have been advocating for mental health. When we, as a society, a whole-of-society amplify the voices of those who have experienced mental health issues, we help to break down the barriers that prevent individuals from seeking help and create a more inclusive and supportive environment."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00398,2023-05-10-T-017,398,Wan Rizal,"Sir, beyond education and screening, and speaking about mental health, accessibility to mental health services remains the most crucial in encouraging individuals to seek for help. We want them to access mental health services without fear or stigma, discrimination or barriers such as cost, waiting time, transportation, or even distance. Additionally, it is important to create a supportive and welcoming environment so that they can feel comfortable and feel safe to seek help without any shame or judgement."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00399,2023-05-10-T-017,399,Wan Rizal,"I am glad that MOH has increased the number of access points via the polyclinics and telehealth services, making mental health services more widely available to people in need. However, I am aware of the shortage of trained mental health professionals who can provide effective and evidence-based treatment for those seeking help. Due to the lack of resources, people who need help may turn to untrained mental health practitioners or rely on self-help resources, this may not provide the same level of support and expertise as a trained one. This, too, can lead to inadequate or harmful treatment, worsening the individual's mental health and overall well-being. Therefore, we must continually review our mental health infrastructure, I hope we regulate this profession."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00400,2023-05-10-T-017,400,Wan Rizal,"Sir, Dr Tan and Mr Abdul Samad highlighted problems faced by healthcare workers. I want to draw focus on the mental well-being of our healthcare workers. The nature of their work is more than just a job; it is a calling that requires deep commitment and dedication. We must provide support and resources to help them cope with the stress and challenges inherent in their professions, which will ultimately lead to improved patient care."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00401,2023-05-10-T-017,401,Wan Rizal,"Moreover, we must address the harassment and abuse faced by healthcare workers, both physically and online, as it directly impacts their mental well-being. We not only must create a safe and supportive environment for our healthcare workers but enact clear guidelines to protect them. Thus, I am grateful that the authorities will take a zero-tolerance approach and will take appropriate actions against individuals who harass or abuse our healthcare workers. We must say, “If you abuse our healthcare workers, there will be consequences”. I look forward to the implementation of the measures to protect them. Sir, in Malay, please."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00402,2023-05-10-T-017,402,Wan Rizal,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Minister Masagos recently announced that the Malay community has shown progress in several health indicators.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00403,2023-05-10-T-017,403,Wan Rizal,"This includes the number of Malay patients with high blood cholesterol. However, we still need to continue efforts to look after our community's health. Our community's obesity rate is the highest compared to the other groups. As we are aware, obesity can lead to health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, among others. Therefore, Minister had announced the establishment of a fifth focus area for M3 so that it counts as one of our community’s priorities."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00404,2023-05-10-T-017,404,Wan Rizal,"This new focus area, through the Healthy Investment programme under M3, aims to mobilise our community to be ready for the Healthier SG programme. This programme is in line with Healthier SG's goal of making disease prevention a personal commitment. We need to take proactive steps to undergo frequent health screenings, adopt an active lifestyle and have a healthy diet."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00405,2023-05-10-T-017,405,Wan Rizal,"Besides individual efforts, this whole-of-community initiative can also bring about changes. This is where the Healthy Investment Programme by M3@Towns can provide opportunities for physical activities, raise awareness on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and identify potential risks linked to obesity."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00406,2023-05-10-T-017,406,Wan Rizal,"By working with other agencies such as HPB and Active SG, and as individuals making healthy choices, we can continue to progress and improve the health of our community and reduce the prevalence of obesity and other health-related issues."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00407,2023-05-10-T-017,407,Wan Rizal,I urge our community to take this opportunity to participate in the activities organised by M3@Towns.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00408,2023-05-10-T-017,408,Wan Rizal,"Remember, it is our obligation to stay healthy. And if we are healthy, we will be able actively contribute to our family and the development of our community and nation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00409,2023-05-10-T-017,409,Wan Rizal,"(In English)  As we continue the discourse on our healthcare system, it is important to acknowledge that we have a strong foundation and must continue to build on it. As individuals, we must recognise the vital role each one of us plays in shaping the fabric of our society. It must always be a whole-of-society approach. Each individual in our society serves as a vital cog in this complex machinery of our nation’s well-being. Every cog, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, contributes to the smooth operation and overall success of the system. And when one individual is down, others must step up to care and help. It is only through our collective efforts, with each and everyone of us working in harmony, that we can make a lasting, positive impact on the health landscape of our cherished nation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00410,2023-05-10-T-017,410,Wan Rizal,"Sir, at this juncture, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the NMPs for raising this crucial Motion. Their passion, deep knowledge and unwavering commitment to balance meaningful, insightful discourse throughout their time in Parliament have not gone unnoticed."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00411,2023-05-10-T-017,411,Wan Rizal,"Sir, to conclude, let us remember that progress in healthcare, its continued success depends on our collective determination and unity. Together, we can build a brighter, more resilient and healthier future for all."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00412,2023-05-10-T-017,412,Deputy Speaker,Ms Janet Ang.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00413,2023-05-10-T-017,413,Janet Ang,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion put up by hon NMPs, Dr Tan Yia Swam, Mr Abdul Samad and Dr Shahira Abdullah."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00414,2023-05-10-T-017,414,Janet Ang,"Over the past few months, we have debated on Healthier SG and then the White Paper on COVID-19 Response. Minister Ong has also updated this House on the three strategic pillars of Singapore healthcare going forward – acute care, public health and aged care. There were also several Forward SG dialogues giving birth to lots of ideas and initiatives. I applaud MOH and the whole-of-Government for the comprehensive holistic approach that is being taken, but we must all recognise that this is a marathon and not a sprint."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00415,2023-05-10-T-017,415,Janet Ang,"There is a lot to be done and will need whole of Singapore to be committed to act together for a healthier Singapore especially as we mature rather rapidly in age. Continued dialogue amongst all stakeholders is very important to listen, to clarify, to prioritise issues and to collaborate on solutions as we move forward, will be a key imperative."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00416,2023-05-10-T-017,416,Janet Ang,"For this debate, I will focus my attention on what the community and the private sector can and ought to do to complement and supplement the whole-of-Government efforts to support our healthcare workforce and our healthcare strategic transformation initiatives. Inevitably, I will also have policy consideration questions and recommendations which I hope MOH and the whole-of-Government can consider to take on board."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00417,2023-05-10-T-017,417,Janet Ang,"I have five topics for discussion. Firstly, respect and gratitude for our healthcare workers. Considering that Singapore’s healthcare system is ranked amongst the best in the world, I think it is time for the users of our Singapore healthcare system, that is patients, families, visitors, all of us to aspire to be ranked amongst the “most gracious” in healthcare systems."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00418,2023-05-10-T-017,418,Janet Ang,"There sometimes is this unrealistic expectation of “being served” in hospitals.	Asking	to be served water much like what we would do at a restaurant is the wrong expectation.	Overusing of call buttons for minor requests is not being considerate. And hurling abuses at anyone, let alone folks who are actually helping us, is absolutely unacceptable. Instead, a smile, a ""please"", a ""thank you"" would go a long way to show some consideration and appreciation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00419,2023-05-10-T-017,419,Janet Ang,"Hospitals are high-stress places. I am sure the healthcare staff are trained to be empathetic and sympathetic, which if not so, they should be. Still, the families and the patients should not think it our right to let go of our anger and frustrations on the healthcare staff, be they doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, support care staff or even the hospital security guards. Take a deep breath. Think of one thing we are grateful for. And consider the wise age-old golden rule  “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00420,2023-05-10-T-017,420,Janet Ang,"That said, still, there will be bad behaviours and I support MOH’s plans to have a concerted, across-the-board policy to handle and address the bad apples amongst us even as I wish and hope that as a community, we can all do better."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00421,2023-05-10-T-017,421,Janet Ang,"The second point, community involvement. Nurses, allied healthcare and care support workers will become increasingly important along with family physicians, doctors and medical specialists, as Singapore heads into becoming a super-aged nation. The community ourselves must recognise that we have just as important a role to play."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00422,2023-05-10-T-017,422,Janet Ang,"The first order of the day is to individually keep an active and healthy lifestyle to prevent chronic illnesses. As part of the Healthier SG, the system will incentivise positive behaviours, and poor healthcare lifestyles and behaviours should be disincentivised or penalised."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00423,2023-05-10-T-017,423,Janet Ang,"Next, the community can help ourselves by forming little support groups among residents or neighbours to support one another. These little support groups can be like little satellites receiving and disseminating correct, right healthcare-related information. Each general practitioner (GP) can be Advisor to a few groups to check in with them, to advise on activities or even join in, similar to what Members of Parliament do in a constituency. These groups can organise themselves with some governance and help to visit their neighbours and bring those in need for hospital checks, check that they are taking their medication and so on."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00424,2023-05-10-T-017,424,Janet Ang,"I understand that some of this is already happening but perhaps not in a cohesive, organised way. I guess the best example is whatever we managed to rally during COVID-19. So, now, in peace times, how do we repeat that? Going forward, we can be more coordinated and more collaborative. Then, the community may organise health screening, community exercises like Zumba, hikes to MacRitchie, Tai Chi and so on. The issue is how to get more people involved and keep it sustained. Maybe with Healthier SG, where you have credits for participation and these can be used for healthcare or purchase of healthy staples like oats, milk and so on."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00425,2023-05-10-T-017,425,Janet Ang,"In my speech at the Healthier SG debate, I shared about GoodLife! Makan at Block 52 Marine Terrace, an initiative of Montfort Care FSC as well as	“Share-a-Pot” at the Caritas Agape Village in Toa Payoh. These and other ground-up initiatives like the SG Mental Well-being Network or the Family of Wisdom by Dementia Singapore or Caring Commuter Champions who assist our public transport commuters who have visual impairment or physical disabilities or may be seniors with dementia, during their daily public transport commute. These are examples of what the community can do to be a part of the Singapore healthcare ecosystem."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00426,2023-05-10-T-017,426,Janet Ang,"Serendipity has it that I just attended this morning a heartwarming Sing Out Loud! performance at Esplanade by nine seniors with dementia accompanied by nine Kindergarten 1 and 2 children. The seniors are residents of the St Joseph's Home and the children are preschoolers attending the childcare centre which is located in the same compound as the St Joseph's Home Infant and Childcare Centre. Sing Out Loud! or 大声唱 is a community engagement programme by Esplanade, developed in partnership with Dementia Singapore in 2016, but this is the first time involving an inter-generational group."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00427,2023-05-10-T-017,427,Janet Ang,"It will be remiss of me not to mention the Convent Yuki and the flourishing fund initiatives sprouted out when friends transitioned into the second half of their retirement and supported seniors like my mother-in-law Mrs Lily Chia to continue having a meaningful and reasonably active life even into their 90s. By the way, my mother-in-law celebrates her 100th birthday next week."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00428,2023-05-10-T-017,428,Janet Ang,These kind of initiatives can become a part of the Healthier SG community partnership. It would be wonderful to see how these can qualify or be recognised under the rewards of Healthier SG as well.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00429,2023-05-10-T-017,429,Janet Ang,"One last point on community involvement. With an ageing population, it may soon become an imperative for everyone to be equipped with care skills. Perhaps that will come a time for everyone to be trained in basic nursing and care skills and be providing the services in their own families or communities or to be involved in some form of national community services. This could apply to young men as part of their National Service and for young ladies as part of their pre-IHL community service training. This can also apply to retirees as well. It could be a voluntary basis or perhaps even considered as some form of paid gig work of sorts."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00430,2023-05-10-T-017,430,Janet Ang,"My third point  shortage of nurses and allied healthcare workers. Minister Ong has shared often enough that the key challenge in our hospitals is to have sufficient nurses, allied health professionals and support care staff to operate hospitals, clinics and eldercare centres. When there are insufficient nurses and allied healthcare workers, the in-service staff including junior doctors all have to take up the slack, resulting in everyone overworking, experiencing burnout and mental wellness issues. In having to manage the COVID-19 response since 2020, our healthcare workers must likely added several years to their age."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00431,2023-05-10-T-017,431,Janet Ang,How is MOH addressing these issues? How can the private sector help? What can the community do to support?
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00432,2023-05-10-T-017,432,Janet Ang,Some ideas include
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00433,2023-05-10-T-017,433,Janet Ang,"(a) broadening training and responsibilities for existing nurses, allied health professionals and pharmacists so that they can take on crucial roles alongside doctors. This can help make these pertinent roles more attractive to Singaporeans. A lot, I know, is already being done by MOH in this aspect but more still yet to be done."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00434,2023-05-10-T-017,434,Janet Ang,"(b) nurses' pay is also being reviewed and implemented which is great. My point is that we have to align to pay for skills. When it comes to compensation, more is always welcome. That said, from the conversations I have had, what carries more weight when choosing nursing and allied health as careers is not exactly money. Please pay them enough. If they want to make lots of money, they will go and become investment bankers and so on. But what is important is being on a role that is respected and appreciated, having more flexibility so that work life balance can be better achieved and having the opportunity for career progression and personal growth, perhaps being able to say that living a life with a purpose."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00435,2023-05-10-T-017,435,Janet Ang,"(c) the community can help by changing our mindset when it comes to perceiving and treating ""service"" staff. Our nurses and allied healthcare professionals should be treated with every dignity, respect and gratitude."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00436,2023-05-10-T-017,436,Janet Ang,"(d) designing human resource (HR) policies that offer opportunities for them to choose pathways to progress in their career toward further certifications and even degree qualifications, granting study leave and examination leave for those doing their part-time degree or part-time specialised training, much like what we do for the doctors. These staff often struggle with roster and they feel bad for requesting shifts. If we are serious about lifelong learning, this is something that needs to be addressed. It need not necessarily be fully paid leave but just provide some flexibility in rostering."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00437,2023-05-10-T-017,437,Janet Ang,"(e) technology can automate repetitive work and augment the skills of the nurses and healthcare staff. Singapore is well recognised for our innovations on the world stage as amongst the top dozen or so healthcare systems that leverage technology well. Whether it is Robotic Process Automation (RPA) or artificial intelligence (AI) or data analytics, they have been proven to support positive patient outcomes, in addition to efficiency and effectiveness in the organisation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00438,2023-05-10-T-017,438,Janet Ang,"Mindset change and ease of adoption are key challenges that need to be done. One good example is the use of sensors to read vital signs, reducing the time nurses and doctors have to spend going from patient to patient to take their vitals physically. That is one and grumble. I have got plenty to give but, due to short of time, I will just go straight to the point."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00439,2023-05-10-T-017,439,Janet Ang,Jobs that are well assisted and enhanced with technology are more attractive especially for the younger generation. I am sure it is already doable for robots to serve the medication based on the barcode of the patient's tag and the day will come when barcode can read our retina and serve out the correct medication.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00440,2023-05-10-T-017,440,Janet Ang,(f) design scheduling system that can accommodate flexible shifts/hours. Such a system will be very attractive for staff who needs to juggle work with family and caregiving duties as well as studies as pointed out earlier. This may attract also retired nurses or part-time nurses to return to the workforce.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00441,2023-05-10-T-017,441,Janet Ang,"I understand from the Singapore Nursing Association that there is already a ""return back to nursing"" scheme for those who left for family reasons. I understand, however, that the Singapore Nursing Board has stopped registration for previously-registered nurses who have not been practising in the field for more than five years. Some of these nurses have had years of experience prior to their break and would like to rejoin the service but perhaps, are experiencing difficulty getting back their registration. With appropriate retraining, this would be a good pool of candidates to bring back into the workforce, at an appropriate level and not make them start with the junior nurses all over again."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00442,2023-05-10-T-017,442,Janet Ang,"There is also a Nursing Career Conversion programme and this programme, I hear, has been pretty successful in terms of enrolment. It will be interesting to get the statistics on the number of jobs which get filled by the graduates of such programmes and schemes."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00443,2023-05-10-T-017,443,Janet Ang,"(g) for foreign nurses and allied health staff, not being able to bring their family with them seems to be the biggest bugbear especially as other countries dangle that benefit. We know it is a challenge for Singapore but perhaps, MOH, Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can share the strategy for attracting and retaining foreign nurses and allied health professionals?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00444,2023-05-10-T-017,444,Janet Ang,"(h) what can the community do? Well, I hope that all parents can do our part to encourage our children who went overseas to attain their healthcare degrees and qualifications, to come home. I would recommend for MOH to do for nursing and allied health professionals, the same or similar as what is being done to attract overseas medical school graduates who are Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) to return and work here. I hear that our marketing campaign makes the graduates feel very much needed."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00445,2023-05-10-T-017,445,Janet Ang,"(i) one last point on this issue of manpower shortage. We might want to incentivise qualified professionals who are Singaporeans and PRs schooled and qualified overseas to return to Singapore and take up the open positions and get themselves registered. I have heard anecdotal stories that Singaporean physiotherapists who are qualified to practise in Australia, cannot get registered in Singapore. Apparently, they are expected to have undergone the same breadth of training as Singapore-trained physiotherapists. Perhaps, MOH can consider conditional registration for these overseas qualified physiotherapists and allied health workers, while they take up continuous learning in the subjects that might not have been part of their training overseas. In this way, we bring home another Singaporean son or daughter, who becomes a plus to our workforce."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00446,2023-05-10-T-017,446,Janet Ang,"Four, how can private sector play a part. There will always be senior doctors who, after their training, opt out of the public system, quit and go private. That is a perennial challenge for the public sector in the management of specialists. To have a Healthier SG, we need all hands-on deck."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00447,2023-05-10-T-017,447,Janet Ang,"One suggestion is for private sector specialists to regularly attend to subsidised patients on a pro bono basis or subsidised rate or they could run free clinics for those assessed to be unable to pay. Execution may not be easy but as during COVID-19, we see how the private sector healthcare was roped in and played an important role in complementing public healthcare resources. In this regard, we can learn from the legal community."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00448,2023-05-10-T-017,448,Janet Ang,"With the Healthier SG, general practitioner (GP) doctors and family medicine clinics are going to be the key nodes of care, in the community. I am sure that MOH is constantly reviewing the split between various specialisation. It is quite clear that we should be encouraging more junior doctors to specialise in family medicine and pursue the path of becoming GPs or family doctors. From my understanding, family medicine is already a speciality. What will it take to attract more medical officers to choose the family medicine route? How many training positions are there each year if we are successful in convincing medical officers that it is as good as any other specialisation?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00449,2023-05-10-T-017,449,Janet Ang,"Private sector GPs and clinics must step up to offer specialisation traineeships for our junior doctors. And we probably need to look into pay gaps amongst these specialities. What will it take to motivate the GPs to engage and be part of the primary care network so that together, we can work toward a common goal of preventive health?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00450,2023-05-10-T-017,450,Janet Ang,"The new capitation funding model will play a key part and it needs to be designed to incentivise as well as disincentivise behaviours at all levels of care, including the GPs and the population. Prevention and going upstream has been proven to be the best way to improve clinical outcome. For example, at Intermountain, they incentivise the primary care network to keep people out of hospitals as much as possible. For their diabetic population, they invested additional 4% of budget in this group and achieved a decrease in hospital admits by 22% and a decrease of 21% for other avoidable visits and admissions, resulting in overall improvement in value of care and reducing overall costs over time. In Singapore, we should perhaps look to modelling something similar."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00451,2023-05-10-T-017,451,Janet Ang,"One of the issues that I hear often is that GPs are not set up to handle and cope with the increased administration and IT workload. It might be worth considering for MOH to set up a standardised platform or for an agency or a private sector to provide the administrative services required to be done at scale. It is important that the GPs step forward and engage themselves in the redesign of work processes and incentives that will help make Healthier SG implementation efficient, effective and most importantly, deliver on its intended purpose. The GPs need to lean in, to help themselves and to help reinvent primary care for our Singapore healthcare ecosystem, help technology to help our medical teams."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00452,2023-05-10-T-017,452,Janet Ang,"Five, home medical care. For a sustainable healthcare system, home medical care must play a key part in the continuum of care. A doctor friend shared that there was a scheme at one time, which has since been pulled back, where post-delivery patients could go home because there were nurses visiting baby and mom for three days after discharge. This would be the kind of domiciliary services needed as we transition to a right care at the right time in the right setting, often at home."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00453,2023-05-10-T-017,453,Deputy Speaker,"Ms Ang, you are at 19 minutes 40 seconds."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00454,2023-05-10-T-017,454,Janet Ang,"Sorry. Okay. Who will be responsible for recruiting, training and managing all of them? Perhaps, some form of uberised certified healthcare professionals who schedule their own rosters and probably work the ""beat"" in their neighbourhood could be the best."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00455,2023-05-10-T-017,455,Janet Ang,"As I conclude, I cannot help but worry about our collective ability to transform at this pace. To rush too much, risks the effort being channelled to the superficial, resulting in us getting the form and losing the substance. Change is never going to be easy. We are blessed to have a healthcare system that is amongst the best in the world. The latest Legatum Prosperity Index 2023 ranked Singapore in number one position with a health index score of 86.9."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00456,2023-05-10-T-017,456,Janet Ang,"I would like to close by paying tribute to everyone involved with the healthcare ecosystem  the cleaners, care support staff, allied healthcare professionals, nurses, doctors, medical professionals and healthcare administrators. To all of you in and around healthcare, to quote Pope Francis, ""Compassion is the heart of what you do. You know that it is not just about good organisation but a heart of all that is listening, accompanying and supporting the people under your care."""
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00457,2023-05-10-T-017,457,Janet Ang,"It is not an easy job but for most of you, it is a vocation. So, a big thank you for your tireless efforts and contributions to keeping Singapore and Singaporeans health aware, ready, inclusive, resilient and dignified through every stage of our lives. Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00458,2023-05-10-T-017,458,Deputy Speaker,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00459,2023-05-10-T-017,459,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, the Tripartite Workgroup for the Prevention of Abuse and Harassment of Healthcare Workers was set up in April 2022 to look at how to address the abuse and harassment of healthcare workers. The work group presented its findings and recommendations in March this year. Their findings on the extent of abuse is troubling. More than two in three healthcare workers had witnesses or experienced abuse or harassment in the past year. A third of all healthcare workers had witnessed or experienced abuse or harassment at least once a week."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00460,2023-05-10-T-017,460,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Healthcare workers are in a particularly vulnerable position. Their job inherently involves interaction with people who are in need of some form of assistance or attention, or whom may even be in distress. Many healthcare workers therefore internalise that some abuse is to be expected as they carry out their jobs and this often leads to under-reporting."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00461,2023-05-10-T-017,461,Raj Joshua Thomas,"The work group found that that frontline healthcare workers like pharmacists, patient service associates and nurses are more likely to face abuse and harassment, with the most common type of abuse being shouting, making demeaning comments and threatening to file complaints or to take legal action against the healthcare workers. In other words, many of these forms of abuse and harassment arise out of an expectation that the patient and/or the caregiver should be treated in a certain way, that they may have some entitlements that they are not getting or that they should have some level of service or timeliness."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00462,2023-05-10-T-017,462,Raj Joshua Thomas,"This prevalence of abuse against frontline service workers has also been found in other sectors. The critical question, therefore, is why do these abusers have these expectations and why do they think they think they can resort to shouting, making demeaning remarks or threatening to make complaints?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00463,2023-05-10-T-017,463,Raj Joshua Thomas,I wonder whether it is precisely because of the fact that our healthcare system is reputed to be one of the best in the world and whether it has something to do with the quintessential Singaporean aspiration towards efficiency and accountability. Has this now become so ingrained in our people that it has become a basic expectation of all services and workers in Singapore?
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00464,2023-05-10-T-017,464,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Then, when this expectation is not met, Singaporeans become frustrated as they feel that the system has failed them. In this regard, our success at being efficient and productive may have turned out to be a double-edged sword, because even falling slightly short can lead to backlash."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00465,2023-05-10-T-017,465,Raj Joshua Thomas,"One thing that stood out for me in the report was that one of the more prevalent types of abuse was threatening to file complaints or to take legal action against the worker. Again, this appears to be an aberrant, twisted application of the whistle-blowing process, the desire to improve through feedback as well as the rule of law. Are we becoming more litigious as a society and is it happening because we believe that any perceived slight or inconvenience can be remedied by litigation by complaining or through the courts? All these affect the morale of the healthcare workforce and their ability to carry out their jobs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00466,2023-05-10-T-017,466,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Just this morning, Dr Tan Yia Swam shared with me an anecdote of how one of her friends in healthcare was so affected by threats that she had resigned. This included the threat from an abusive individual who threatened to look for her outside her workplace."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00467,2023-05-10-T-017,467,Raj Joshua Thomas,"He said – he said it in Mandarin, which I shall not try to say verbatim, but the translation of it is, ""Singapore is so small. Even mouse also can find."" This is what I was told the translation is."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00468,2023-05-10-T-017,468,Raj Joshua Thomas,"When it comes down to our workers on the ground, what they are focused on is getting their job done. Technology and processes have made us faster and better but there are also sometimes administrative processes that workers have to follow."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00469,2023-05-10-T-017,469,Raj Joshua Thomas,"For example, the Personal Data Protection Act now imposes certain requirements on data collection and processing that are necessary to protect personally identifying information."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00470,2023-05-10-T-017,470,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Another example is that as our population ages, there will be an increasing need to appoint deputies. There are certain statutory procedures that must be complied with that caregivers may not fully understand. This could lead to frustration with hospital administrators and tempers could flare."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00471,2023-05-10-T-017,471,Raj Joshua Thomas,"As such, a key plank of the effort to prevent abuse and protect our healthcare workers should be to instill in patients, caregivers and members of the public that regardless of their frustration with administrative processes or perceived systematic inefficiencies, it is not acceptable to take out these frustrations on the workers who are merely working within the system that they find themselves."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00472,2023-05-10-T-017,472,Raj Joshua Thomas,"This goes beyond having mere statutory protections and penalties under the law. It requires that we adopt a societal mindset of civility and kindness instead of imperious expectation and entitlement. In fact, this is what the hon Member Dr Wan Rizal said earlier – that we need to have an all-of-society effort."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00473,2023-05-10-T-017,473,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Japan, for example, has a culture of omotenashi, or selfless hospitality, which is seen as a microcosm of the Japanese mindset to be centred on care rather than expectation. Omotenashi provides that good manners and a polite bearing are not just expected in interactions between individuals in social contexts but that they are also indications of respectability and good standing. Principles include humility, patience, a quickness to apologise and an even tone in conversation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00474,2023-05-10-T-017,474,Raj Joshua Thomas,"To emphasise omotenashi and ensure that this core Japanese characteristic is not lost amidst a modernising society, the Tokyo municipal government launched the Tokyo Good Manners Project in 2016, which is ongoing."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00475,2023-05-10-T-017,475,Raj Joshua Thomas,"MOH Holdings had already announced that it would be launching a national public education campaign to promote positive relationships of trust and respect between healthcare workers, patients and their caregivers. I truly hope that this campaign will be successful in reducing incidents of abuse, giving societal support to our healthcare workers and building our very own omotenashi."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00476,2023-05-10-T-017,476,Raj Joshua Thomas,Abuse of healthcare workers comes generally from two categories of individuals – patients and caregivers or family members of patients.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00477,2023-05-10-T-017,477,Raj Joshua Thomas,"As regards patients, healthcare professionals may find themselves in a conundrum. Patients who are elderly, have mental health issues or who are in pain may sometimes turn abusive, including physically abusive."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00478,2023-05-10-T-017,478,Raj Joshua Thomas,"In this regard, one of the work group's recommendations was to stipulate clear consequences for perpetrators. For patients who are abusive, warnings may be issued and they may be discharged if they do not require urgent attention. Further to this, healthcare workers may also disengage from abusive patients by refusing unreasonable requests."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00479,2023-05-10-T-017,479,Raj Joshua Thomas,"I imagine that it will be challenging drafting the guidelines for this as it would have to balance the need to provide medical care to patients while, at the same time, protecting healthcare workers from physical, mental and emotional abuse."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00480,2023-05-10-T-017,480,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Likewise, for caregivers and family members who may be distraught due to a medical emergency or condition of their loved one, there may also be instances where they turn abusive."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00481,2023-05-10-T-017,481,Raj Joshua Thomas,"My view is that while we can be sympathetic to family members in such situations, there should be zero tolerance if they turn verbally or physically abusive or harass healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00482,2023-05-10-T-017,482,Raj Joshua Thomas,"While it is a part of the healthcare worker's role to provide support to these people, there is no overriding obligation of providing medical care to them. As such, the procedures to deal with abusive non-patients should be far stricter than those for abusive patients and should be actively enforced."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00483,2023-05-10-T-017,483,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Supervisors and hospital management must stand by their workers. Our national healthcare groups have already said that they will support and implement the recommendations, including a zero-tolerance policy. I was also heartened that Minister Ong has said that even the Minister will have their back and that healthcare workers should know this."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00484,2023-05-10-T-017,484,Raj Joshua Thomas,Authorities should also be prepared to prosecute such cases of abuse if they are beyond a certain threshold of severity.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00485,2023-05-10-T-017,485,Raj Joshua Thomas,I hope that the guidelines that will be issued in the second half of this year will see a sharp reduction in incidence of abuse against our healthcare workers and that it will give them peace of mind as they go to work every day.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00486,2023-05-10-T-017,486,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, I support the Motion raised by my fellow Nominated Members. I would also like to take this opportunity to support our healthcare workers and to thank them for all of the sacrifices that they have made and continue to make every day."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00487,2023-05-10-T-017,487,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Our nurses, doctors, therapists, ah mahs, counsellors, pharmacists and administrators are in vocations that protect what is central to humankind – life and well-being. Theirs are not merely noble professions but the noblest of all professions. Let us therefore ensure that we do our very best to take care of them – that we take care of those who take care of us."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00488,2023-05-10-T-017,488,Deputy Speaker,Prof Hoon.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00489,2023-05-10-T-017,489,Hoon Hian Teck,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at a fundamental level, we all recognise that there are some negative events in an individual's life that are unforeseen, such as falling seriously ill."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00490,2023-05-10-T-017,490,Hoon Hian Teck,"To provide protection to its citizens against such contingent events, one might think that we could rely solely on private insurance companies. The argument is that risk-averse individuals would find it in their self-interest to purchase insurance policies that are offered at actuarially fair prices."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00491,2023-05-10-T-017,491,Hoon Hian Teck,"However, because of asymmetric information, one side of the market has private information not readily available to the other side, leading to adverse selection."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00492,2023-05-10-T-017,492,Hoon Hian Teck,"Full insurance is generally not available. In a market that is characterised by adverse selection, more-costly-to-serve customers know who they are but sellers do not. The insurance company knows that among the potential pool of customers, some individuals are better risks than others but it does not know who the better risks are."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00493,2023-05-10-T-017,493,Hoon Hian Teck,"The fact that insured individuals know their own risk level better than the insurer might cause those who are more likely to have an adverse health outcome to purchase an insurance policy, thus leading the insurer to lose money if it offers insurance. The result is that there is an inadequate provision of private insurance."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00494,2023-05-10-T-017,494,Hoon Hian Teck,"Thus, in the presence of an adverse selection problem, there is a role for the Government to intervene by providing social insurance in the form of MediShield Life, which was introduced in November 2015. This national health insurance scheme has three important features."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00495,2023-05-10-T-017,495,Hoon Hian Teck,"First, there is a public mandate so that all Singapore citizens and permanent residents are included in the scheme. Absent such a mandate, more healthy residents would have an incentive to opt out of buying coverage at a premium that reflects the much higher healthcare costs of less healthy residents."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00496,2023-05-10-T-017,496,Hoon Hian Teck,"Second, pre-existing medical conditions are covered, although there are additional premiums for serious pre-existing medical conditions that require intensive medical intervention to treat or require prolonged treatment."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00497,2023-05-10-T-017,497,Hoon Hian Teck,"Third, the Government provides subsidies to low-income residents to help them make their premium payments."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00498,2023-05-10-T-017,498,Hoon Hian Teck,"MediShield Life is administered by the CPF Board, which is a defined contribution social security system. In contrast to a defined benefit social security system where payroll taxes are collected from the working young to finance the benefits received by the retired old, CPF contributions form part of an individual's savings."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00499,2023-05-10-T-017,499,Hoon Hian Teck,"In order for our national health insurance scheme to be financially sustainable, it is vital that the economy continues to generate good jobs. This is because the main source of financing the premium payments comes from an individual's MediSave Account."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00500,2023-05-10-T-017,500,Hoon Hian Teck,The Motion's call for a whole-of-Government approach is therefore very appropriate.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00501,2023-05-10-T-017,501,Hoon Hian Teck,The recent recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Platform Workers for platform companies to work with the Government to develop a mechanism for platform workers to make regular contributions to MediSave is also timely as it contributes to a financially sustainable national health insurance scheme.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00502,2023-05-10-T-017,502,Hoon Hian Teck,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I therefore support the Motion standing in the names of my three hon fellow NMPs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00503,2023-05-10-T-017,503,Deputy Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00504,2023-05-10-T-017,504,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today's Motion has raised some salient issues. I would like to speak on ageing issues and explore ways in which we can better empower our seniors to continue to lead fulfilling lives."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00505,2023-05-10-T-017,505,Yip Hon Weng,It is imperative that our healthcare system is equipped to handle the unique challenges that comes with a super aged society. We have to be forward-looking and address the issues now or we risk seeing our infrastructure and facilities unable to cope with demands. This will impose a significant fiscal burden on Singapore in the future. I would like to speak on three issues.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00506,2023-05-10-T-017,506,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need to better organise care integration. I agree with Dr Tan Yia Swam that greater cross-collaboration is necessary but I wish to add that this is particularly pertinent between health and social care, which falls under the purview of MOH (MOH) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) respectively."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00507,2023-05-10-T-017,507,Yip Hon Weng,"The Healthier SG initiative is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. We want health, not healthcare. Social prescription is a key component in this. We need to encourage our seniors to engage in activities that promote their overall health. There are plenty of free exercise and wellness programmes to do. This is made available by Sport Singapore, PA and various social service agencies (SSAs), but we must rally the ground-up support and get active participation. What is being done in this respect to link up the two sides? Otherwise, it is just another startup project – good for sound bites but may be ineffective in helping our residents."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00508,2023-05-10-T-017,508,Yip Hon Weng,"Social prescription and healthcare must go hand in hand. There needs to be greater integration between health and social care. Do healthcare professionals, including general practitioners (GPs) and their clinic assistants, know what kinds or types of exercise programmes exist or are provided by various organisations in the neighbourhood? If so, are they knowledgeable enough to recommend them to their patients? Similarly, do our social service professionals know how to identify health-related issues in seniors and refer them to the appropriate healthcare professionals?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00509,2023-05-10-T-017,509,Yip Hon Weng,"A concept may look promising on paper, but the devil is always in implementation. How do we help prepare healthcare staff outside of MOH who are to be part of this project? We need to move away from the fear of over-medicalising healthcare and encourage greater collaboration between health and social care."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00510,2023-05-10-T-017,510,Yip Hon Weng,"Is it time to move away from an interagency ministerial committee and consider establishing a Ministry of Ageing? Organisation drives behaviour. A dedicated ministry can spearhead integrated policies relating to ageing, ensure that the needs of our seniors are met and make Singapore a great place to age in."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00511,2023-05-10-T-017,511,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need better enablers to support care integration. It is essential that we have an integrated system that allows for seamless collaboration between health and social care. To achieve this we need to address the current issue of healthcare legacy IT as well as IT systems being used by different clusters. I mentioned about this in my previous Parliamentary speeches and during the Committee of Supply debate."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00512,2023-05-10-T-017,512,Yip Hon Weng,"For example, some clusters use Health Buddy where others use HealthHub. There are also a myriad of different computer systems across community, primary and tertiary healthcare providers, ranging from CCMS, Epic to Citrix. Can the systems inter-operate? Can we merge these IT systems to ensure that healthcare professionals have access to a unified platform to manage their patients' healthcare needs?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00513,2023-05-10-T-017,513,Yip Hon Weng,"The same applies to merging GovTech systems and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), ensuring that we have better data sharing between health and social sectors."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00514,2023-05-10-T-017,514,Yip Hon Weng,"We must also explore ways to better enable data sharing between Government and SSAs on information regarding the wellness of seniors, both from the health and social sectors. Currently, data sharing seems rather fragmented. We should strive for a holistic view of the senior, encompassing both health and social aspects."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00515,2023-05-10-T-017,515,Yip Hon Weng,"Finally, we must explore ways to leverage telehealth to facilitate care integration. What are the plans to scale up current pilots? How can we ensure that telehealth is utilised effectively to provide comprehensive care for our seniors?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00516,2023-05-10-T-017,516,Yip Hon Weng,"Third, as we seek to improve care integration for seniors. We must also focus on further empowerment for care integration. One critical question that we must ask is this  can we better empower our seniors to better take care of themselves?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00517,2023-05-10-T-017,517,Yip Hon Weng,"To answer this question, we need to explore key messages and initiatives that seniors should look out for as they age."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00518,2023-05-10-T-017,518,Yip Hon Weng,One possible solution is to provide seniors and caregivers with a health booklet containing relevant information to help them manage their health effectively. This is similar to the child health booklet provided to primary school students and their parents.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00519,2023-05-10-T-017,519,Yip Hon Weng,"While we acknowledge this may not be feasible for those who are illiterate or have visual disabilities, it will still be a useful tool for many seniors and caregivers who need guidance."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00520,2023-05-10-T-017,520,Yip Hon Weng,"In fact, as our aged population becomes increasingly educated and literate in years to come, we expect much of this empowerment to require self-help and initiation on the part of our seniors. Seniors would want to be empowered to make independent and informed decisions. We need to nudge them in the right direction. A key move is to promote better transparency, push out more information on various health related topics, such as the cancer CDL list and insurance."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00521,2023-05-10-T-017,521,Yip Hon Weng,"In this regard, we should explore ways that the Silver Generation Office can help in this area. By providing seniors with the necessary information and resources, we can enable them to take better care of their health and well-being. Ultimately, this will lead to better health outcomes and greater independence for our seniors."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00522,2023-05-10-T-017,522,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need to transform the way we deliver care for our aged population. We need integration not fragmentation. But what does a truly integrated system look like?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00523,2023-05-10-T-017,523,Yip Hon Weng,"For me, it is a system where there will be a seamless integration of care services organised around the senior, with a 360 view of his physical, mental and emotional health."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00524,2023-05-10-T-017,524,Yip Hon Weng,"How can we achieve this? This will require drawing up care in a seamless manner across settings between acute and long-term care, between acute and primary care and between primary and care in the community."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00525,2023-05-10-T-017,525,Yip Hon Weng,"It would mean adopting a multidisciplinary and person-centric approach. It entails doctors working closely with other health and social care professionals such as Allied Health Officers, social workers and even community befrienders to identify the common care needs for seniors and to offer integrated interventions. Health and social care must transcend boundaries to help seniors to age well in the community. It will also mean that information should flow seamlessly between hospitals to care professionals in the community to better manage seniors health and social conditions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00526,2023-05-10-T-017,526,Yip Hon Weng,"The eventual end state would be one patient, one health record or wellness record, one IT system and hopefully all these overseen by one Ministry of Ageing, to deliver coordinated holistic and integrated care to transform Singapore into the best place to live in. I support the Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00527,2023-05-10-T-017,527,Deputy Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.40 pm.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00528,2023-05-10-T-017,528,Deputy Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00529,2023-05-10-T-017,529,Deputy Speaker,at 3.22 pm until 3.40 pm.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00530,2023-05-10-T-017,530,Deputy Speaker,Sitting resumed at 3.40 pm.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00531,2023-05-10-T-017,531,Deputy Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00532,2023-05-10-T-017,532,Deputy Speaker,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00533,2023-05-10-T-017,533,Eric Chua,"Sir, I agree with hon Members that supporting healthcare beyond the COVID-19 pandemic takes a collective effort by Singapore society."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00534,2023-05-10-T-017,534,Eric Chua,"Sir, in preparing for this speech, I asked ChatGPT what it thought of the Singapore healthcare system. Minister Ong Ye Kung and the MOH team would be glad to note that ChatGPT’s reply to me was, and I quote, “The Singapore healthcare system is often cited as one of the best healthcare systems in the world, known for its efficiency, high quality care and low healthcare costs.”"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00535,2023-05-10-T-017,535,Eric Chua,"That said, one cannot assume that this somewhat glowing review will remain status quo. Singapore is one of the fastest-ageing societies globally. We know the numbers very well  one in four Singaporeans a senior by 2030, and every other Singaporean a senior by 2050."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00536,2023-05-10-T-017,536,Eric Chua,"If we are to reap the full harvest of meaningful and productive longevity, we must strive to close the glaring decade-long gap between health-span and lifespan. This is important, and I thought I ought to repeat this. If we want Singaporeans to not just live longer, but to live longer and better, we have a good 10-year health- and lifespan gap to close. And in the longer run, we must capitalise on the upsides of ageing."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00537,2023-05-10-T-017,537,Eric Chua,"In 2017, Sport Singapore (SportSG) launched the Active Health national initiative to inspire Singaporeans to take ownership of their own health and well-being, and to foster greater community spirit through shared experiences. We wanted to nudge a mindset shift from one which is “deficit-focused”, that is, “I seek treatment only when I’m unwell”, to an “aspiration-focused” model of active, healthy living. In the latter model, everyone is empowered to live better, and to delay, or prevent the onset of chronic diseases."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00538,2023-05-10-T-017,538,Eric Chua,"Over the past decade, SportSG has been vigorously implementing the Vision 2030 recommendations. As such, national regular sports participation has risen by some 20%, from 54% in 2015 to 74% in 2022, last year. In an Active Health survey conducted in 2022, about 96% of the respondents gave a score of eight out of 10 when asked about the importance of health and wellness. Yet, only 60% said they are confident of improving and/or maintaining their own health and wellness. Many are unaware of their own health status and how they can easily take a small step towards an active, healthier lifestyle."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00539,2023-05-10-T-017,539,Eric Chua,I agree with Members that support is needed from all sectors of Singapore society to ensure that everyone can realise their health and wellness aspirations.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00540,2023-05-10-T-017,540,Eric Chua,"One such concerted effort is the Queenstown Health District pilot. Spearheaded by HDB, National University of Singapore (NUS) and the National University Health System (NUHS), the Health District seeks to increase healthy longevity and intergenerational bonding through the provision of health and wellness programmes for people of all ages."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00541,2023-05-10-T-017,541,Eric Chua,"In Queenstown, facilitated by the Lion Befrienders, seniors participate in strength and balancing programmes, such as dance fitness, modified sports and virtual square-stepping exercise. Seniors also take part in intergenerational sporting Friday activities, such as football, active-farming and dance fitness, designed for participants of all ages."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00542,2023-05-10-T-017,542,Eric Chua,"Students take part in an Active Health Classroom Champions programme that adopts a holistic approach to their health and promotes the participation of sport and physical activity beyond curriculum hours. Under SportSG’s school sports partnership scheme, schools in Queenstown have introduced more multi-sport programmes to promote general health and well-being and social cohesion amongst students."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00543,2023-05-10-T-017,543,Eric Chua,"Families take part in workshops and programmes, such as Active Health Discovery Walk in the Park, which emphasises, for instance, the importance of resistance exercises in increasing muscle mass as they go for their regular walks."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00544,2023-05-10-T-017,544,Eric Chua,"There are also programmes catered for the vulnerable and persons with disabilities. For instance, the SportCares FUN Starters multi-sport and Saturday Night Lights football programmes provide children and youth living in rental housing and other vulnerable communities, the opportunity to play and develop a lifelong habit in sports, improve fundamental movement skills and physical fitness as well as to instil a sense of belonging with the community."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00545,2023-05-10-T-017,545,Eric Chua,"Besides programming, SportSG collaborates with HDB to enhance infrastructure within the Queenstown Health District to enable residents to keep fit and to stay active. For example, an ""Active Health Fitness Trail"" with behavioural nudges designed by SportSG to develop strength, flexibility and balance as well as appropriate fitness equipment will be installed as part of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) to enhance the fitness and exercise spaces around the Mei Ling precinct in Queenstown."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00546,2023-05-10-T-017,546,Eric Chua,"Beyond the Health District, we have today set up some eight Active Health Labs island wide, at our ActiveSG sport centres and Active Health partner premises. Our objective is to enable people to understand their body composition, fitness and health status, and to learn tips from qualified Active Health Coaches on how to sustain an active and healthy lifestyle."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00547,2023-05-10-T-017,547,Eric Chua,"Residents come to our ActiveSG centres not just to do their workouts, but also to connect and to network. Based on the 2022 National Sports Participation Survey, when participating with others, 95% of respondents indicated that their well-being has improved through sport and physical activity; and 94% of respondents indicated participation in physical activity has improved their quality of life."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00548,2023-05-10-T-017,548,Eric Chua,"Just last weekend, I joined hundreds of Queenstown residents as we bade a temporary farewell to our beloved Queenstown Sport Centre. The facility has served our residents very well for more than five decades, and has played host to decentralised National Day Parades, that was in the seventies, and was home to the Tanjong Pagar United Football Club and our National Water Polo team in the earlier days. Indeed, sport and our sporting facilities also plays a critical role in place-making and the formation of a common identity."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00549,2023-05-10-T-017,549,Eric Chua,"I would, therefore, like to call upon everyone to head down to our ActiveSG sport centres located island-wide, try out the various programs and activities, and to visit our Active Health Labs to kickstart your health and wellness journey today."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00550,2023-05-10-T-017,550,Eric Chua,"Beyond physical activity, SportSG will continue to work with MOH and HPB to engage general practitioners (GPs) to refer clients to suitable community-based activities that can help them improve or maintain their health, as well as understand their fitness and health status. To do this well, we need to work as a team."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00551,2023-05-10-T-017,551,Eric Chua,"Individual citizens can take the initiative to make a trip to the Active Health Labs, learn more about their own health and wellness, and consider working relevant fitness and dietary advice into their everyday lives. Family members, too, can play a part by gently nudging loved ones to take the first step to taking charge of their own health and fitness by making the trip to the Active Health Labs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00552,2023-05-10-T-017,552,Eric Chua,"Healthcare providers, on the other hand, can refer their clients to the Active Health Labs, to learn how to exercise safely with guidance from accredited training coaches. On the Government's end, SportSG will work with HPB and PA to ensure a steady pipeline of programmes, sport interest groups and social activities that healthcare providers can connect their clients to. Sir, in Mandarin, please."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00553,2023-05-10-T-017,553,Eric Chua,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Singapore is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world. Of course, we hope that Singaporeans can live long, but at the same time, we also hope that they can live healthily and meaningfully in their golden years."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00554,2023-05-10-T-017,554,Eric Chua,"SportSG launched the Active Health initiative in 2017 to inspire Singaporeans to take ownership of their own health, and to foster greater community spirit. In order to achieve this, all stakeholders in our society will have to play a role. The Queenstown Healthcare District pilot is a good example."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00555,2023-05-10-T-017,555,Eric Chua,"In addition, we have set up eight Active Health Labs island-wide, at our ActiveSG sport centres and Active Health partner premises. Our aim is to enable people to understand their own body composition and health status, and to learn from qualified Active Health Coaches on how to sustain a healthy lifestyle."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00556,2023-05-10-T-017,556,Eric Chua,"I would like to call on everyone to head down to our ActiveSG sports centres located island-wide, try out the various programs and activities that we have organised for you, and visit our Active Health Labs to kickstart your health and wellness journey!"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00557,2023-05-10-T-017,557,Eric Chua,"(In English)  Sir, it is heartening to note that many recognise the importance of health and wellness. Through Active Health, we hope to enable happier and healthier residents where they can live longer and flourish in ""pro-social"" spaces – where the young and old care for and nudge one another towards active living and healthy, purposeful longevity. Sir, I support the Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00558,2023-05-10-T-017,558,Deputy Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. You have a request?
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00559,2023-05-10-T-017,559,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to participate in this debate."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00560,2023-05-10-T-017,560,Deputy Speaker,"Before you do, I just like to point out that it is a last-minute request and to allow for better scheduling of Parliament Sittings, I would encourage all Members to continue to give us advance notice if they intend to participate in Parliamentary debates. This helps with the timetabling and the scheduling. I seek Members' cooperation in this regard. I now call on you to give your speech, you may deliver it."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00561,2023-05-10-T-017,561,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to participate in this debate. I will speak about the steps we can take as a nation towards moving to a better balance in our expenditure on healthcare resources. I will share some details on why I think we can increase the carrying capacity of our healthcare system, perhaps, to some detriment in efficiency and some marginal pressure in costs that will pay off, I believe, in terms of greater long-term resilience."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00562,2023-05-10-T-017,562,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As others in this House have shared, and is well understood by this Government, our impending public expenditures on medical care would be substantially greater than what we have currently allocated for spending today. This is due predominantly to societal ageing and greater healthcare needs associated with the more elderly population. But my point is more fundamental. It is that, even at present, our healthcare system falls somewhat short of what we might reasonably expect for an economy at our stage of development."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00563,2023-05-10-T-017,563,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To be clear, I am not suggesting that our current system is fundamentally flawed, nor am I saying that it should be completely overhauled. Indeed, I believe that we can justifiably be proud of the quality of care delivered by our existing system, which blends public as well as private components, and has proven to be remarkably cost-efficient in doing so, as Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua has just shared with this House."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00564,2023-05-10-T-017,564,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While I certainly prefer the balance to be tilted more toward a larger public share – a matter on which I had spoken about before, in the context of the debate on the amendments to the Healthcare Services Act in March this year – that is not the focus of my concerns today."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00565,2023-05-10-T-017,565,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Rather, I wish to highlight what I believe is one glaring shortcoming that was raised by the COVID-19 episode  because we run our systems so lean, it has become fragile in the face of large, unanticipated, albeit, fully predictable shocks, such as the pandemic."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00566,2023-05-10-T-017,566,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Here, a little philosophical discussion may, perhaps, be in order. The bread and butter function of economists is to maximise a given objective, subject to constraints. This, generally, means that we are constantly looking for optimal solutions and we are very happy when we find such solutions. My wife often makes fun of me, about how I gain enormous satisfaction by planning my visit to the grocery store along with all my other errands – pumping gas, drawing cash, ""dabao"" dinner – so that I can make one smooth, continuous trip. In this regard, economists are easily satisfied creatures."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00567,2023-05-10-T-017,567,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But there is another, equally tenable, worldview and that is one often held by engineers. Engineers do not look to wholly strip systems of inefficiencies. They recognise that redundancies are important, because while under normal conditions, such under-utilised elements may seem wasteful, they are mission-critical and can prevent the entire failure of the system during times of undue stress. Accordingly, they build bridges that can bear far more weight than one might expect with normal traffic – and then add a little more. They design planes that can run with one engine, even when the other stops. They design power plants that can possess multiple fail-safes, so that they can keep the whole thing running while a compromised part is being repaired."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00568,2023-05-10-T-017,568,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, the number of intensive care units (ICU) beds in Singapore, per 100,000 of our population, currently stands at 5.7. The average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an association of industrialised nations, is closer to a dozen, twice our number. Of the four economies that have a lower coverage than we do, only one, Japan, has a significantly larger elderly share in its population."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00569,2023-05-10-T-017,569,Jamus Jerome Lim,"More generally, our hospital bed count is also low. We maintain a little more than two beds per 1,000 of our population, a fraction of that of other East Asian economies, like Japan and South Korea which have around a dozen; China, which has around five; and other advanced economies like Denmark, the Netherlands, Israel and the United States, where the ratio is closer to three."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00570,2023-05-10-T-017,570,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To be clear, this low bed count is not prima facie evidence that there is a problem with the present system. We need to look at the occupancy of said beds, and one could even make the argument that efficient recovery means that we are able to sustain a lower carrying capacity."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00571,2023-05-10-T-017,571,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In a response to a Parliamentary Question filed last year by my hon friend Mr Leon Perera, Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary shared that the target bed occupancy rate over the next five years was around 80%, which he added was generally recommended by academic communities as well as healthcare authorities. And in a statement to this House the year prior, he also explained that we have been able to ramp up ICU beds very quickly, as we did during the pandemic."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00572,2023-05-10-T-017,572,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But in that statement, he also acknowledged the need to ramp up ICU bed capacity, although he qualified this by pointing out that this process was non-trivial, being limited, principally, by the need to increase the medical personnel required to staff such beds."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00573,2023-05-10-T-017,573,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Moreover, recent data on bed occupancy rates at our major hospitals reveal that this 80% appears to be systematically breached, and over the past month, the rate has routinely exceeded even 90% in Tan Tock Seng, Ng Teng Fong and Khoo Teck Puat hospitals. And that is under non-pandemic conditions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00574,2023-05-10-T-017,574,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Taken together, these suggest that the Government is both aware that running our medical infrastructure too lean can come back to bite us during periods of stress, and that we have yet to fully address this problem even though we are back in normal times."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00575,2023-05-10-T-017,575,Jamus Jerome Lim,"MOH has shared that it plans to roll out a new health campus in Woodlands, as well as another in Bedok, but the remaining projects are all expansions of current facilities. Will the Minister be willing to share if these will be sufficient to cater, to not just anticipated increases in demand due to an aging population, but also relieve some of the existing capacity constraints faced? Or will they be mainly focused on matching resources with new incoming demand, leaving current capacity largely unaltered?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00576,2023-05-10-T-017,576,Jamus Jerome Lim,This brings us to what appears to be the key constraint  medical manpower.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00577,2023-05-10-T-017,577,Jamus Jerome Lim,"At present, we also have a comparatively low coverage of doctors and nurses. As of 2021, Singapore has 2.7 physicians per 1,000 people, around two-thirds the OECD average of 3.8."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00578,2023-05-10-T-017,578,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Unsurprisingly, this has led to burn-out, stress and high turnover among our medical professionals, which others in this House have articulated. The solution appears straightforward and is uncontentious  we need to increase our supply of medical personnel. The Government has stressed the same, that ramping up medically-trained staff is a priority. The question then, is how."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00579,2023-05-10-T-017,579,Jamus Jerome Lim,"There is a global nurse shortage which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates may be close to six million and the International Council of Nurses – to be fair, an interested party – places this at a higher number of around 13 million."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00580,2023-05-10-T-017,580,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Given this context, increasing supply calls for us to attract as well as retain global talent in the short term while looking for ways to expand domestically trained workers in the longer term."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00581,2023-05-10-T-017,581,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The practical manifestation of our limited beds and doctors is that wait times for admission to a ward has remained elevated at many facilities. This has been most chronic at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, although we have seen spikes at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital as well as Sengkang General Hospital, which is located in the constituency that I represent. On certain days, this could lead to waits even exceeding 24 hours."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00582,2023-05-10-T-017,582,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The question we should ask ourselves is this  are we willing to accept the status quo where our patients may occasionally need to wait for more than a day to be admitted to a hospital? Perhaps, we think that this is a reasonable trade-off to keep overall medical costs down or we may use this fact as symptomatic of a need to increase the carrying capacity of the present system."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00583,2023-05-10-T-017,583,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In my earlier speech, I offered some medium-term suggestions for how we could relieve some of the existing pressure on our system. We could consider increasing the number of recognised universities for basic medical degrees, up from the present 100. For experienced doctors who have a long track record of working in other jurisdictions, we can simplify the application and accreditation process, perhaps, with designated processes based at MOH that would seek out such doctors and encourage them to apply."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00584,2023-05-10-T-017,584,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As we compete for global nursing talent with other advanced economies, many of whom are facing their own nursing shortages, it also makes sense to train more of our homegrown workforce to take this on. We could offer more generous terms for trainees. We could fully waive course fees, for instance, which, to be fair, is already relatively modest, on the condition that these trainees also work as nurses in Singapore for a certain duration after graduation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00585,2023-05-10-T-017,585,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This could also apply to those who would consider a mid-career switch. We can ensure that SkillsFuture funds not only fully cover conversion courses but also perhaps provide more credit for prior training. For example, early childhood educators and teachers surely would satisfy general courses in communications, critical thinking, data analysis and behavioural science, all of which are part of the nursing curriculum today."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00586,2023-05-10-T-017,586,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Easing the supply pressure will require that we go beyond policies on the quantity dimension. We could also work on price. At the simplest, this means that salaries in the field should rise. One existing limitation to more sustained increases in wages is that costs are already high. This, in turn, seems to be led by commercial rental rates for private hospitals, which can spill over into public pricing. The high rent is a function of – well, you guessed it – elevated land pricing."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00587,2023-05-10-T-017,587,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But it is not simply about higher wages – if these are simultaneously accompanied by longer hours. If anything, it would be better to increase the total number of doctors and nurses while keeping hours sane. The total wage bill will remain the same but the quality of care is likely to improve."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00588,2023-05-10-T-017,588,Jamus Jerome Lim,"We could also increase the number of tiers within nursing – the number is as many as five or six in other countries – from our present three of enrolled, registered and advanced practice nurses. This offers additional upward mobility pathways, making the profession more attractive for those contemplating entry."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00589,2023-05-10-T-017,589,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, as I explained at the outset, our healthcare system capacity does not appear to be fundamentally flawed but it is facing increasing pressure. It is wise to adjust and adapt to impending needs at a time of relative calm rather than feel the need to ""kelam-kabut"" to make up for these during a future pandemic scenario."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00590,2023-05-10-T-017,590,Deputy Speaker,Minister of State Gan Siow Huang.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00591,2023-05-10-T-017,591,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Deputy Speaker, health is wealth. Our own health account is like a bank account. The more we put in it, the more we can get out of it. Investing in your health now will pay dividends for the rest of your life."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00592,2023-05-10-T-017,592,Gan Siow Huang,Most of us would agree that our children need to start healthy living habits from young and consistently practise healthy living in order to have the best chance of staying healthy and living life to the fullest.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00593,2023-05-10-T-017,593,Gan Siow Huang,"I thank Dr Tan Yia Swam for highlighting the importance of health education. MOE takes a holistic approach towards promoting the overall well-being and health of our students from the time they start going to school. Throughout their educational journey, students acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes to cultivate an active and healthy lifestyle and maintain it beyond their schooling years."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00594,2023-05-10-T-017,594,Gan Siow Huang,"At the preschool stage, MOE's Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework emphasises holistic development by encouraging healthy habits and a positive attitude towards participating in physical activities."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00595,2023-05-10-T-017,595,Gan Siow Huang,"In schools, students learn about good health practices, such as regular exercise, sufficient sleep and healthy eating. During Physical Education (PE) lessons, they learn to play a variety of sports and games that equip them to participate in physical activities well into adulthood. Our polytechnics have various health and wellness modules for our students while ITE has weekly PE curriculum."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00596,2023-05-10-T-017,596,Gan Siow Huang,MOE schools and our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) also provide opportunities for students to be physically active outside formal curriculum hours. Students can take part in Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and join interest groups or sports clubs. They can make use of sports facilities and equipment in schools and on campus to remain physically active.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00597,2023-05-10-T-017,597,Gan Siow Huang,"HPB works with schools and IHLs that wish to adopt programmes, such as the Active Youth Programme, to increase physical activity participation through regular contemporary workout sessions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00598,2023-05-10-T-017,598,Gan Siow Huang,"Nutrition is another critical aspect of physical health. All schools and IHLs actively promote healthy eating. In Food and Consumer Education lessons, lower secondary school students learn to plan and prepare healthier meals to suit their diets. In collaboration with HPB, all schools have implemented the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme, where school canteens provide healthier food and drink options."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00599,2023-05-10-T-017,599,Gan Siow Huang,"Similarly, polytechnics and ITE participate in HPB's Healthier Dining Programme, which encourages food operators to offer healthier choices. The autonomous universities (AUs) also support healthy eating on campus by working with F&B vendors to provide healthier meals to the students."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00600,2023-05-10-T-017,600,Gan Siow Huang,"Next, on mental health. Dr Wan Rizal spoke about the importance of mental health literacy for our students. I agree. Our schools and IHLs equip students with knowledge and skills to strengthen their mental well-being, build resilience and thrive amidst challenges. For example, students learn about common mental health issues and the importance of help-seeking within the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum. As the digital world has an impact on mental health, our students are taught ways to manage their social media use and develop healthy online peer support culture."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00601,2023-05-10-T-017,601,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the health and well-being of our children require a whole-of-society effort. Families and the wider community play an important role in providing an enabling environment to support the adoption of healthy habits. At home, parents can help to reinforce and role model healthy habits. MOE shares practical and actionable tips with parents on building a positive family environment to develop strong physical, social, mental and emotional well-being for their children. These tips are shared with parents via MOE platforms, such as the Parent Kit, MOE Parenting IG and Parents Gateway."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00602,2023-05-10-T-017,602,Gan Siow Huang,"We have heard of positive stories from parents who play an active role to build a healthy lifestyle together with their children and, in doing so, have strengthened parent-child relationship. One father shared with us how he had started a routine to exercise with his child regularly, who had taught him the various types of sports and games that he learnt from PE lessons in school. With parents reinforcing and role modelling what their children are learning in school, I am confident that more children will develop healthy habits for life."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00603,2023-05-10-T-017,603,Gan Siow Huang,"We are heartened to see stakeholders, such as the Parent Support Groups (PSGs), COMPASS which stands for COMmunity and PArents in Support of Schools council, HPB and various social service agencies working in partnership to support parents on ways to strengthen children's health and well-being."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00604,2023-05-10-T-017,604,Gan Siow Huang,"We thank parents and our community partners for working with us to promote the well-being of our students. We look forward to continued and strengthened partnerships with more so that our children can build up their health accounts from young and live their lives to the fullest. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00605,2023-05-10-T-017,605,Deputy Speaker,Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00606,2023-05-10-T-017,606,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in the support of the Motion standing in the name of Dr Tan Yia Swam, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Mr Abdul Samad."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00607,2023-05-10-T-017,607,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, all of us play a key role in ensuring the good health and well-being of the population. As individuals, we need to take active steps to live healthier lives and minimise the risk of falling ill even as the Government builds a supportive environment to help us do this. I will speak about mental health, oral health and the healthcare IT infrastructure and digital tools to support individuals on healthy living."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00608,2023-05-10-T-017,608,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, good mental health is essential. It lies along a spectrum and is multifaceted. Mental health issues can arise from a range of factors, including physical health and social determinants. Addressing these issues will require a collaborative and integrated approach that involves multiple stakeholders from the health, social, education, workplace and community sectors."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00609,2023-05-10-T-017,609,Janil Puthucheary,"This is already happening. For example, under the Community Mental Health Masterplan, MOH, the Agency for Integrated Care and social service agencies have worked together to establish community mental health teams across Singapore. These teams provide mental health education to residents and bring care, such as mental health screening, assessment and therapy, closer to home, where there is less stigma and individuals feel safe to seek help."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00610,2023-05-10-T-017,610,Janil Puthucheary,"Prof Koh Lian Pin spoke about mental health in academic settings. HPB has worked with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to establish peer support structures. Training is provided in empathetic listening and basic mental health first aid skills to support one's peers who show signs of emotional distress. In addition, those who wish to learn about mental health and self-care tips can access MindSG, a portal for mental health and well-being resources that are curated by mental health experts."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00611,2023-05-10-T-017,611,Janil Puthucheary,"It is important to address mental health issues that affect us at the workplace, whether that workplace is an academic setting or otherwise. The Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces was jointly launched in 2020 by MOM, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) to support employees' mental well-being and provide resources for employers, employees and self-employed persons."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00612,2023-05-10-T-017,612,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Tan Yia Swam shared her experience as a junior doctor where there were occasions when she worked for more than 24 hours a day when she was on call.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00613,2023-05-10-T-017,613,Janil Puthucheary,"The Ministry is reviewing the total working hours of junior doctors, including hours worked while on call. The public healthcare clusters have been piloting shorter call hours for junior doctors in selected departments as well as using electronic logging and surveys to monitor junior doctors' working hours."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00614,2023-05-10-T-017,614,Janil Puthucheary,This is a complex subject which requires a fundamental relook at manpower deployment and the sharing of responsibilities between senior and junior doctors. This will take some time to study and work out and we are engaged on this matter.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00615,2023-05-10-T-017,615,Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Tan Yia Swam and Prof Koh Lian Pin shared about the importance of mental health education and de-stigmatisation. HPB launched the ""It's OKAY to Reach Out"" campaign in October 2021 to normalise the topic of mental health by building awareness and encouraging conversations. The campaign in 2022 was focused on youths to help them overcome their hesitation to seek support and address their concerns about seeking help. Activities such as teacher-guided class discussions were brought to mainstream schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). Outreach efforts to promote mental health awareness and literacy among Singaporeans have continued through online efforts and in-person programmes."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00616,2023-05-10-T-017,616,Janil Puthucheary,"In addition to all this, the National Council of Social Services (NCSS)' Beyond the Label (BTL) movement which was launched in 2018 by NCSS, continues. In the next phase, BTL 2.0 moves to inspire action. NCSS has brought together 26 partners across the people, public and private sectors to promote and enable help-seeking and help-giving behaviours in schools, workplaces and the community."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00617,2023-05-10-T-017,617,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being was established in July 2021 to oversee and coordinate mental health efforts across different sectors, focusing on cross-cutting issues that require interagency collaboration."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00618,2023-05-10-T-017,618,Janil Puthucheary,"At the task force, we have identified 12 preliminary recommendations and sought the public's views in a consultation process last year. There were over 950 responses, with feedback from groups such as youths, parents, persons with mental health conditions, service providers, employers and community agencies."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00619,2023-05-10-T-017,619,Janil Puthucheary,"The respondents were supportive of all the recommendations and the task force will be releasing a short report of the consultation's findings soon, even as we commence with the implementation plans for these recommendations."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00620,2023-05-10-T-017,620,Janil Puthucheary,"One of the recommendations is to implement a tiered care model for mental healthcare delivery. This is a framework that matches the level of care to the degree of mental health need, allowing for a more effective allocation of mental health services based on the severity and complexity of an individual's needs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00621,2023-05-10-T-017,621,Janil Puthucheary,"As part of the public consultation, we received very useful feedback on the implementation. One example would be, for the tiered model to work well, service providers need to be sufficiently competent to fulfil their roles and responsibilities."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00622,2023-05-10-T-017,622,Janil Puthucheary,"We completely agree, that for this tiered care model to be implemented effectively, an important aspect is to ensure adequate competencies and standards amongst all mental health practitioners. So, we have the National Mental Health Competency Training Framework Workgroup. The framework that they are developing will guide mental health practitioners on the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary to deliver quality and effective care. It will apply to all practitioners, from lay responders such as peer supporters, to mental health professionals, including nurses, social workers and counsellors, amongst others. I thank Dr Wan Rizal for highlighting the importance of this."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00623,2023-05-10-T-017,623,Janil Puthucheary,"In addition, there is already a system in place to safeguard professional practice today. Mental health professionals are regulated through professional boards and councils and set practice standards through professional associations."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00624,2023-05-10-T-017,624,Janil Puthucheary,"For example, psychiatrists, nurses and occupational therapists are regulated by the Singapore Medical Council, the Singapore Nursing Board and the Allied Health Professions Council, respectively. Professional associations such as a Singapore Association for Counselling and the Singapore Psychological Society provide guidance on the professional and ethical conduct for counsellors and psychologists respectively."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00625,2023-05-10-T-017,625,Janil Puthucheary,There is also the need to help individuals with mental health needs access the appropriate services in a timely manner. One recommendation from the task force is to designate a few first-stop touch points to provide individuals with easy access to mental health support and advice.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00626,2023-05-10-T-017,626,Janil Puthucheary,"Some respondents from the consultation felt that there was value in having more than one way to deliver a service to take into account user preference. We are developing a number of service modalities such as hotlines, text messaging, in-person services and digital resources to ensure that there are sufficient and different ways for people to access these first-stop touch points for mental health."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00627,2023-05-10-T-017,627,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, if I now may shift to oral health care for older adults, persons with special needs and migrant workers in Singapore in response to Dr Shahira Abdullah."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00628,2023-05-10-T-017,628,Janil Puthucheary,"The Government has introduced initiatives to ensure the access to affordable and quality health care for Singaporeans such as through the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Most oral health needs of these population groups can be met by general dentists at the polyclinics, CHAS clinics and private dental clinics. Individuals with complex needs and those with medical conditions or multiple morbidities that require a higher level of care are cared for and can be cared for by specialists at our National Specialty Dental Centres and the hospital dental clinics."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00629,2023-05-10-T-017,629,Janil Puthucheary,"To facilitate access, MOH has worked with MSF to list the details of dentists and private dental clinics providing special care dentistry services so as to raise the awareness regarding the availability of services for persons with disabilities."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00630,2023-05-10-T-017,630,Janil Puthucheary,"Additionally public-private partnerships in addition to the existing ones like Enabling Village, Agape Village, HealthServe and Saint Andrews Mission Hospital will be further explored to better serve the primary medical and dental care needs of underserved communities including migrant workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00631,2023-05-10-T-017,631,Janil Puthucheary,"For our migrant workers, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also continue to explore working with key partners such as NGOs to facilitate accessible dental care for migrant workers and provide oral health education through Project MOCCA, the Management of Oral and Chronic Conditions and Ailments. Project MOCCA was launched by MOM last year and is a preventive health framework to enhance the care of oral and chronic diseases among workers. And in this, MOM works closely with partners such as MigrantWell Singapore."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00632,2023-05-10-T-017,632,Janil Puthucheary,"We recognise the efforts of independent volunteer initiatives that provide dental services within the community, intermediate and long-term care settings and in special needs organisations. To improve the coordination of these services, we will be encouraging larger volunteer associations to help provide a platform for communication, for sharing of resources and for coordination."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00633,2023-05-10-T-017,633,Janil Puthucheary,"As the practice of dentistry constantly evolves with changes in population demographics, advances in technology and shifts in care approaches, the local dental landscape will shift accordingly."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00634,2023-05-10-T-017,634,Janil Puthucheary,"To better support dental professionals and other healthcare and non-healthcare professionals providing care for older adults and persons with special needs, we will look into the development of clinical practice guidelines and appropriate care guides to help establish standards of care and promote better health outcomes. Additionally, we will continue to review our subsidy framework and award scholarships for residency training programmes in the various disciplines of dentistry so as to ensure our dental workforce can continue to meet the oral health needs across all ages and care settings."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00635,2023-05-10-T-017,635,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I would next like to highlight the importance of having a well-integrated and reliable IT system to connect the healthcare providers, community partners and our residents. Members of the House have raised this in past Parliamentary sessions such as the White Paper for Healthier SG and also at the Committee of Supply 2023 debate. I thank both Dr Tan Yia Swam and Mr Yip Hon Weng for emphasising its importance."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00636,2023-05-10-T-017,636,Janil Puthucheary,"One key system will be the National Electronic Health Record System (NEHR), which is a common platform that captures selected patient health information from various healthcare providers and allows providers to view these health records for patient care. Mr Gerald Giam asked about the implementation of security enhancements for NEHR. The NEHR has been subjected to cybersecurity reviews, infrastructure vulnerability scans and application penetration tests. MOH and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) have reviewed the findings and most of the key enhancements to NEHR have been completed, with one further to be completed tentatively by 2025."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00637,2023-05-10-T-017,637,Janil Puthucheary,"On the matter of IT support for GP clinics, that Mr Gerald Giam also raised. We do want GPs to use a Clinic Management System (CMS) that supports their daily operations well and connects to key IT systems, to save them time on administration. We have been working closely with the CMS vendors to improve their products and strengthen their backend services to support the GP clinics."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00638,2023-05-10-T-017,638,Janil Puthucheary,"We are bringing onboard more healthcare providers to contribute to the NEHR, by extending the Early Contribution Incentive scheme to GPs, private hospitals, radiological laboratories and clinical laboratories to support them in data contribution. With the Health Information Bill (HIB), it will become mandatory for them to contribute patients' data to NEHR."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00639,2023-05-10-T-017,639,Janil Puthucheary,"We have been extensively consulting stakeholders such as our licensees and healthcare professionals, on issues surrounding data privacy and sharing, related to the HIB. We had intended to table the HIB to Parliament sometime this year. But this is quite a very significant Bill and we felt more time is needed to engage our stakeholders and members of the public. We thus expect to introduce the Bill in this House, in the first half of 2024. I would also like to thank Mr Yip Hon Weng for raising the need to enable data sharing between the health and social sectors, this is indeed one of our aims under the HIB to support more integrated care and reduce administrative work, while ensuring data security."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00640,2023-05-10-T-017,640,Janil Puthucheary,"Ms Ng Ling Ling and Mr Yip Hon Weng also raised the need to empower Singaporeans with more knowledge and support to manage their health better. We will do this through tools such as the HealthHub and Healthy 365 applications. For example, residents and their authorised caregivers can view health information from the NEHR, such as discharge summaries, selected blood test and radiology results, via HealthHub. We will explore how we can reflect more results in these platforms. Residents and their authorised caregivers can also use HealthHub to book and manage their medical appointments across all public healthcare institutions, as well as to enrol in Healthier SG and view their Health Plan."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00641,2023-05-10-T-017,641,Janil Puthucheary,"Residents can use Healthy 365 to see and sign up for nearby healthy lifestyle programmes, track their physical activity and collect health points from clocking steps and making healthier food choices. We will continue to enhance such digital tools to help residents sustain good health and well-being."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00642,2023-05-10-T-017,642,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, in summary, with increased accessibility to trusted platforms for appropriate health information and interventions, and support from healthcare providers and community partners, we hope individuals can make informed choices to enable better mental health, better oral health and better health for themselves and their loved ones. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00643,2023-05-10-T-017,643,Deputy Speaker,Minister Ong Ye Kung.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00644,2023-05-10-T-017,644,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. I want to thank Dr Tan Yia Swam, Dr Shahira and Mr Abdul Samad for tabling this Motion, and pointing out passionately that health is everyone's concern, and it is only with everyone’s action that we can improve the health of individuals and our nation."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00645,2023-05-10-T-017,645,Ong Ye Kung,"I would also like to thank all the Members of Parliament and representatives of Ministries who have, through your speeches, supported the various health-related policies and also given suggestions for improvements. This includes Healthier SG, our preventive care strategy; championing the well-being of our healthcare workers; developing more centralised IT systems; group buying of drugs with private doctors; ensuring that healthcare remains affordable for everyone and so on."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00646,2023-05-10-T-017,646,Ong Ye Kung,"Members have also raised a range of challenges and frustrations of the healthcare system. Indeed, healthcare is probably one of, if not the most, complex public service systems in our whole public service. It will be unrealistic of me if I were to say we have a solution to every problem that you have raised. Even if we have, theoretically, it is not practical to implement them all. We will need to work within the budget and time resources we have, our management bandwidth to plan and effect change, our people's appetite to accept changes. We have to improve step by step."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00647,2023-05-10-T-017,647,Ong Ye Kung,"What we will do is to prioritise the areas that we can make the most meaningful changes, where there is bang for the buck and focus on them. This is what we are doing."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00648,2023-05-10-T-017,648,Ong Ye Kung,"So, we are focusing on expanding our healthcare capacity, which includes manpower, rolling out Healthier SG, and building up an effective system for ageing in community. Together, they represent a major transformation of our healthcare system in the medium-term."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00649,2023-05-10-T-017,649,Ong Ye Kung,"But before I talk about these priorities, let me first address three specific issues on healthcare that were raised by Members  manpower, financing and as Prof Jamus Lim just raised, healthcare capacity. It is last minute, but I will respond to you."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00650,2023-05-10-T-017,650,Ong Ye Kung,"First, manpower. At the heart of any healthcare system are the workers. Several Members of Parliament such as Dr Tan Yia Swam, Ms Janet Ang, Dr Wan Rizal, Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Abdul Samad and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas have spoken about the issues confronting them."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00651,2023-05-10-T-017,651,Ong Ye Kung,"We have to support healthcare workers as much as we can. The NTUC and Healthcare Services Employees' Union (HSEU) have been fervent supporters for the welfare of healthcare workers. Ms Thanaletchimi, President of HSEU, used to be a Nominated Member of Parliament in this House and spoken about it many times."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00652,2023-05-10-T-017,652,Ong Ye Kung,"The partnership between the People's Action Party (PAP) Government and the Labour Movement is a strong institutionalised arrangement, and MOH looks forward to our continued partnership in advancing the welfare of our healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00653,2023-05-10-T-017,653,Ong Ye Kung,"Part of this work, very importantly, is to regularly review remuneration of healthcare workers, to ensure that we recognise their contribution and to make sure that remuneration is competitive. Mr Leon Perera suggested some benchmarking. We will internally benchmark not just the pay but also taxes – because it varies across countries – and also the living conditions and rental. But I suggest we do this internally, because competition is now so tough, you do not want to benchmark and then show everybody. But we certainly want to benchmark and make sure we are competitive. Right now, in fact, rental becomes a problem for foreign nurses to come to Singapore and out of pocket expenses are high. These are some things we need to address to make sure we are competitive."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00654,2023-05-10-T-017,654,Ong Ye Kung,"Of particular urgency now is to actively recruit both local and foreign healthcare workers to boost the workforce, given the rising attrition suffered in the last two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00655,2023-05-10-T-017,655,Ong Ye Kung,"For local healthcare workers, we are looking forward to the inflow of the latest batch of polytechnic graduates who, I think, just graduated and they will be joining the workforce and our hospitals soon."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00656,2023-05-10-T-017,656,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Abdul Samad had feedback about interns not getting paid for their internships. I would like to clarify this. All Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and polytechnic nursing students are given allowances for their internship attachments. However, for certain healthcare-related courses, such as Biomedical Science, allowances are an arrangement left between employers and the school to set, and practices can differ across health clusters. But given the Member's feedback, let us look into the specific instances where our public health institutions do not offer internship allowances."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00657,2023-05-10-T-017,657,Ong Ye Kung,"As for foreign healthcare workers, it takes time to conduct selection and examinations overseas and for the shortlisted candidates to move here. They have so far been trickling into Singapore, but we hope in the second half of the year, more of them will start to come onboard."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00658,2023-05-10-T-017,658,Ong Ye Kung,"And for those who have performed well and are committed to Singapore, we welcome them to apply for permanent residency (PR). A few Members of Parliament (MPs) have suggested granting PR status to their dependents as well. We thank the MPs for their suggestion. This is worth serious consideration."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00659,2023-05-10-T-017,659,Ong Ye Kung,"For everyone in our healthcare workforce, we will need to ensure their well-being. I am glad many MPs spoke up against abuse and harassment of healthcare workers. This is one of the top issues in the minds of our healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00660,2023-05-10-T-017,660,Ong Ye Kung,"I think, in general, I would say, to be fair, the regard and appreciation for healthcare workers has generally gone up amongst our society post COVID-19. And for the majority of the public, they are appreciative and respectful towards our healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00661,2023-05-10-T-017,661,Ong Ye Kung,"Those who physically assault, threaten or hurl vulgar and condescending remarks against healthcare workers, I think is really a small minority. But because the acts are so egregious, it feels like a big thing. And it is a big thing. We cannot tolerate such behaviour. This is unfair to healthcare workers and unfair to the great majority of the public who respect our healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00662,2023-05-10-T-017,662,Ong Ye Kung,"As Members know, MOH has recently announced a zero-tolerance policy against abuse and harassment of healthcare workers. And we intend to translate this to procedures and guidelines for all our healthcare institutions in the second half of this year. I will not elaborate what it entails as I have spoken about this before."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00663,2023-05-10-T-017,663,Ong Ye Kung,"But since the announcement of the policy, I have noticed some reactions. First and the best is that most members of the public support the policy. Second, a few raised concerns that there were occasions where healthcare workers did not behave appropriately. We acknowledged that. There are always a minority of black sheep. But there are appropriate channels to report such matters and the hospital management will look into them seriously."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00664,2023-05-10-T-017,664,Ong Ye Kung,"Some have said that one of the root causes of abuse is the heavy workload at the hospitals and long waiting times, and therefore, we should address that first. We are doing what we can to alleviate the situation at the hospitals post COVID-19. It will take time. But heavy workload cannot be an excuse for anyone to physically or verbally abuse our healthcare workers."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00665,2023-05-10-T-017,665,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Raj Thomas mentioned that another reason is expectations are high and when it is not met, people get upset. It is totally all right to have expectations and to demand good service. By all means, do that, but there is no need to abuse healthcare workers should service delivery fall short."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00666,2023-05-10-T-017,666,Ong Ye Kung,"I should say that notwithstanding the heavy workload and the occasional abuse and harassment, most healthcare workers I have met – and I hope it is not just because I am Minister – remain positive, professional and passionate about their jobs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00667,2023-05-10-T-017,667,Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Koh Fang Qi, for example, was a senior staff nurse in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital since 2015. She has now become a Nurse Manager. Over the years, she dealt with many abusive patients and next-of-kin, but she continued to calmly handle each one with empathy and became an expert in this field."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00668,2023-05-10-T-017,668,Ong Ye Kung,"Once, she witnessed a junior nurse being abused physically and verbally by the next-of-kin of a patient. So, she bravely stood up, managed the situation and escalated the incident to the authorities for follow-up and remained calm throughout the incident."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00669,2023-05-10-T-017,669,Ong Ye Kung,"And despite all these challenges, you can tell she loves her job. She continues to treat patients and their loved ones with care and kindness. She constantly shares her knowledge and experience dealing with abuse cases with her colleagues."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00670,2023-05-10-T-017,670,Ong Ye Kung,"The test of zero-tolerance policy is in the second half of this year when we have guidelines and supervisors to disengage abusive patients or most likely, their next-of-kin. I do expect some to write to the Ministry to complain to me why do our supervisors and nurses act this way. We will be very careful. We will make sure that we will effect the consequences only for the most genuine cases and care will always be prioritised. Should I get a complaint, I will back our ground supervisors; and healthcare workers. Should it comes to this Chamber, because I think some of the residents will complain to their MPs  ""why MOH act like that, can they appeal against this, they disengaged with me and I was just demanding good service."""
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00671,2023-05-10-T-017,671,Ong Ye Kung,"When the time comes and test comes, I hope to have the support of this House. We will be careful and we will do it judiciously if we ever have to disengage an abusive patient or next-of-kin, so, I seek the support of the whole House."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00672,2023-05-10-T-017,672,Ong Ye Kung,Let me move to healthcare financing. Mr Leong Mun Wai made a few points yesterday.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00673,2023-05-10-T-017,673,Ong Ye Kung,"I am glad he agreed with our policy to use MediFund to support low-income families. The MediFund disbursed $164 million in FY2021, not $100 million as stated by Mr Leong yesterday. The Government further topped up MediFund by $1.5 billion in FY2023."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00674,2023-05-10-T-017,674,Ong Ye Kung,"However, Mr Leong also delivered a political statement yesterday. He declared the Progress Singapore Party (PSP)'s position that Government ought to spend more in healthcare like other OECD countries."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00675,2023-05-10-T-017,675,Ong Ye Kung,Let me make a few points in response.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00676,2023-05-10-T-017,676,Ong Ye Kung,"First, it is widely known that spending more on healthcare does not mean better health outcomes. Most health economists will know that. Since Mr Leong is benchmarking ourselves against OECD countries, let us just cite two examples, US and UK. They are spending about 17% and 10% of their GDPs on healthcare, compared to us, 4%. Yet, US and UK continue to face high incidence of chronic illnesses, high obesity rates and their expected lifespans are lower than Singapore."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00677,2023-05-10-T-017,677,Ong Ye Kung,"I was inspired by Mr Eric Chua and also checked out ChatGPT  ""what do you think of the US system, what do you think of the UK system"". Actually, it is quite well-known. In the US, healthcare is very expensive, despite spending 17% of their GDP. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) is crushed down by the workload. The waiting times are far longer than in Singapore, despite spending 10% of their GDP on healthcare."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00678,2023-05-10-T-017,678,Ong Ye Kung,We have delivered good health outcomes given what we are spending.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00679,2023-05-10-T-017,679,Ong Ye Kung,"The second point, for whatever we are spending, we are able to make healthcare affordable for middle to lower-income groups. Today, about seven in 10 of Singaporeans in subsidised wards do not have to pay any out-of-pocket expenses. Eight in 10 pay less than $100 cash out-of-pocket; nine in 10 pay less than $500 in cash out-of-pocket."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00680,2023-05-10-T-017,680,Ong Ye Kung,"So, when Mr Leong asked the Government to spend more to lower out-of-pocket expenses further, he really meant to channel resources to unsubsidised patients, that is, those staying in A class wards or private hospitals. This is where the big bucks and the big expenditure are, and it will push our healthcare expenditure and spending to the levels of the OECD countries."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00681,2023-05-10-T-017,681,Ong Ye Kung,"Third, while Mr Leong asked Government to spend on healthcare, he failed to mention that Government expenditure ultimately has to be raised from the people through taxes. Mr Leong had not made any mention of where PSP will get the funding from."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00682,2023-05-10-T-017,682,Ong Ye Kung,"Fourth, the fact is that we are already spending more and more on healthcare. We do not need Mr Leong's urging. Healthcare spending is going up. In the decade after 2010, our nominal Government health expenditure tripled. In the following decade, that means up to 2030, it is expected to triple again. So, triple and triple – it means an increase by nine times over 20 years. This is driven by an ageing population, who is also getting sicker. MOH already has the second largest Ministry budget, after Ministry of Defence (MINDEF)."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00683,2023-05-10-T-017,683,Ong Ye Kung,"In the coming years, our challenge is not to spend more, but to ensure we do not go the way of many OCED countries, with the healthcare fiscal burden spiralling and escalating out of control."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00684,2023-05-10-T-017,684,Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, it is therefore much better that we continue our sensible and practical approach  have different layers of safety nets – subsidies, MediShield Life, which I thank Prof Hoon Hian Teck for explaining why it is necessary, MediSave and MediFund. This is the S+3Ms approach, which has worked quite well."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00685,2023-05-10-T-017,685,Ong Ye Kung,"We now combine this with a very important strategy in Healthier SG and our effort to enable ageing in communities, so that we can avoid sickness and reduce our disease burden even as our population ages."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00686,2023-05-10-T-017,686,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Leong also talked about the seemingly large balances in the Pioneer Generation (PG) and Merdeka Generation (MG) Funds, and concluded that more subsidies can therefore be given to PG and MG members."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00687,2023-05-10-T-017,687,Ong Ye Kung,"His understanding is misplaced. Both Funds were sized based on the projected lifetime cost of the benefits, and accounting for inflation and interest accrued."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00688,2023-05-10-T-017,688,Ong Ye Kung,"To illustrate, the oldest and youngest MG member is about 73 and 64 years old. PG members will be at least 10 years older, with the youngest at 74 years old now. They still have quite a bit of runway ahead of them and we do expect many of them to live until 90 or 100 years old. So, their lifetime benefits need to be funded from the MG and PG Funds. But the Government will continue to regularly review the adequacies of these two Funds."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00689,2023-05-10-T-017,689,Ong Ye Kung,"Third issue is healthcare capacity that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim just raised. We agree that 80%, 85% occupancy rate is probably ideal. And you do not need an engineer to conclude that you must have redundancy in your system. It is not a new concept. It is something that I think we all agree to."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00690,2023-05-10-T-017,690,Ong Ye Kung,"But why is there a crunch now? Of course, there will be crunch during COVID-19. It was an emergency, it was a crisis of a generation. I do not think any country or any system can plan for that kind of capacity to cater to a crisis. But post-crisis, we do have a crunch today."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00691,2023-05-10-T-017,691,Ong Ye Kung,"I explained in this House before, I think it was during the White Paper debate on COVID-19, that the main reason for the crunch is that within a very short span of two years, you suddenly see average length of stay going up significantly. It used to be six days. Now, it is 7.1 days. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Minister for Health"", Official Report, 10 May 2023, Vol 95, Issue 104, Correction By Written Statement section.]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00692,2023-05-10-T-017,692,Ong Ye Kung,"This means your utilisation has suddenly gone up by 15%, over two years, post-COVID-19."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00693,2023-05-10-T-017,693,Ong Ye Kung,"It is a post-COVID-19 phenomenon. I think in time, researchers and clinicians will study why. But there could be a few hypotheses. One is that there is some kind of immunity debt – more old folks are getting infected with viruses, bacteria post-COVID-19. And when they do, they fall quite sick and they actually stay in hospitals for quite long. And that pushes up average length of stay."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00694,2023-05-10-T-017,694,Ong Ye Kung,"Another reason, which is a possible one, is that during COVID-19, too many of our seniors decided to hide at home, afraid to come out. There were no more community activities, which actually is so crucial to keep them healthy. So, with social isolation, their health deteriorated. And then, when they get infected, they stay in the hospital for very long."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00695,2023-05-10-T-017,695,Ong Ye Kung,"The 15% increase in utilisation alone explains why we have a crunch now. And it is happening not just in Singapore. It is happening all over the world. Every country is facing a crunch in their beds. All of us agree we must have redundancy but all of us are facing a crunch, including and especially in OECD countries, despite their higher bed to population ratio."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00696,2023-05-10-T-017,696,Ong Ye Kung,"So, what do we need to do? First, catch up on the capacity. Many of our projects have been delayed due to COVID-19. We have to catch up but some things cannot be rushed. We just have to implement them."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00697,2023-05-10-T-017,697,Ong Ye Kung,"So, sometime this year, the Integrated Care Hub at Novena will open. It will add a couple hundred beds. The Woodlands Integrated Health Campus, by end of the year, may have one ward open; hopefully, next year more wards will open. And then we have the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital and the eastern regional hospital Assoc Prof Jamus Lim talked about. We have the redevelopment of SGH campus that is ongoing. Although it is an existing campus, it is a significant redevelopment with many more beds added."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00698,2023-05-10-T-017,698,Ong Ye Kung,"Two, is to build more Transitional Care Facilities (TCFs), which I have explained before. It is actually very useful. Today, in our hospitals, there is still quite a number of seniors who are staying there not because of medical reason, but because of social reasons. TCFs have rehabilitative care and good medical facilities, and we can allow those who are stable to move to TCFs, thus freeing up acute beds. So, we are building that up quite actively."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00699,2023-05-10-T-017,699,Ong Ye Kung,"Third is recruitment, which I have explained before. I think although it is very competitive, Singapore continues to be an attractive location for foreign nurses to want to come to Singapore. The healthcare profession continues to be quite attractive to our locals as well. Today, one in 25 students will join nursing and I cannot hope for more. That is not bad at all considering the number of options they have. So, I think we are getting our fair share of local talent and we are competitive in hiring foreign nurses as well."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00700,2023-05-10-T-017,700,Ong Ye Kung,"But of course, I hope the House, having raised all these issues, will support the necessary steps that we need to take in order to recruit local as well as foreign nurses."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00701,2023-05-10-T-017,701,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me come back to the substance of the Motion, which is really why we are here – and it is an important Motion, urging a whole-of-Government approach to support healthcare, even after the COVID-19 crisis has passed."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00702,2023-05-10-T-017,702,Ong Ye Kung,"Our Public Service has a long history of inter-agency collaboration. But COVID-19 was special. It was a period when we witnessed the tremendous potential of inter-agency cooperation, united in a common objective to overcome a national crisis."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00703,2023-05-10-T-017,703,Ong Ye Kung,"If you look at our schools, they kept education going, shifted to home-based learning only for a couple of months. Our economic and social agencies worked together to support businesses and workers. Various agencies got together to set up quarantine facilities, testing and community care facilities. I cannot emphasise enough how much that meant to the hospital system, which would have, otherwise, borne the full brunt of the pandemic and we would have likely collapsed."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00704,2023-05-10-T-017,704,Ong Ye Kung,"Recently, a well-known Chinese infectious disease expert, Dr Zhang Wen Hong, after he observed how life in China has gone back to normal during the May Day Golden Week, he wrote a blog post and he said, “It was as if nothing had happened, yet everything has happened”. In Chinese, 一切都没发生，一切都已发生."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00705,2023-05-10-T-017,705,Ong Ye Kung,"It was a rather poignant expression of the post-crisis state of mind which may be relevant in Singapore and relevant to today’s debate. We do not want to hang on to and relive the crisis. We need to walk out of the shadows, put it behind us and look into the future. And yet so much has happened. The experience and lessons learnt will reshape the way we look at healthcare and the way we look at inter-agency collaboration. Those cannot be forgotten and go to waste."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00706,2023-05-10-T-017,706,Ong Ye Kung,"So, I share Members’ hope that while the crisis may be over and peace time workload has resumed, it cannot be business as usual. We should usher in a new era of even tighter inter-agency collaboration. And this is especially relevant for healthcare for two reasons."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00707,2023-05-10-T-017,707,Ong Ye Kung,"Number one, as I have explained, ageing is probably the biggest social transformation for Singapore in the next 10 years, as we become a “super-aged” society. This will have implications across multiple policy areas – in employment, in our competitiveness, retirement adequacy, urban planning, education and, of course, healthcare. It will draw Ministries together to work in concert."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00708,2023-05-10-T-017,708,Ong Ye Kung,"Second, post COVID-19 crisis, we have decided that the conditions and timing are right for us to effect a major healthcare transformation, building upon all the work that was done in previous years. I have explained in this House why and what we are doing in this transformation. Essentially, the idea is that healthcare needs to go beyond treating sickness in hospitals and clinics, but creating health in homes and communities. In other words, health is not just relevant to patients who have fallen sick. Health is for all. And that is why we now regard the healthcare system as three inter-linked systems."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00709,2023-05-10-T-017,709,Ong Ye Kung,"If I may briefly recapitulate. Ms Janet Ang has just explained this earlier. First, we have the acute care system, which is essential in ensuring that those who are sick get treatment. Second, the population health system, which we are building up through Healthier SG, and we are mobilising all our family doctors and GPs to focus on preventive care that is anchored in the community. The third system is the aged care system. The default for aged care cannot be nursing homes or seniors living alone with no social support."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00710,2023-05-10-T-017,710,Ong Ye Kung,"In other countries, loneliness and social isolation of seniors have become an epidemic. We also see this happening in Singapore. I think it is one of the reasons why length of stay has gone up, especially after COVID-19."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00711,2023-05-10-T-017,711,Ong Ye Kung,"If we can do this right, I think we can do what Mr Yip Hon Weng suggested – integrate care across medical and social realms."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00712,2023-05-10-T-017,712,Ong Ye Kung,"And we need to urgently step up this whole-of-society efforts to enable our seniors to live their golden years in dignity, age actively in their community with their friends and family, involve them in activities including training programmes, like what Mr Mark Chay has suggested. And if they wish, leave well in a family environment surrounded by their loved ones. So, this aged care in community is the next major area of work in healthcare."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00713,2023-05-10-T-017,713,Ong Ye Kung,"To make Health for All possible, we need the contribution of every stakeholder, public or private. When healthcare is mostly treating sickness, it falls under the domain of hospitals. But when healthcare is about creating health and caring for people in their homes and communities, it becomes everyone’s business. Hence, in order to realise Health for All, we also need All for Health. I think this is really the spirit behind the Motion put forward by the Members."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00714,2023-05-10-T-017,714,Ong Ye Kung,"In particular, the following stakeholders can make significant contributions to health."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00715,2023-05-10-T-017,715,Ong Ye Kung,"First, employers. I thank Dr Tan Yia Swam for speaking on this. Many of us spend a considerable amount of our adult lives at work and hence the workplace is highly influential in shaping our health habits. I value our existing partnerships with NTUC, SNEF and the Tripartite Oversight Committee on Workplace Safety and Health (TOC) who have been working with companies to promote good workplace health practices."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00716,2023-05-10-T-017,716,Ong Ye Kung,"With Healthier SG, employers can work closely with your panel doctors to join Healthier SG and to continue providing regular and proper screenings for employees, provide healthier canteen food, physical activity programmes, mental well-being programmes and better work-life balance. We also urge employers to play their part in making sure those eligible are all part of Healthier SG. By promoting good health, employers will have more productive and happier employees, which is good for businesses."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00717,2023-05-10-T-017,717,Ong Ye Kung,"Second are our community partners. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua has shared about MCCY’s efforts to mobilise the community to foster social cohesion, promote health and develop a strong partnership with family doctors. Dr Tan Yia Swam also suggested the need to have activities that cater to different segments of population and their varied interests. Indeed, when we consulted the public during Healthier SG, we heard from many residents that peer and family influence is a key factor in motivating them to adopt healthy life habits, such as regular exercise and to eat healthily."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00718,2023-05-10-T-017,718,Ong Ye Kung,"So, under Healthier SG, our healthcare clusters will work with community partners – HPB, PA, SportSG – to proliferate physical activities in the community and encourage strong participation by residents. We welcome other ground-up initiatives and activities that rally the community. If we take a walk in our public parks today, we can spot many of these activities. Many of them not organised by any agencies. Friends getting together to cycle, run, play football. Masters teaching their disciples qigong or tai-chi. All of them are now part of the healthcare system."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00719,2023-05-10-T-017,719,Ong Ye Kung,"Third area, schools and education institutions. I thank Minister of State Gan Siow Huang for speaking about MOE’s efforts in building this health foundation for our young."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00720,2023-05-10-T-017,720,Ong Ye Kung,"Indeed, good health starts from our values, habits and choices. Our schools help to build this foundation of health literacy. They introduce our young to sports, help them make friends and form social groups, teach them life skills and knowledge to be useful citizens, all of which are essential building blocks to good health. As mentioned by Minister of State Gan Siow Huang earlier, through the years, MOE has worked with MOH to thoughtfully infuse health education in its curriculum from early childhood to primary, secondary and tertiary education."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00721,2023-05-10-T-017,721,Ong Ye Kung,"Research findings now show good health habits, such as proper diet and use of devices, inculcated from as young as three or four years old, have a profound impact on the cognitive development and well-being of the child later on in life. And it actually does affect their PSLE results, based on our research findings. [Laughter.] Maybe that is the right button to push, I do not know."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00722,2023-05-10-T-017,722,Ong Ye Kung,"So, MOH, MOE and MSF; we are studying the linkages between early education and health, and developing possible interventions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00723,2023-05-10-T-017,723,Ong Ye Kung,"Fourth, the media. Information and media literacy is our first line of defense against false and viral health myths. We will continue to work with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and other media agencies to do this, just as we did during COVID-19 to dispel falsehoods about vaccination."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00724,2023-05-10-T-017,724,Ong Ye Kung,"Healthier SG gives us an opportunity to address the problem of health misinformation. How so? This is because we are advocating and trying to build stronger patient-doctor relationships. Because with a trusted relationship and the family doctor and his care team knowing the health condition and history of the patient, they become the patient’s trusted source of medical information and advice."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00725,2023-05-10-T-017,725,Ong Ye Kung,"In this digital era of information overload, online falsehoods, myths and AI bots, perhaps what we need in healthcare is stronger human relationships, especially between doctors and patients. We can use technology to strengthen the relationship and improve the quality of care rather than replace the human relationship. That must ultimately be the mode of co-existence between humans and AI."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00726,2023-05-10-T-017,726,Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, our infrastructure and transport planners. Over the years, MND and MOT colleagues have expanded green spaces, cycling paths and fitness corners islandwide to support active living. There are also plans to have more Silver Zones and Green Man+ at pedestrian crossings to allow our seniors to travel more safely and with confidence in their neighourhood."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00727,2023-05-10-T-017,727,Ong Ye Kung,These are many examples of how agencies are coming together to better support health and we are committed to continue to do so.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00728,2023-05-10-T-017,728,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me conclude."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00729,2023-05-10-T-017,729,Ong Ye Kung,"I am mindful that our Nominated Members of Parliament are coming to the end of their term. This is perhaps your second last Sitting. I do not know for sure, but Leader told me, it might be your second last Sitting. I know some of you hope to have the assurance that even as you step down, the issues close to your heart continue to receive attention in this Chamber."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00730,2023-05-10-T-017,730,Ong Ye Kung,"So, I feel honoured and privileged – although it got me a bit busy – that you have chosen to table a Motion on healthcare, just as you have actively been speaking up on healthcare issues during your term. In particular, Dr Tan Yia Swam, who was also the President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA). She has been a strong advocate for various healthcare-related issues."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00731,2023-05-10-T-017,731,Ong Ye Kung,"I attended an SMA dinner some time ago hosted by her. In her speech during that event – it is public, so I think I can say it – she said that she was an angry young doctor. And now, you are a less angry middle-aged doctor. But the difference is that you have learned how to channel your energy to a greater good and be a better advocate."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00732,2023-05-10-T-017,732,Ong Ye Kung,"I say Dr Tan is doing a good job, both in SMA as well as in this House. But I do not think Dr Tan is angry. It is important that we are passionate in our cause and be active in our advocacy."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00733,2023-05-10-T-017,733,Ong Ye Kung,"I greatly appreciate this Motion, highlighting the need for MOH to work with other agencies and for other agencies to support us. Today, we have MOE and MCCY's political officeholders (POHs) deliver their speeches. Actually, we could have gotten many more, but we did not want to prolong the debate for too long."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00734,2023-05-10-T-017,734,Ong Ye Kung,Ageing is going to be the big challenge that affects all of us – and MOH cannot be alone in this.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00735,2023-05-10-T-017,735,Ong Ye Kung,The passion and activism of our NMPs help uplift the standard of debate in this House and bode well for the democratic discourse for Singapore.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00736,2023-05-10-T-017,736,Ong Ye Kung,"So, please rest assured that the issues close to your hearts will continue to be given due attention in this House, even as your term comes to an end. There will be a new batch of NMPs who are passionate about issues too, and take up the issues that you care about."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00737,2023-05-10-T-017,737,Ong Ye Kung,"On healthcare, there will be MPs who are healthcare professionals, Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Members for Health, Labour MPs and NMPs, Members who feel strongly about healthcare who will carry the torch forward. Most importantly, the MOH political officeholders will continue to put forth our agenda and address the concerns of our stakeholders. We are not on different sides. We are all on the same side, trying to make the system better for Singaporeans."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00738,2023-05-10-T-017,738,Ong Ye Kung,"For NMPs, after you have stepped down, I hope you will continue to advise and cheer us on, at the side. So, let us all continue to advocate for a better healthcare system for everyone. Health is for All and All is for health. [Applause.]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00739,2023-05-10-T-017,739,Deputy Speaker,Dr Tan Yia Swam.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00740,2023-05-10-T-017,740,Tan Yia Swam,"Thank you, Sir. First, I thank Minister Ong. Okay, maybe not so angry anymore, after all your kind words. If you are going to stay 10 years like Mr Gan, then I will continue to advise and help for 10 years."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00741,2023-05-10-T-017,741,Tan Yia Swam,"Sir, I am very heartened by the strong support for the Motion."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00742,2023-05-10-T-017,742,Tan Yia Swam,"First of all, I thank all my fellow NMPs in attendance who have each shared their insights into how healthcare can be supported in their various sectors. This is the kind of fresh ideas that we need to have a synergistic whole."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00743,2023-05-10-T-017,743,Tan Yia Swam,"Next, I thank all Members for their various speeches covering a wide range of topics in relation to support for healthcare, namely  (a) recruit, reskill and retain healthcare workers; (b) fair pay, reasonable working hours; (c) financing and business needs; (d) better IT systems; (e) taking a firm stand against bullying and harassment; (f) emphasis on prevention and primary care; (g) legal protection and support; and (h) looking after vulnerable groups, in particular, children, the elderly, migrant workers and the differently-abled."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00744,2023-05-10-T-017,744,Tan Yia Swam,"However, I must address some of the points that the Member Mr Leong brought up yesterday. I appreciate his points about reviewing MediSave but I urge him to have in-depth discussions with MOH to better understand the current funding and to help in future reviews if necessary."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00745,2023-05-10-T-017,745,Tan Yia Swam,"MediSave and MediShield Life have been extensively and rigorously reviewed to ensure that the majority of Singaporeans and Permanent Residents can afford medical care when they opt for subsidised wards in restructured hospitals. If any of you know residents in financial distress, please direct them to an experienced medical social worker who will be able to further advise on additional available subsidies."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00746,2023-05-10-T-017,746,Tan Yia Swam,"I also need to seek clarification from Mr Leong on his comment that, I quote, ""drug prices should not be marked up unreasonably for non-subsidised patients to cross-subsidise subsidised patients."""
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00747,2023-05-10-T-017,747,Tan Yia Swam,"Firstly, is there have evidence of this happening? Secondly, what is the definition of an ""unreasonable"" mark-up?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00748,2023-05-10-T-017,748,Tan Yia Swam,"If I can use another food analogy other than chicken rice, a can of soda can be sixty cents at a budget grocery mart, $1.30 at a super mart, $1.60 at a coffee shop, $3 in a restaurant and $5 in a hotel. How much is a reasonable mark-up for medications?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00749,2023-05-10-T-017,749,Tan Yia Swam,"Patients who are not subsidised will be patients who opt in for A or B1 class, or foreigners. I, as a doctor, would think that allowing market forces to determine costings are fair. Would Mr Leong also want taxpayers to pay for everyone?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00750,2023-05-10-T-017,750,Tan Yia Swam,I also thank the political office holders from different Ministries for your assurance and commitment to support healthcare.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00751,2023-05-10-T-017,751,Tan Yia Swam,I thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua in advocating for sports across different Government agencies and active community engagement. Parkour aunties like myself rejoice. No more Police chasing us off.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00752,2023-05-10-T-017,752,Tan Yia Swam,Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has also given an overview of how teaching on exercise and healthy eating is integrated at all levels of education.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00753,2023-05-10-T-017,753,Tan Yia Swam,"I thank Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary and Minister Ong Ye Kung for their detailed and candid replies in recognising complex problems of manpower, IT and financing."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00754,2023-05-10-T-017,754,Tan Yia Swam,"The professional bodies will continue to work closely with MOH in resolving issues within healthcare, especially those that pertain to training and working hours. Honestly, only clinicians truly understand the delicate balance needed. I am glad that we are all aligned in this – that healthcare has to be a whole-of-Government effort."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00755,2023-05-10-T-017,755,Tan Yia Swam,"In my closing, I come full circle, back to ""Why"". Why do we stand up to advocate for a cause? To leave behind a better world than the one we were born in."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00756,2023-05-10-T-017,756,Tan Yia Swam,"Recent news regarding the next round of NMP applications has again raised some criticism. I believe the NMP role has given an ordinary citizen like myself the chance to voice opinions at a national platform. Ordinary, because I am a struggling working mother in the sandwiched generation. Ordinary, because I also fear and worry about my children's future. What kind of Singapore will my children grow up in?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00757,2023-05-10-T-017,757,Tan Yia Swam,"Fellow MPs will appreciate how hard it is to prepare for a speech. It is not just simply coming up to the microphone and saying some fancy words. There is background research, sticking to the timing before getting scolded by the Speaker or Deputy Speakers; and speaking the truth – in a palatable way and driving home a point."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00758,2023-05-10-T-017,758,Tan Yia Swam,"I commented before – we are all talking a lot, but who is listening? Is the public listening?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00759,2023-05-10-T-017,759,Tan Yia Swam,"The livestreaming only has 400 plus viewers, usually. A few people will deliberately make funny clips of our mistakes or slip-ups. And yes. Once I get over the embarrassment of my own, I have to say, it is actually very funny, so, thanks for making us laugh!"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00760,2023-05-10-T-017,760,Tan Yia Swam,"But the people I am really speaking to are fellow citizens who share my interest in the larger good of Singapore, the citizens listening in and considering policy."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00761,2023-05-10-T-017,761,Tan Yia Swam,"Maybe some of you are civil servants. Singapore has 150,000 public officers who report to the Government, not to any one political party. I rephrase for emphasis. Civil servants are individuals who would have their own different political beliefs and alignments. They serve the people of Singapore."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00762,2023-05-10-T-017,762,Tan Yia Swam,"Blindly supporting or opposing any political party or mocking NMPs for being mouthpieces or puppets or blaming the Government for everything – I ask you, is it logical? Does it serve anyone?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00763,2023-05-10-T-017,763,Tan Yia Swam,"Before reacting and speaking, consider three points  one, is it true? Two, is it necessary? Three, is it kind? If the answer is no to any of the above, maybe it is better not to say."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00764,2023-05-10-T-017,764,Tan Yia Swam,I am sure that many of you have friends who are in healthcare. Do speak to them and understand the problems we face. Create your own small little informal think tanks and brainstorm on how to solve larger healthcare issues.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00765,2023-05-10-T-017,765,Tan Yia Swam,"For all the people listening in, whether you are working in Ministries, whether you are an ordinary citizen like myself, I hope that you will also think of ways to ensure that healthcare gets the support it needs and prioritise your own healthcare needs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00766,2023-05-10-T-017,766,Tan Yia Swam,"We now live in a rapidly changing and volatile world. Look at how COVID-19 brought the world to a standstill for three lost years. Look at the Ukraine war, the US bank collapses. Overnight, the world changes. Nothing is new. History repeats itself – maybe in a much faster cycle than before."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00767,2023-05-10-T-017,767,Tan Yia Swam,"The modern person has to be able to adapt to a world where answers may be less obvious, where there is no rulebook or 10-year-series to refer to. There may be no single right answer and choices will have trade-offs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00768,2023-05-10-T-017,768,Tan Yia Swam,"Should war ever come to Singapore, should there be an apocalypse, we will need warriors, we will need leaders. But I tell you, we will need people who know how to look after others, people who know how to stop bleeding, prevent infections, deliver babies, how to grow food, how to get clean water – any kind of knowledge to ensure that we survive."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00769,2023-05-10-T-017,769,Tan Yia Swam,But are we building up on useful knowledge or frittering our time away on social media in mindless entertainment?
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00770,2023-05-10-T-017,770,Tan Yia Swam,"I see patients and the medical treatment algorithms are actually quite simple. There is a breast lump. It needs to be checked. But frequently, emotional stress gets in the way. This manifests as hesitation, fear, worry and even anger at me – ""Why is there a lump?"""
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00771,2023-05-10-T-017,771,Tan Yia Swam,"I understand but it is not easy to process the onslaught of negative emotions. Healthcare workers, teachers, drivers – all frontline service workers, in fact – have received the brunt of a lot of negative outpouring of emotions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00772,2023-05-10-T-017,772,Tan Yia Swam,"This is our society now. A pressure cooker. People being unhappy in their daily lives without even realising it, feeling irritable, snappy, overly critical, worried about everything and feeling unable to cope."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00773,2023-05-10-T-017,773,Tan Yia Swam,"I repeat a point from my previous speech. Recognise mental health issues in yourself or your loved ones. If you suffer from anxiety or anger management, do not take it out on your healthcare worker. Do not take it out on others. Get help from a mental health professional."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00774,2023-05-10-T-017,774,Tan Yia Swam,"Even though I am a breast surgeon, I cannot just operate on the cancer. I have to consider the patient in her whole entirety. Her overall health – does she have other medical conditions that impact her surgery and recovery? Her preferred language – does she fully understand what I am saying? Is she making a true informed decision? How is her personality like? Her social network? Is she going to be well supported at home and at the workplace or will she forgo care because she perceives that others' needs come before her?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00775,2023-05-10-T-017,775,Tan Yia Swam,The surgery itself is simple in expert hands. It is helping the patient to overcome all these other emotional and mental barriers to seek health and to eventually be on the road to recovery – that is the challenge for which I call for a global change and a whole-of-Government support.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00776,2023-05-10-T-017,776,Tan Yia Swam,"I thank everyone who has taken part in the debate and I emphasise. First, walk the ground, get real feedback and acknowledge problems in healthcare. Second, continue education at all levels of engagement. Third, cross-collaborate across Ministries, across industries, across the public-private divide."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00777,2023-05-10-T-017,777,Tan Yia Swam,Humans have short memories. Let us learn from the mistakes of the past so that we do not repeat it. People care only when things affect them. Help me and make everyone care.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00778,2023-05-10-T-017,778,Tan Yia Swam,"Finally, breaking formal protocol, I want to thank Shahirah, Samad, Lian Pin, Mark, Janet, Joshua, Hian Teck and Hsing Yao. Thank you all for your friendship. It has been an eventful and fun NMP journey."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00779,2023-05-10-T-017,779,Tan Yia Swam,"To all MPs from both sides of the House, I am glad for the chance to get to know you all as people and real humans, not just as public figures on your posters. This is my last speech in this Chamber. The next time we meet again, it may be when I complain to you at Meet-the-People sessions. [Laughter.]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00780,2023-05-10-T-017,780,Tan Yia Swam,"I thank you all – both sides of the House – for your service to Singapore. If I may, I will pray for wisdom and kindness for you as you all continue to debate meaningfully on issues to guide Singapore safely through future challenges. [Applause.]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00781,2023-05-10-T-017,781,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Leong, I am about to put the question to the House. You have a clarification arising from a speech that has been given? Do you have a clarification for Dr Tan? Yes, you want to respond to her questions, right?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00782,2023-05-10-T-017,782,Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I thank Dr Tan for asking the questions on drug subsidies."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00783,2023-05-10-T-017,783,Leong Mun Wai,"According to my understanding and a lot of the feedback from residents, they pay different prices when they are in different classes. Of course, that is expected. Currently, different classes have different charges."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00784,2023-05-10-T-017,784,Leong Mun Wai,"But from a certain angle, which I have mentioned in my speech, it is okay to charge the services, but why is there such a big difference in the drug prices being charged for different classes? So, this is what I have said. I do not know why Dr Tan raised it as an issue."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00785,2023-05-10-T-017,785,Leong Mun Wai,Maybe I can also clarify with Dr Tan whether she agrees with our proposal that the Government should actually start a central procurement process for all drugs in Singapore. I would like to ask for her opinion on this.
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00786,2023-05-10-T-017,786,Deputy Speaker,"Dr Tan, do you wish to respond?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00787,2023-05-10-T-017,787,Tan Yia Swam,"Yes, I would like to respond because I am a doctor and I think I know a bit about healthcare."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00788,2023-05-10-T-017,788,Tan Yia Swam,"I think firstly, regarding bills, to the hon Member, it would be useful to ask your affected residents to approach the hospital's business office that they were in to seek clarification on the bill breakdown. There are very clear explanations and breakdowns on the tiers of subsidies available and different drugs, whether it is branded or generic, have very, very clear costings."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00789,2023-05-10-T-017,789,Tan Yia Swam,"So, I would like to know more details of the case rather than make a blanket statement that the costings are unfair."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00790,2023-05-10-T-017,790,Tan Yia Swam,"In relation to the second question for the Government to procure all medicines, I understand that right now, there is a procurement for all medications for chronic conditions, for public medical institutions."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00791,2023-05-10-T-017,791,Tan Yia Swam,"In the private sector, though, may I respectfully state that all doctors in the private sector have our own business models and different ways of generating income. So, not all doctors may want to be part of the Government effort. I thank the Member for his suggestion. We can take it back to the professional bodies and further get our members' feedback."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00792,2023-05-10-T-017,792,Deputy Speaker,"Minister Ong Ye Kung, you have a clarification?"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00793,2023-05-10-T-017,793,Ong Ye Kung,"I just thought that it is not very fair that the NMP has to answer a policy question. So, it is better for MOH to say something."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00794,2023-05-10-T-017,794,Ong Ye Kung,"Ours is a variegated healthcare system, unlike, say, NHS, where everything is nationalised, all drug prices are more or less the same, centrally procured."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00795,2023-05-10-T-017,795,Ong Ye Kung,"We are deliberately catered to a variegated market. And for private sector doctors, as Dr Tan Yia Swam said, they do have different models. There are doctors that charge very low consultation fees, but instead, they earn some margins by selling their drugs. Others do the reverse."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00796,2023-05-10-T-017,796,Ong Ye Kung,"So, when we put forward an idea – but, luckily, it is from the Member and not from me. If we put forward an idea to say, ""Let us all sell at the same price"", actually, doctors, their rice bowls gets affected and it can be quite a major issue for them."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00797,2023-05-10-T-017,797,Ong Ye Kung,"So, I think there is some wisdom in what Dr Tan Yia Swam said. In the private space, sometimes, you want to let market forces operate, but, at the same time, have some discipline through how we structure insurance, what we subsidise, what we do not. And I think that is how we reign in unnecessary healthcare costs."
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00798,2023-05-10-T-017,798,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I know Mr Leong has more questions. But really, I think this is a Motion about Ministries and all of us, all stakeholders coming together, a very meaningful Motion. And I would urge that we do not prolong further this to-ing and fro-ing and let us give our stepping-down NMPs strong support for their very meaningful Motion. [Applause.]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00799,2023-05-10-T-017,799,Ong Ye Kung,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00800,2023-05-10-T-017,800,Ong Ye Kung,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That this House commits to supporting healthcare beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and the whole-of-Government efforts for consistent and sustainable support."" (proc text)]"
2023-05-10-T-017-S-00801,2023-05-10-T-017,801,Deputy Speaker,Leader.
2023-05-10-T-018-S-00802,2023-05-10-T-018,802,,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed."" – [Ms Indranee Rajah]. (proc text)]"
2023-05-10-T-018-S-00803,2023-05-10-T-018,803,,Adjourned accordingly at 5.18 pm.
2023-05-10-T-019-S-00804,2023-05-10-T-019,804,Rachel Ong,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Government has been monitoring the number of people who cycle to work; and (b) whether there has been a study on commonly used cycling routes to office buildings in and outside of the Central Business District with the intent of eventually setting up cycling lanes on these routes.
2023-05-10-T-019-S-00805,2023-05-10-T-019,805,S Iswaran,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) conducts travel surveys to better understand the mode of transport that people use for their work commutes. Recent surveys showed that the proportion who primarily cycle to work remains small, at less than 2%."
2023-05-10-T-019-S-00806,2023-05-10-T-019,806,S Iswaran,"LTA had recently completed six kilometres of cycling paths in the Central Area, stretching from Clarke Quay to Bayfront and Tanjong Pagar. There are also existing and upcoming cycling networks in regional centres, such as Tampines, Woodlands and Jurong. Other than intra-town cycling paths, we are also exploring options for longer-distance commutes. One such example is the North-South Corridor, designed with a cycling trunk route that would connect cyclists directly from the northern region to the city."
2023-05-10-T-019-S-00807,2023-05-10-T-019,807,S Iswaran,"LTA will continue to consider factors, such as connectivity to transport nodes, amenities and workplaces, feedback from the local community and site conditions, when planning for cycling paths island-wide. We are also working closely with fellow Government agencies to bring jobs closer to homes in our suburban heartlands, which will make cycling more viable as a work commute choice."
2023-05-10-T-020-S-00808,2023-05-10-T-020,808,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can provide an update on the progress of the negotiation and finalisation of the code of conduct for the South China Sea that is being drawn up by ASEAN and China.
2023-05-10-T-020-S-00809,2023-05-10-T-020,809,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In-person negotiations on the Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea had resumed last May, after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Negotiators are currently on the second reading of the draft text. Singapore will continue to work towards an effective and substantive COC that is in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and that safeguard the rights and interests of all parties in the South China Sea."
2023-05-10-T-021-S-00810,2023-05-10-T-021,810,Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the tight labour market and the stronger Singapore dollar has adversely affected Singapore’s competitiveness in securing investments into Singapore.
2023-05-10-T-021-S-00811,2023-05-10-T-021,811,Gan Kim Yong,"Amidst strong economic headwinds, we must strengthen efforts to keep Singapore competitive, continue to attract investments, generate growth and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Our fundamentals remain strong and we expect to meet our medium-term investment commitment targets, barring unforeseen circumstances."
2023-05-10-T-022-S-00812,2023-05-10-T-022,812,Alex Yam Ziming,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the situation in Sudan (a) whether there are any Singaporeans known to be in Sudan; and (b) what is being done to provide them with assistance to evacuate from the outbreak of civil war in the country.
2023-05-10-T-022-S-00813,2023-05-10-T-022,813,Vivian Balakrishnan,"There are currently no MFA-registered Singaporeans in Sudan. As conveyed in MFA Spokesperson’s Comments of 27 April 2023, two Singaporean families, comprising 14 Singaporeans and a family member, were safely evacuated from Khartoum, Sudan to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with assistance from the governments of Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates."
2023-05-10-T-022-S-00814,2023-05-10-T-022,814,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Singapore Government reiterates its deepest appreciation to the three governments for facilitating the safe evacuation of our citizens.
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00815,2023-05-10-T-023,815,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for the latest round of property cooling measures; (b) whether the prices and demand of residential properties have gone ahead of market fundamentals; and (c) whether the rising interest rates will also have an effect of dampening the property market.
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00816,2023-05-10-T-023,816,Desmond Lee,"My response to the Parliamentary Question (PQ) filed by Mr Liang Eng Hwa on the latest round of property market measures will also address other PQs for written answer filed by Mr Shawn Huang and Mr Chong Kee Hiong for the Sitting on 10 May, and the PQ filed by Ms Hany Soh scheduled for a subsequent Sitting."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00817,2023-05-10-T-023,817,Desmond Lee,"The Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) was introduced in 2011 to moderate demand for private residential property, and to promote a stable and sustainable property market. In calibrating the ABSD rates, we consider a multitude of factors, such as the prevailing economic and property market conditions and outlook, trends in property prices and income growth, as well as the profile of property buyers."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00818,2023-05-10-T-023,818,Desmond Lee,"We recently raised the ABSD rates for some categories of property buyers, with effect from 27 April 2023."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00819,2023-05-10-T-023,819,Desmond Lee,"This follows two earlier rounds of measures, in December 2021 and September 2022, to temper housing demand and encourage greater financial prudence."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00820,2023-05-10-T-023,820,Desmond Lee,"These measures, coupled with the broader economic climate and mortgage interest rate increases, have had a moderating effect on property price growth. However, our housing market has remained relatively resilient. Private housing prices showed renewed signs of acceleration, increasing by 3.3% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 0.4% in the previous quarter."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00821,2023-05-10-T-023,821,Desmond Lee,"This resilience is a result of strong housing demand. Local owner-occupation demand is especially strong and is increasing with changing social norms. As we emerge from the pandemic, there is also renewed interest from local and foreign investors in our residential property market."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00822,2023-05-10-T-023,822,Desmond Lee,"Between the two, our priority is to support Singaporeans who buy property for owner-occupation. We raised the ABSD rates to moderate both local and foreign investment demand, so as to prioritise Singaporeans’ owner-occupation needs. This round of ABSD changes will only affect about 10% of all property transactions, based on 2022 data. This will not affect locals purchasing their first property, who make up about 90% of all property transactions in 2022. We are acting pre-emptively, as investment demand for residential property is likely to continue to grow otherwise. Should price momentum continue amidst slowing economic growth and elevated interest rates, prices could run ahead of economic fundamentals, risking a sustained increase in prices relative to incomes."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00823,2023-05-10-T-023,823,Desmond Lee,We recognise that there are significant concerns about rising rental prices and the impact on business costs. We do not expect the recent ABSD revisions to have a significant impact on the rental market. The vast majority of foreigners working in Singapore rent their homes and will not be affected by the recent ABSD revisions.
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00824,2023-05-10-T-023,824,Desmond Lee,"The tight supply conditions brought on by the pandemic had led to an exceptional imbalance in the rental market. However, we expect to see signs of easing, with a large number of new residential units being completed over the next few years. We are expecting 40,000 home completions this year – the highest in the last five years – and about 100,000 completions by 2025. Households temporarily renting while awaiting the completion of their new homes will also move out of their rental units and into their new homes. We, therefore, expect pressures in the rental market to ease with this large supply entering the market, and we already see early indications that rental demand is abating. This will moderate rent increases in the coming quarters."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00825,2023-05-10-T-023,825,Desmond Lee,"We also do not expect the recent ABSD revisions to have a significant impact on the commercial property market. The drivers of the residential and commercial property markets are very different. Demand for commercial properties tends to be driven by business considerations and commercial property transactions are generally of much higher value than for residential properties. Individual buyers make up nearly all of the residential property market but only about 10% of the commercial property market. Historically, commercial property prices and transaction volumes have also remained stable in the period following past increases to the ABSD rates."
2023-05-10-T-023-S-00826,2023-05-10-T-023,826,Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, we will continue to keep a close eye on both the commercial as well as residential property markets and will take further steps, if necessary, to promote a stable and sustainable property market."
2023-05-10-T-024-S-00827,2023-05-10-T-024,827,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry or IRAS will tighten the processes involving decoupling by families or couples who may wish to buy an additional property; and (b) whether the Ministry will also tighten processes for foreign families who buy multiple properties under the names of different family members to avoid the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty.
2023-05-10-T-024-S-00828,2023-05-10-T-024,828,Lawrence Wong,"The Government recognises that families and individuals may enter into various property purchase and ownership arrangements for different reasons and needs, and taking into account the tax and non-tax consequences. Depending on the arrangement, Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) may be payable."
2023-05-10-T-024-S-00829,2023-05-10-T-024,829,Lawrence Wong,"Today, ABSD is tiered by property count for Singaporean Citizen and Permanent Resident buyers. No ABSD applies for Singaporean Citizen buyers purchasing their first residential property. Foreigners are liable for the highest individual ABSD rate of 60%, regardless of the number of properties they own. So, even if foreign families buy multiple properties under the names of different family members, they will still have to pay the ABSD of 60% for each property."
2023-05-10-T-024-S-00830,2023-05-10-T-024,830,Lawrence Wong,The Government will continue to monitor the residential property market closely and consider the appropriate adjustments needed to promote a stable and sustainable property market.
2023-05-10-T-025-S-00831,2023-05-10-T-025,831,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Government, as the largest employer in Singapore, will consider supporting the professionalisation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Singapore, by extending the subsidy for public officers’ medical expenses to cover TCM treatments performed at clinics by practitioners who are registered with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board."
2023-05-10-T-025-S-00832,2023-05-10-T-025,832,Chan Chun Sing,"The Civil Service subsidises standard medical treatments, tests and medication for officers. This includes TCM acupuncture treatments administered under the direction and referral of a doctor registered with the Singapore Medical Council, and carried out at hospitals and clinics registered under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act."
2023-05-10-T-026-S-00833,2023-05-10-T-026,833,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Prime Minister what is the estimated number of Singaporeans qualified to be elected as President as of 31 December 2022 as broken down by (i) those who fulfil the public sector service requirement, (ii) those who fulfil the private sector requirement, serving as chief executive in Government-linked companies (GLCs) and non-GLCs respectively."
2023-05-10-T-026-S-00834,2023-05-10-T-026,834,Chan Chun Sing,"The Elections Department does not track the number of Singaporeans qualified to be elected as President. There are currently about 50 Public Service positions that may fulfil the public sector service requirement. For persons relying on the private sector service requirement, there are currently more than 1,200 companies with average shareholders’ equity at or exceeding $500,000,000."
2023-05-10-T-027-S-00835,2023-05-10-T-027,835,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for each year since 2010, what are the number and percentage of private property leases where the tenants are (i) Singapore Citizens, (ii) Singapore Permanent Residents and (iii) non-residents respectively."
2023-05-10-T-027-S-00836,2023-05-10-T-027,836,Lawrence Wong,We are unable to provide such a long time series of data. The breakdown of the private residential property leases by the profile of tenants from 2018 to the third quarter of 2022 is at Table 1.
2023-05-10-T-027-S-00837,2023-05-10-T-027,837,Lawrence Wong,"In 2018 and 2019, the proportion of Singapore Citizen tenants was 15%. This increased to 19% in 2021 primarily due to a surge in demand from Singaporeans seeking temporary accommodation while awaiting the completion of their residential units affected by COVID-19 construction delays. On the other hand, foreigners’ demand dropped due to outflow of foreigners. In 2022, with the easing of border restrictions, the tenant profile for private residential properties is now more similar to pre-COVID-19 trends."
2023-05-10-T-027-S-00838,2023-05-10-T-027,838,Lawrence Wong,
2023-05-10-T-028-S-00839,2023-05-10-T-028,839,Rachel Ong,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what is the number of people from vulnerable groups that have been hired due to Government project tenders containing ""set aside"" clauses to hire vulnerable people groups in the last 10 years; (b) what percentage of the vulnerable people group hired are people with disabilities; and (c) whether there are plans for more Government tenders to include ""set aside"" clauses for vulnerable people groups or have a preferred supplier programme for firms with the Enabling Mark."
2023-05-10-T-028-S-00840,2023-05-10-T-028,840,Lawrence Wong,"We do not centrally track the number of people from vulnerable groups that are employed through Government tenders. Nevertheless, Government agencies may, from time to time, procure from organisations that support or hire vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities. For instance, in a tender for contact centre services by the Public Service Division, the awarded contractor was required to hire and reserve at least 10% of the jobs created by the contract for persons with disabilities and senior citizens."
2023-05-10-T-028-S-00841,2023-05-10-T-028,841,Lawrence Wong,Each agency has the autonomy to decide on including “set aside” clauses for vulnerable groups and having a preferred supplier programme for firms with the Enabling Mark.
2023-05-10-T-028-S-00842,2023-05-10-T-028,842,Lawrence Wong,"The Government adopts other non-procurement measures to facilitate the hiring of people from vulnerable groups. These include job placement and job support services, as well as grants to support the employability and employment of persons with disabilities. The Ministry of Social and Family Development is also developing Enabling Business Hubs to better enhance employment support and opportunities at the regional level, closer to where persons with disabilities and caregivers live."
2023-05-10-T-029-S-00843,2023-05-10-T-029,843,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of the manufacturing sector in Singapore contracting by 6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2023 (a) what is the projected manufacturing outlook for the rest of 2023; and (b) whether there will be any wider knock-on effects on the Singapore economy.
2023-05-10-T-029-S-00844,2023-05-10-T-029,844,Gan Kim Yong,"The manufacturing sector contracted by 5.6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2023. The outlook for the sector for the rest of 2023 remains weak, given the slowdown in the global economy and the electronics downcycle."
2023-05-10-T-029-S-00845,2023-05-10-T-029,845,Gan Kim Yong,"The downturn in the manufacturing sector is expected to dampen the performance of sectors that facilitate the trading of manufactured goods, such as the wholesale trade and water transport sectors."
2023-05-10-T-030-S-00846,2023-05-10-T-030,846,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Transport for each year since 2010 (a) what is the (i) median, (ii) 90th percentile and (iii) 99th percentile of the open market value of cars registered under Category A COEs; and (b) what is the (i) 1st percentile (ii) 10th percentile and (iii) median of open market value of cars registered under Category B COEs."
2023-05-10-T-030-S-00847,2023-05-10-T-030,847,S Iswaran,"We do not track the data to this level of detail. As I shared in my Ministerial Statement on Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans on 8 May 2023, the Category B median Open Market Value (OMV) has been about 75% higher than the Category A median OMV in recent years. Specifically, for the first quarter of 2023, the Category A median OMV was $25,525, and the Category B median OMV was $44,866. ["
2023-05-10-T-031-S-00848,2023-05-10-T-031,848,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for Transport how will the new public transport fare adjustment formula as announced by the Public Transport Council on 25 April 2023 affect the cost of transportation for commuters today.
2023-05-10-T-031-S-00849,2023-05-10-T-031,849,S Iswaran,This Question has been addressed in my reply to Question No 9 for Oral Answer on the Order Paper for 9 May 2023. [
2023-05-10-T-032-S-00850,2023-05-10-T-032,850,Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how long will the trial to power up Raffles Lighthouse with tidal energy last; and (b) what are the other opportunities of harnessing tidal energy in Singapore.
2023-05-10-T-032-S-00851,2023-05-10-T-032,851,S Iswaran,The trial to power Raffles Lighthouse using tidal energy is expected to run for six months.
2023-05-10-T-032-S-00852,2023-05-10-T-032,852,S Iswaran,"Should the trial show that tidal energy is viable, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore will study suitable sea areas around Singapore where tidal energy can be adopted."
2023-05-10-T-033-S-00853,2023-05-10-T-033,853,Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry is exploring more opportunities to replace diesel powered harbour crafts and ferries with electric ferries; and (b) whether the Ministry has set a target for this conversion.
2023-05-10-T-033-S-00854,2023-05-10-T-033,854,S Iswaran,"During the Ministry of Transport's Committee of Supply (COS) Debate in March 2023, we announced the plans for harbour craft operating in our port waters to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050."
2023-05-10-T-033-S-00855,2023-05-10-T-033,855,S Iswaran,More details can be found on MOT’s COS 2023 webpage  https //www.mot.gov.sg/what-we-do/cos2023.
2023-05-10-T-034-S-00856,2023-05-10-T-034,856,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there are enough Special Education schools (SPED) for all students with special educational needs; and (b) whether the Ministry will expand the list of eligible conditions for entry into SPED schools.
2023-05-10-T-034-S-00857,2023-05-10-T-034,857,Chan Chun Sing,"There are currently 24 Government-funded Special Education (SPED) schools that cater to different profiles of students with moderate-to-severe Special Educational Needs (SEN). By the 2030s, there will be 28 schools. The Ministry of Education regularly monitors the demand for SPED school places and works with the Social Service Agencies that run the schools to cater to the needs of different SPED profiles."
2023-05-10-T-034-S-00858,2023-05-10-T-034,858,Chan Chun Sing,"Not every child with SEN is best supported in a SPED school. For admission to SPED, a diagnosis of SEN provided through a psychological assessment by a qualified professional is required. In addition, a SPED school will consider the cognitive, psychological, social and physical needs of each child to determine whether the school is suitable for that child. The process is done in consultation with a panel of qualified professionals where necessary."
2023-05-10-T-035-S-00859,2023-05-10-T-035,859,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the past five years, what percentage of new admissions to Children and Young Persons Homes are children who live in public rental flats; and (b) whether the Ministry will collect this data if such data is unavailable."
2023-05-10-T-035-S-00860,2023-05-10-T-035,860,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I had answered a similar Parliamentary Question by Mr Louis Ng on 10 January 2023. The trend has not changed. [
2023-05-10-T-036-S-00861,2023-05-10-T-036,861,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the top three concerns relating to the needs and aspirations of families with school-going children living in rental housing who have been engaged through surveys under the nation-wide Community Link (ComLink) programme; and (b) how does the Ministry intend to address these concerns.
2023-05-10-T-036-S-00862,2023-05-10-T-036,862,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComLink families’ top three expressed aspirations are to purchase a flat, build up savings and see their children do well at school. Key concerns expressed include their financial circumstances, their children’s future, their health and housing stability."
2023-05-10-T-036-S-00863,2023-05-10-T-036,863,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComLink provides families with support that encompasses the 3Cs – Comprehensive, Convenient and Coordinated. Once they have access to 3C support, we will work with them on specific goals and action plans for them to attain the 3Ses of Stability, Self-Reliance and Social Mobility."
2023-05-10-T-036-S-00864,2023-05-10-T-036,864,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Achieving the 3Ses requires active effort on the part of the ComLink family, working in partnership with the ComLink officer and ComLink befriender assigned to them. As part of Forward Singapore, we are engaging widely with practitioners, young Singaporeans and other stakeholders on the part the community can play to uplift their fellow Singaporeans."
2023-05-10-T-037-S-00865,2023-05-10-T-037,865,Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for Health whether further investigations will be made on the safety of over-the-counter Traditional Chinese Medicine products that have been approved by HSA, such as Lianhua Qingwen, Qing Fei Clearing Tablet and Qing Fei Pai Du, for consumption by the general population given their widespread use and distribution."
2023-05-10-T-037-S-00866,2023-05-10-T-037,866,Ong Ye Kung,I believe the Member is asking this question due to a recent media report of an individual who developed anaphylaxis after taking Lianhua Qingwen. Investigations are ongoing and there is currently no evidence to suggest the causality of the allergic reaction and consumption of Lianhua Qingwen.
2023-05-10-T-037-S-00867,2023-05-10-T-037,867,Ong Ye Kung,"Traditional Chinese Medicine products, such as Lianhua Qingwen, are natural herbal products that are not regulated like pharmaceutical medicines by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). Allergic reactions may occur in any individual susceptible to the substances present in health products, just as in the case of food."
2023-05-10-T-037-S-00868,2023-05-10-T-037,868,Ong Ye Kung,"Nevertheless, HSA will conduct post-market surveillance of such products and take necessary actions."
2023-05-10-T-038-S-00869,2023-05-10-T-038,869,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development how many buyers of million-dollar resale HDB flats have previously held private properties.
2023-05-10-T-038-S-00870,2023-05-10-T-038,870,Desmond Lee,"Between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023, around 1% of the resale transactions registered, or 389 flats, were sold for a million dollars or more. Among the buyers, almost three in 10, or 108 buyers, previously owned a private property or were holding on to a private property at the point of resale flat application."
2023-05-10-T-039-S-00871,2023-05-10-T-039,871,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for National Development what are the framework and indicators to guide the levels of the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty in the medium- to long-term future.
2023-05-10-T-039-S-00872,2023-05-10-T-039,872,Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for National Development regarding the higher Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) for residential properties (a) whether the higher ABSD will affect the residential rental market and business costs; (b) what is the expected impact on the number of foreigners intending to invest and take up employment in Singapore as this leads to increased cost of owning and renting properties; and (c) what is the expected effectiveness in moderating residential property prices if it results in higher rents which can then be used to pay higher mortgages.
2023-05-10-T-039-S-00873,2023-05-10-T-039,873,Desmond Lee,The response to this question also addresses the Parliamentary Questions on the latest round of property market measures filed by Mr Liang Eng Hwa for the Sitting on 10 May and Ms Hany Soh for the Sitting on or after 11 May.
2023-05-10-T-039-S-00874,2023-05-10-T-039,874,Desmond Lee,"The Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) was introduced in 2011 to moderate demand for private residential property and to promote a stable and sustainable property market.

Local owner-occupation demand is especially strong and is increasing with changing social norms. As we emerge from the pandemic, there is also renewed interest from local and foreign investors in our residential property market."
2023-05-10-T-039-S-00879,2023-05-10-T-039,879,Desmond Lee,"Between the two, our priority is to support Singaporeans who buy property for owner-occupation.

We do not expect the recent ABSD revisions to have a significant impact on the rental market. The vast majority of foreigners working in Singapore rent their homes and will not be affected by the recent ABSD revisions.
2023-05-10-T-039-S-00881,2023-05-10-T-039,881,Desmond Lee,"The tight supply conditions brought on by the pandemic had led to an exceptional imbalance in the rental market. However, we expect to see signs of easing, with a large number of new residential units being completed over the next few years.

Households temporarily renting while awaiting the completion of their new homes will also move out of their rental units and into their new homes. We, therefore, expect pressures in the rental market to ease with this large supply entering the market, and we already see early indications that rental demand is abating.

2023-05-10-T-039-S-00882,2023-05-10-T-039,882,Desmond Lee,"We also do not expect the recent ABSD revisions to have a significant impact on the commercial property market. The drivers of the residential and commercial property markets are very different. Demand for commercial properties tends to be driven by business considerations and commercial property transactions are generally of much higher value than for residential properties. Individual buyers make up nearly all of the residential property market but only about 10% of the commercial property market. Historically, commercial property prices and transaction volumes have also remained stable in the period following past increases to the ABSD rates."

2023-05-10-T-041-S-00887,2023-05-10-T-041,887,Tan See Leng,"The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) officers regularly inspect dormitories regulated under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act. These inspections cover measures to ensure food safety and hygiene, such as ensuring that cooking areas within dormitories are clean and well-maintained. Dormitory operators must only cater food from licensed sources and take reasonable measures to ensure that the delivered food is protected from contamination until it is collected by residents, such as setting up proper food storage and collection points. Dormitory operators must also ensure that non-refrigerated food storage facilities are designed to keep out pests."
