2023-07-04-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Health what safeguards exist to ensure access to polyclinic care for seniors aged 65 years and above who (i) cannot go online to book appointments and (ii) repeatedly find that online slots are already fully booked.,1,1,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00001
2023-07-04-T-001,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health whether it is possible to release polyclinic next-day appointment slots in a few fixed tranches each day rather than have a single release of time slots at 10.00 pm.,1,2,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00002
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 1 and 2 on today's Order Paper?",1,3,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00003
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Please go ahead.,1,4,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00004
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,My response will also cover the matters raised in the written questions by Dr Tan Wu Meng.,1,5,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00005
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Our healthcare system is facing increasing demands, as our people age and need more healthcare, including primary care. At the same time, the completion of new polyclinics that were planned had been delayed due to the pandemic.",2,6,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00006
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"As a result, some polyclinics have greater demand and less easy availability of appointments. Pending the development of new polyclinics, they are putting in place short-term measures to address this.",3,7,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00007
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The polyclinics will set aside some slots for walk-in patients with urgent medical needs, as well as for elderly patients, particularly those who are frail and who have mobility issues. To do so, non-urgent cases may be given an appointment for another day or advised to seek treatment at a nearby Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) general practitioner (GP) clinic. Polyclinics will also try to leverage telemedicine as much as possible and contract private GPs to help deliver the service.",4,8,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00008
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Some polyclinics already adopted the practice of releasing polyclinic appointments in tranches. However, this does not solve the issue of capacity constraint and in fact may frustrate patients more if they are repeatedly unable to book appointments.",5,9,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00009
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,The Ministry of Health (MOH) does not have the data requested by Member Dr Tan Wu Meng.,6,10,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00010
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.,1,11,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00011
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. I have two supplementary questions. I have Clementi residents, especially seniors who are worried about the experience of the polyclinic booking system. One resident tried to make an online booking for her elderly mother – four days in a row, logged in at the booking time, could not get a slot. Another senior, not IT-savvy, cannot go online, went to a polyclinic, was told to book online. He cannot go online.",1,12,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00012
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Can I ask the Senior Minister of State two supplementary questions? Firstly, can the Ministry and the polyclinics explore the role of a hotline, so that seniors who cannot log in with smart phones and computers can still have a chance at the online booking process? Secondly, can we try to further improve the subsidy for consultations at CHAS GP clinics so that a visit to a CHAS GP clinic can receive comparable subsidy to a visit at a polyclinic?",2,13,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00013
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank Dr Tan for the questions. We will continue to explore the role of things like hotlines and other ways to improve our processes so that the appointments and the services available at the polyclinics are indeed more accessible and more user-friendly, especially to seniors. I thank him for his suggestion and I will take that up with the teams that our running our polyclinic systems.",1,14,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00014
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The question of subsidies at the CHAS GP clinics and how they relate to the charges and the costs at the polyclinics is an important one. As Dr Tan knows and as Members know, this is something we are constantly reviewing, on an ongoing basis. We will have to constantly review the conditions as well as the level of subsidy that we provide for the CHAS GP clinics and indeed, taking into account the relationship with what happens on the polyclinics. I thank him for the reminder that we have to keep doing this.",2,15,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00015
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.,1,16,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00016
2023-07-04-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Madam. I want to echo what Dr Tan Wu Meng has said. I do continue to receive feedback from our seniors who have said it is almost impossible to make an online appointment at the polyclinic run by National University Health System (NUHS) at Bukit Panjang. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether we are able to set aside some walk-in appointment slots, especially for the seniors so that they do not have to go through that online booking? Not everyone is able to do that.",1,17,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00017
2023-07-04-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Secondly, I feel it is puzzling. Notwithstanding MOH having built new polyclinics with increased capacity, why is it the case that we are still not able to meet the demand?",2,18,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00018
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank Mr Liang for his questions. We do indeed set aside a proportion of the slots for walk-in appointments. So, not all the appointment slots at a given polyclinic, on a given day, are only for online appointments. There are slots that are set aside for walk-in patients. The potential walk-in patients are assessed and so, sometimes, they will be given advice to come back on another day or to seek help at a GP clinic, depending on what it is they present with.",1,19,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00019
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sorry, I did not quite catch the second question. Oh, the capacity. Indeed, the capacity is constrained. There is a combination of factors  there has been a delay in the building and operationalisation of polyclinics as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; some of them delayed by up to two years. Recently, in the news, we had the Khatib and Sembawang Polyclinics' timings talked about. But there is also an increasing demand as our population ages and the aged have increasing frailty and co-morbidities that will require further care. So, it is a combination of growing demand and the projected supply having been constrained by the pandemic. We are trying our best to catch up and provide more services to increase our capacity.",2,20,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00020
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Leader of the Opposition.,1,21,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00021
2023-07-04-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Just to the Senior Minister of State on this point again, is it possible to increase the number of walk-in slots at the polyclinics in view of the feedback that many Members of this House are receiving from seniors who have difficulties in accessing the online system and making a booking? Can the Senior Minister of State also give us an indication of the percentage of these slots which are walk-in slots?",1,22,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00022
2023-07-04-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The other supplementary question pertains to the number of feedback MOH has received on complaints of not being able to book a slot through the online system. Does the Senior Minister of State have some numbers for us, so we can understand the extent of the problem?",2,23,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00023
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank Mr Pritam Singh for the questions. I do not have the data to answer his second question; that was not part of the Parliamentary Question that was filed. For his first question, yes, there is the possibility to increase the proportion of walk-in slots. I would point out that that does not change the overall capacity available at the polyclinics. That is actually the heart of the issue.",1,24,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00024
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I understand there is frustration with the online system for seniors, but there are also people who are able to use the online system and as a result, the availability of the resources and the capacity for the services at the polyclinics are better matched to those patients. It means that the clinical notes are available ahead of time, preparations can be made ahead of time for investigations, tests and the allied health services that support, given the instance of someone coming down to the polyclinic.",2,25,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00025
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I think we have to have a balance. If we went to a fully walk-in system, that would have an implication on the ability for the care teams to deliver the service that they are used to delivering. If we went to a fully online system, indeed, the frustrations that Members in this House have highlighted will become worse.",3,26,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00026
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, we need a balance  we need some walk-in slots and some pre-booked slots. The question then is, what is the best way of determining that balance. This is left to the operational teams running the polyclinic to take into account their capacity, the services that they deliver, the demographics of their population. And it can vary over time.",4,27,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00027
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I take the feedback from the Leader of the Opposition and other Members of the House, and will continue to work with our cluster management and operational teams that run the polyclinics and see how we can optimise the correct balance of online appointments made ahead of time, same-day appointments and walk-ins.",5,28,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00028
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.,1,29,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00029
2023-07-04-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. As a result of the difficulties in booking polyclinic slots, how many senior patients have gone to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments at the hospitals for non-emergency cases?",1,30,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00030
2023-07-04-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Secondly, will MOH consider training Active Ageing Centre (AAC) staff to help seniors book polyclinic appointments, since AACs are located within the community and the neighbourhood?",2,31,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00031
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank Mr Yip for his questions. I do not have the data for the first question that he has asked. It is possible that we are unable to get the data because what he is asking for is those who have not booked, how to track them. I would be happy to try and fulfil but I do not have the data with me today.",1,32,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00032
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,The second question is a good suggestion. We are happy to explore how we can leverage on other types of resources to be able to help people have better access and utilisation of services. I will work with the teams to explore the use of that suggestion.,2,33,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00033
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.,1,34,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00034
2023-07-04-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Like many others who have shared in this House, Sengkang residents have had significant difficulties getting online. To a Parliamentary Question that was filed in March earlier this year, some of our residents are waiting as much as 2.5 hours on the long tail. One question that I wonder in terms of increasing the number of walk-in slots – what the Leader of the Opposition said earlier – is if we could channel more of those that are currently booking online toward telemedicine options. The reason behind that is, of course, those who are sophisticated enough to book online, may be also much more comfortable with addressing a telemedicine option.",1,35,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00035
2023-07-04-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Related to this, one reason why many younger and more Internet-savvy patients tend to go toward the polyclinics is because there is still a discrepancy between for some employers what is recognised to be a valid medical certificate (MC) – whether you need a polyclinic MC versus a regular GP MC. I understand this falls a little bit beyond the remit of the MOH and more on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Nevertheless, I wonder if this is something that can be explored a little further in terms of guidelines that the Government offers toward allowing for MCs that are across a wider range of providers.",2,36,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00036
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank Assoc Prof Lim for his suggestions and questions, and the acknowledgement that I am not going to comment on MOM's remit.",1,37,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00037
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Indeed, we are exploring the use of telemedicine to improve the delivery of services from the polyclinics. I think we leave it to the professional teams in terms of how they assess the referral information, the patient demographic, as well as the presenting problems as to which patients can be dealt with an online consultation and which patients will need an in-person appointment. I think that is something for a clinical judgement, rather than a policy position. But we will support the teams so that we can optimise the use of telemedicine and make sure that we improve the capacity available at the polyclinics.",2,38,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00038
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.,1,39,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00039
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, just two more supplementary questions to the Senior Minister of State. I also declare that I am a medical doctor at a public hospital. My first additional supplementary question relates to Mr Yip Hon Weng's query about patients who could not make a booking but later on sought A&E care. May I suggest to the Senior Minister of State that my written Parliamentary Question filed yesterday may provide a way to analyse this by looking at persons who logged in the day before a next day appointment, but did not eventually make a booking? It is not the full data set but that could be a way to analyse this.",1,40,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00040
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"Secondly, can I also ask the Senior Minister of State what is being done to support our healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, allied health professionals working at our polyclinics? Because the polyclinics are very busy, our healthcare brothers and sisters are at the front lines; and we have to support them to do their best as well, for the patients and for the community.",2,41,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00041
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank Dr Tan for his suggestions and his questions. Indeed, we will continue to explore how we can track the data to inform our decisions on resourcing the polyclinics and have a balance between online appointments, walk-in appointments, and the behavourial incentives for patients to choose between them. But as I have explained, I do not have that data with me.",1,42,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00042
2023-07-04-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Tan's question about supporting healthcare workers in polyclinics is important. They have been working very hard. They continue to deal with an increase in demand, both through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, and I do want to record our thanks for the work that our primary care practitioners and the teams that they work with, have put in to support our residents and citizens and we are trying to make sure that they are as much as possible provided with access to the resources within primary care. We continue to try to support them by expanding the role of GPs, by expanding the role of CHAS clinics, by helping to make sure that we right site care within the primary care space, by providing training and staff and resources to be able to support the very important role that primary care plays in our health ecosystem. And we will continue to do so.",2,43,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00043
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.,1,44,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00044
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Madam Speaker, can I just take this opportunity because I raised my hand? I wanted to answer Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's point.",1,45,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00045
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,"Oh, I am so sorry. I did not see it.",1,46,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00046
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"All medical certificates, medical leave of absence, so long as they are issued by a licensed medical practitioner in Singapore, will be recognised. So, I hope that answers the Member's earlier point. I will move on to answer the hon Member of Parliament Mr Melvin Yong's question.",1,47,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00047
2023-07-04-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Parliamentary Question No 3?,1,48,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00048
2023-07-04-T-001,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Yes.,1,49,2023-07-04-T-001-S-00049
2023-07-04-T-002,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the recent cases of Android users losing close to $100,000 of CPF savings through malware-related scams (a) how many similar malware-related scams has the Ministry detected in the past three years; (b) what are the safeguards that the Ministry intends to implement to prevent CPF savings being lost to scammers; and (c) what recourse will the victims have with regard to their lost CPF savings.",1,50,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00050
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my response to this Parliamentary Question will also address the  Parliamentary Question",1,51,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00051
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Since January 2023, the Police received more than 700 reports of victims having downloaded malware onto their phones, with more than $8 million worth of savings lost through unauthorised withdrawals from the victims' bank accounts and so on. Based on the investigations thus far, nine of these cases involved unauthorised Central Provident Fund (CPF) withdrawals, amounting to a net loss of $124,000 in CPF savings. I would like to add that the ninth case did not result in loss of CPF savings. So, even though nine involved unauthorised CPF withdrawals, the ninth case itself did not result in the loss of CPF savings because the Singapore Police Force (SPF) managed to stop the transfer out from the bank account of the CPF member.",2,52,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00052
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),CPF monies were paid from members' CPF accounts to their own bank accounts and then they were subsequently withdrawn from these bank accounts by the scammers.,3,53,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00053
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"The modus operandi of these malware-related scams has been extensively covered in an earlier joint advisory from the Police, Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and CPF Board on 29 June 2023. In gist, the victims downloaded malware-infected Android Package Kits, or APK, from unauthorised sites and they subsequently turned on accessibility services when told by the scammer to purportedly facilitate the purchase of items at a steep discount. Doing so allowed the scammer to take full control of the phone, steal banking and Singpass credentials stored in the phone and perform unauthorised CPF log-ins and withdrawals.",4,54,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00054
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"I urge all Singaporeans to stay vigilant. We should update our phones regularly with the latest security patches and we should only download apps from official app stores and exercise the greatest of caution when we are prompted to turn on accessibility services. These accessibility services are mainly meant to assist users with disabilities to use their devices, such as by allowing apps to read and control your screen.",5,55,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00055
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"As a further precaution, CPF Board and GovTech have introduced additional authentication measures since 22 June 2023 to increase the protection for CPF members. Members may be asked to perform Singpass Face Verification (SFV) or other checks when accessing CPF e-services. This provides additional security in addition to the existing two-factor Singpass authentication required for accessing CPF e-services. Members who require assistance on CPF services and the SFV can visit the CPF service centres and Singpass counters respectively. They may also call the Singpass helpdesk.",6,56,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00056
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),These additional safeguards may make it slightly less convenient for members to perform certain CPF e-services but I think members would agree that it is better to be safe than sorry. This is especially so in light of new threats. The Government will continue to review and monitor these threats closely and work closely alongside the banks to introduce more precautionary measures where necessary.,7,57,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00057
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),The Police will spare no effort in tracking down those responsible for such malware incidents and will take tough action against them. I urge anyone with information on such crimes to contact the Police immediately.,8,58,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00058
2023-07-04-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.,1,59,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00059
2023-07-04-T-002,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, I thank the Minister for his reply. I am heartened that the Government has placed this additional precaution to require CPF members who log in to their accounts using their Singpass to go through face verification. I believe this will go some way in patching one of the vulnerabilities inherent in the Android platform that allows scammers to install malware on the users' phone.",1,60,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00060
2023-07-04-T-002,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I would like to ask what is the demographic profile of the victims who have suffered losses from these malware-related scams. My constituency, Radin Mas, has a large proportion of seniors aged 60 and above. So, while we actively encourage our seniors to embrace digitisation, I am also well aware that they will also become vulnerable to such scams. So, what is the Ministry's estimate or projection on the proportion of such malware scams that can be prevented or thwarted with the implementation of such face verification? I think the Minister earlier mentioned a ninth case was successfully prevented by the Police. So, how is the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) or CPF Board working with SPF to better detect and prevent unauthorised transfers of CPF monies?",2,61,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00061
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. For the demographics of the victims – the victims are between the ages of 55 and 80. Based on investigations, the net loss of CPF savings amounts to $124,000.",1,62,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00062
2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"From the CPF safeguards, there are the additional precautionary measures that we have now undertaken, even though we constantly monitor many of these scams because they get very creative. Thus far, we think that it is sufficient to effectively limit the convenience in terms of the withdrawal of monies from the CPF accounts to their own bank accounts.",2,63,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00063

So, there are two parallel tracks here. From the CPF Board's perspective, the additional steps that we have put in as a precautionary measure, allowing the member to separately require Singpass Face Verification, is an added step.",3,64,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00064

I mention this, in part, because as I am sure his is aware, in usual banking related frauds, insurance plays a big part in helping to recover fraudulent monies and in this case, CPF is both mandatory savings scheme but is also a very, very big supplier. So, it may be possible to secure a fairly competitive insurance rate for the purposes of doing this kind of additional protection.",1,68,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00068

This is under the Shared Responsibility Framework, which involves the financial institutions, the telcos and many other participating entities. Currently, the Government is engaging very closely with all the different industry stakeholders and we will continue to do so. There is a plan for a public consultation paper to come out in the third quarter of this year. So, I suggest that perhaps, at that particular point in time, we can delve deeper into the details.

Perhaps, Mr Giam may not have an appreciation of the different steps that these scammers sort of would navigate to actually get the CPF members to download these apps. Today, the vulnerability appears to be in the Android phones and generally our members may have just gone online, whether it is on Facebook or some other form of social media, and come across some particular app which purportedly gives him a steep discount; a very, very good deal, in which they have to download that particular app. And once they download the app, they will, more often than not, get phone calls from someone helping them to navigate and to use the app.",1,72,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00072

2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, the added precautionary measure that we have put up is that for vulnerable members, they would need an additional step of using the Singpass Face Verification.

So, I just want to understand whether or not this is something that is being looked into, as to why is it that passwords are stored inside the phone for that reason?",1,77,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00077

2023-07-04-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I cannot tell you how members will want to store their passwords to remind themselves. But I think the added measure today, first of constantly educating our public to not download any form of innocuous-looking apps from unauthorised stores, unauthorised sites and also to not just switch on the accessibility services; and at the same time, not release details to someone who is unknown over the phone and at the same time adding on the additional security verification through the Singpass Face Verification step, I think it is sufficient for us to prevent, today, unauthorised withdrawals from the CPF account. Of course, I said that there are also parallel initiatives to deal with what happens after the money goes into the banking account.",2,79,2023-07-04-T-002-S-00079

Singapore is one of the busiest maritime ports in the world. Will the BBNJ Agreement have any effect on our sea lines of communications?,1,133,2023-07-04-T-006-S-00133

2023-07-04-T-007,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the Ministry's plans to encourage seniors to adopt an active ageing lifestyle; and (b) whether such plans include (i) collaborating with the People's Association to convert Residents' Network to Active Ageing Centres in the day and (ii) setting up volunteering opportunities for seniors.,1,138,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00138

2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health),"To do so, we need to strengthen our ageing infrastructure in the community.

2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health),"For example, to outreach to seniors more effectively and extensively, we need to tap on all community volunteers, whether they are from the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) or PA.

2023-07-04-T-007,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her reply. With regards to my Parliamentary Question, I actually asked about whether we can convert the Residents' Network (RNs) into AACs, especially during the day. And I would like to ask will the Ministry possibly study this of converting such RNs to AACs and maybe study its impact on promoting active ageing for seniors.",1,146,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00146
2023-07-04-T-007,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"My second question is in relation to setting up volunteering opportunities for our seniors, which the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned earlier. Can she elaborate on what types of volunteering activities will be made available and how do we ensure these opportunities are suitable and accessible for the seniors of varying abilities?",2,147,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00147
2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the RNs are intended to be satellites for the AACs to reach out to more seniors.

It will really depend on the different areas because we are looking at where there are gaps, and we are trying to fill in those gaps.",1,148,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00148
2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,We will be providing funding for the AACs to run the active ageing programmes. This is something that we will definitely keep track of.

2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"In respect of the volunteer opportunities, the Silver Volunteer Fund that I mentioned is intended to create a diverse range of senior-centric volunteering opportunities and this can include opportunities to do mentoring to high-risk youths from low-income families and also, to help caregivers of special needs children with art and music therapeutic programmes. AACs are also volunteering opportunities for the seniors to organise the active ageing programmes for fellow seniors and reach out to those seniors who are in isolation.",4,151,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00151

I would like to ask, typically, the participation at AACs is by mostly women compared to men. I would like to ask what are MOH's plans to drive higher participation rates amongst senior men, especially since there are higher cases of isolation among senior men.",1,154,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00154
2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"This is indeed the problem that many of us face. We do not have the monopoly on the ideas on this; in fact, that is why we are working very closely with partners, as well as with the different communities to understand what the different demographics or interest are. Perhaps, with this collaboration with partners on the ground, we will be able to come up with activities that will attract these seniors.",1,155,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00155
2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We are also trying to bring in these seniors to bring out their other friends, so perhaps, that is also one way to enhance participation from those who have not traditionally included themselves in these activities.",2,156,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00156

2023-07-04-T-007,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"She touched much on the help from volunteers and volunteer networks. Can I just weigh in to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, is MOH confident of the current manpower resourcing, staff resourcing of our AACs, given their role that MOH has given them, as in charge of cluster support? Particularly, they need to do extensive house visits to outreach to many units and a lot of these seniors may not be as amenable to their neighbours to visit the AACs on a regular basis. They may want to keep to themselves, for example, as I have said in the speech during the Healthier SG Motion and also, in light of the obligations that the AACs will have to undertake to support the Healthier SG.",2,159,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00159

2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We do have very good partners on the ground who have been around for a long time and have built relationships with the seniors, so we will be tapping on that expertise. But capability will continue to be built and we need to do so, especially in light of Healthier SG as we reach out to more people. As mentioned, the effort is also in tapping on community volunteers and partners. That is why it is so important to work with grassroots, with partners on the ground and also to bring in seniors who are already connected and convert them to be volunteers themselves, so that they can also reach out.",2,161,2023-07-04-T-007-S-00161
2023-07-04-T-007,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"I think this is a whole-of-community effort and we will definitely have to reach out for different ideas.

2023-07-04-T-008,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Transport in each of the last three years (a) how many complaints has the Ministry received from insured parties about the counterparty failing to file an accident report when involved in a road traffic accident; and (b) what are the remedies available to victims of road traffic accidents who are unable to pursue insurance claims due to the counterparty failing to file an accident report.,1,163,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00163

2023-07-04-T-008,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Please proceed.,1,166,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00166
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, in the last three years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) have received 12 complaints and one complaint respectively, from insured parties about the counterparty failing to file an accident report with their insurer after being involved in a road accident.",1,167,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00167
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA)'s Motor Claims Framework (MCF) sets out the procedures for all accidents to be reported to the insurer within 24 hours or by the next working day, which is incorporated as a condition of all motor insurance policies. The procedure is not, however, mandated legislatively.",2,168,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00168
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Notwithstanding the above, under the Motor Vehicle (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act, an insurer cannot refuse liability on the ground that the policyholder has not reported the accident. I repeat  an insurer cannot refuse liability on the grounds that the policyholder has not reported the accident if the third-party's claim is for bodily injury or death. Victims of road traffic accidents who remain unable to pursue insurance claims can file a civil claim against the counterparty or claim compensation from their own insurer.",3,169,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00169
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Ministry of Transport (MOT), LTA and MAS will work with other relevant Government agencies and GIA to review and, if necessary, strengthen the requirements for reporting road traffic accidents to insurers.",4,170,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00170

2023-07-04-T-008,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I thank the Minister for his reply. The reason why I raised this question was because recently, at a Meet-the-People Session (MPS), a resident approached me for help on this matter. Obviously, he had gotten involved in an accident. I do not believe that there was any personal injury case, but there was obviously damage to the vehicle. He was actually told at the time that nothing could be done if the counterparty failed to file an accident report with his insurance company and, therefore, the only action he could take was a civil suit.",1,172,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00172
2023-07-04-T-008,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"But obviously, as you know, going to Court and all of that can be stressful. It is time consuming and also, even though it might be the Small Claims Tribunal, it is intimidating and it can also be costly in a way. I am just wondering whether there is anything else that can be done even though we note that only 12 complaints were received about this; whether there is anything else that can be done to prevent this from happening.",2,173,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00173
2023-07-04-T-008,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Again, I do not know if the Ministry has any further data about how widespread this problem is because it might be that no official complaints were filed and this practice has been done. There was also an article to the Forum page recently about this matter. So, obviously, this is happening, and I am just wondering what else can be done to assist the motorists who actually find themselves in this unfortunate situation.",3,174,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00174
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I thank the Member for her question. If I may layer my response, first, as the Member has observed herself, at least insofar as the number of complaints are concerned, it is a relatively small number, which suggests that, by and large, motorists do report these incidents, and it is partly because the incentive is there for them to do so; because if they do not, and if it were to come to pass that their insurer discovers this and it is a violation of the contractual condition, then there is a risk of losing the insurance contract.",1,175,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00175
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, a civil suit is obviously one solution and remedy available. There is a spectrum of other options available to the aggrieved party. This includes, of course, claiming from their own insurer which I know is not necessarily an ideal outcome, but it does address the substantial financial loss. However, it does mean that the no-claim bonus and so on might be affected in that regard.",2,176,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00176
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Amongst the GIA, there is a facility where such cases are referred to. And where the cases are assessed to be meritorious, there is also compensation available in that regard.",3,177,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00177
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, to reiterate the point that I made earlier, we will study this further with MAS and with the industry and others to see if there is a need for further tightening in this regard to safeguard the interests of motorists, as the Member has highlighted.",4,178,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00178

2023-07-04-T-008,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. I also have a resident who is in the same predicament. I think the larger issue here is that if there is no viable means right now to take the culprit to task, what kind of message are we sending out to motorists that they can simply get away with something like this and not be responsible if they do not report it?",1,180,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00180
2023-07-04-T-008,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"So, my question is  if the victim has got the personal particulars or NRIC number of the person who is the culprit, can we submit that detail to LTA for their assistance to put some pressure on the person? Because, rightfully, LTA is in charge of the licence of the vehicle that this person is driving. So, is there some assistance that we can get from LTA regarding these matters?",2,181,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00181
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her suggestion. I appreciate the spirit and intent of her suggestion, but we do have to bear in mind a couple of things in this regard.",1,182,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00182
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The first is that these matters are never undisputed. Usually, there is an element of dispute. So, ex ante, there is no case that just because one party has the details of the other party, it means the other party is the offender or the ""culprit"" – in the words of Member. So, any action taken by any Government organisation in terms of investigation or follow-up has to be meritorious, has to be on the basis that there are facts disclosed that point to that.",2,183,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00183
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, the key point here is, first, the incentives are actually there, by and large, for motorists to make such reports in compliance with their contract; because if the insurers were to find that they did not make such a report and subsequently, there are claims made and there is a set of issues, then for the party concerned, the risk is that they stand to lose their insurance cover and, without insurance cover, you cannot drive a vehicle on the roads according to our laws. So, that is a significant thing.",3,184,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00184
2023-07-04-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, as I have said, we will see if there is scope to do anything further by way of mandate or requirements. But again, ultimately, no matter what the mandatory requirements are, the system functions best when all parties concerned are aware of their obligations under the law and fulfil those obligations.",4,185,2023-07-04-T-008-S-00185
2023-07-04-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the tangible outcomes of the grants provided under the SMEs Go Digital programme since it was introduced; (b) how has it helped SMEs in terms of value adding and improvements in productivity; and (c) whether there will be further improvements to enhance the effectiveness of the grants.,1,186,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00186

The report found that SMEs Go Digital grants have added value to SMEs and improved their productivity. For instance, firms which adopted the Productivity Solutions Grant, or PSG, saw overall increases in Value Add Per Worker and revenue. In addition, IMDA's survey showed that 85% of participating SMEs reported time savings, and 75% said digitalisation helped them to alleviate manpower challenges.",2,188,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00188

2023-07-04-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Madam. I read the feature articles on the impact evaluation for the SMEs Go Digital Programme and it was recently included in the Economic Survey Report. It was mentioned that whenever there are tailored solutions, the outcome tends to be better for the SMEs. So, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether in the Digital Enterprise Blueprint that MCI is working on now, are there going to be more emphasis on tailored solutions.",1,193,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00193
2023-07-04-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"My second supplementary question is  it is good that we have all these improvements and outcomes, better value-add to the workers and so on. I want to ask whether the good outcomes are also because of the COVID-19 period where enterprises tend to want to adopt digital means because of the restrictions and whether this momentum will continue now that we are post-COVID-19.",2,194,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00194
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Liang for his two supplementary questions.",1,195,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00195
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"On the first question about the benefits being greater for the SMEs when they use tailored solutions, I will make a couple of observations.",2,196,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00196
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"First, it is our observation as well. It is really because of the state of our digitalisation and transformation efforts in our economy across industries and companies. There is no sector in Singapore that is not touched by digitalisation. However, having said that, the low-hanging fruits or the easy benefits of using digital technology or solutions are largely reaped.",3,197,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00197
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"It is how firms can better use digital technologies by going deeper, transforming their business operations – transforming not just their customer-facing operations, but also how they work with their vendors, partners and supply chains in the broader ecosystem they are in.",4,198,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00198
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Therefore, we have to look at sector by sector. The SMEs in the manufacturing sector will have very different needs from the SMEs in the retail, hospitality or legal profession. That is the reason why we work very hard with the trade associations and partners to develop Industry Digital Plans so that the technology roadmaps, the digital skills recommendations and solutions that are available to those SMEs would be specific to their needs.",5,199,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00199
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Building on this, the Digital Enterprise Blueprint will look at how we can help our companies, including SMEs, deepen their digitalisation and tap on emerging new technologies, like generative AI, cloud-based solutions, while at the same time making sure that they are cybersecure and can also protect their customer data. You can invest a lot in digital solutions but if it is not cybersafe and is subject to cybersecurity attacks – and many of our SMEs are not a target but collateral damage – all the hard work and investment over the many years can be wiped out overnight. So, even as we help our companies digitalise, we will help them to be cybersecure. These will be some of the focus areas for the Digital Enterprise Blueprint over the coming months.",6,200,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00200
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"The second point that Mr Liang asked was about whether COVID-19 has helped to accelerate the pace of digitalisation. Anecdotally, we hear many businesses say that, thankfully, because of their early investment in digital technologies and solutions, they were able to operate even during the COVID-19 pandemic. They had their business continuity plans in place. Their workers and employees could continue to work remotely offsite. They could continue to service their customers and clients remotely – even customers and clients who are not based in Singapore.",7,201,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00201

2023-07-04-T-009,,,"In my conversations with many of the towkays at SMEs, business owners and management of companies, they also indicate to me they are not resting on their laurels. Many of the conversations have shifted at the management level, at the board level, from seeing digitalisation and technology as a cost centre to one of investment in capabilities, investment for greater competitiveness and better productivity for their employees.",2,203,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00203
2023-07-04-T-009,,,"I am very glad these conversations have shifted partly, perhaps, due to COVID-19, but they reinforce the point that we must not lose these gains. We should continue to hasten our digital transformation because, as a system, I believe our ecosystem in Singapore, our business environment, can enable us to be thriving competitive economy that can allow us to create new opportunities for companies and all Singaporeans.",3,204,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00204

2023-07-04-T-009,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I would like to ask Senior Minister of State this  he mentioned about the impact from Chief Technology Officer-as-a-Service (CTO-as-a-Service). It is great to hear that companies are benefiting from CTO-as-a-Service since 2021. Just want to ask the Senior Minister of State since 2021, has there been any learnings from the service and any tweaks, particularly impact, in terms of scaling up and impacting more companies and raising awareness.",1,206,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00206
2023-07-04-T-009,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The second supplementary question is, it is also good to note that the Ministry is tracking the productivity gains of SMEs Go Digital. But does the Ministry also track the mental wellness gains or impacts on the workers in these firms as well? Because I believe that productivity and wellness go hand in hand. So, how does digitalisation also impact the mental wellness of the workers, especially senior workers in these firms?",2,207,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00207
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me take Member Mr Edward Chia's supplementary questions in turn.",1,208,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00208
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Let me address the first one around the CTO-as-a-Service. We launched the CTO-as-a-Service initiative in 2021, that is, about a couple of years ago. The intent was to give SMEs the confidence and convenience to go digital. SMEs, through this platform, can better access their own individual company's digital readiness through a set of checklists, through a set of assessment, maturity assessments, so that they can better choose a set of solutions to work for their needs, tailored to different sectors. If they need to go further, there is a consultancy that they can tap on to get advice on how they can proceed on their own digital transformation journey and a set of resources that are available to them on the platform.",2,209,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00209
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Since the launch, we are very glad to see many more companies coming on board and benefiting from these solutions. In fact, I am heartened to see smaller mom-and-pop shops coming on board, not just the mid-sized companies, but smaller companies who realise and understand the benefits of digitalisation. Through our process of engaging these companies and through the feedback from our consultants who are part of the CTO-as-a-Service consultancy, we have identified areas where we can enhance our programme. This was announced earlier this year as part of MCI's Committee of Supply debate.",3,210,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00210
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"A few things, for example – I would not go through the long list – the Member can refer to our speeches as part of the Committee of Supply debate – but some areas were how we enhanced the platform to incorporate vendor reviews from other user SMEs so that we can improve the quality of the vendors in the platform.",4,211,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00211
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"The second one was to enable SMEs to apply grants through using their Corppass, so that it is more seamless.",5,212,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00212
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"And also, how we put together a panel of consultants appointed by Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) to provide advisory services related to cybersecurity and data protection. Because many SMEs tell us they understand the benefits of digitalisation, but are concerned with cybersecurity attacks and personal data breaches. So, we convened a set of consultants appointed by CSA and PDPA to advise these SMEs.",6,213,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00213
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,These are just some examples how we enhanced the programme and I encourage the Member to look at our speeches in March this year for greater details.,7,214,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00214
2023-07-04-T-009,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"The second question by Mr Edward Chia was around whether we track the mental wellness of the employees. I must say not at this point in that specific set of questions that he asked. But we track the broader indicators. Hopefully, that also correlates to the well-being of the employee. We do not just look at workers hired and the value-added per worker, which is indicative of productivity gains but also, importantly, salary increments, wage increments. And we do track those. I do believe that these are important contributors to a person's mental well-being and emotional well-being.",8,215,2023-07-04-T-009-S-00215
2023-07-04-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Manpower given the recent fatal accident at a demolition site (a) whether there will be additional safety measures for demolition works and additional penalties for infringements given the inherent danger for such construction works; and (b) what are the current penalties aimed at making the leadership of construction contractors accountable in preventing accidents and deaths from happening.,1,216,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00216
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) shares the Member's concerns of the recent fatal incident at a demolition site at Tanjong Pagar on 15 June. MOM is investigating the incident and had issued a full Stop Work Order to the occupier of the worksite.",1,217,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00217
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"There is an Approved Code of Practice – Singapore Standards SS 557 – that sets out standards of practice for the safe demolition of buildings and structures. As investigations are ongoing, we will review if any additional measures are required beyond those in SS 557 and after the investigations have concluded.",2,218,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00218
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"All occupiers and employers have the duty to provide a safe work environment for workers. Penalties under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act are calibrated based on the culpability of the offender and the severity of harm. Higher-risk activities such as demolition works require greater extent of risk assessment and preventive measures. Hence, incidents involving such higher-risk activities would generally attract more severe penalties, if the individual and/or company failed to demonstrate that reasonable steps had been taken to minimise the risk.",3,219,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00219
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"The Multi-Agency Workplace Safety Taskforce (MAST) had also earlier announced a set of Safety Accountability, Focus and Empowerment (SAFE) measures to strengthen WSH ownership across the entire ecosystem at the sectoral, company and worker levels. Chief Executives (CEs) will be required to personally account to MOM for serious WSH lapses following incidents, as was the case for the Tanjong Pagar incident. CEs and Board Directors of all companies in higher-risk industries are also required to attend a new Top Executive WSH Programme. This programme aims to focus their attention on how to meet their WSH responsibilities and develop their company's WSH capabilities.",4,220,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00220

2023-07-04-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his response. Demolition works are high-risk construction activities. Are construction workers trained to recognise tell-tale signs of structural collapse in demolition works and what are the reporting channels for such incidents? And does the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) require having Safety Officers on site to ensure that demolition workers are carried out according to plans by the contractors?",1,223,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00223
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, indeed, works such as these, demolition works are certainly very high risk. And, therefore, that is why we have the Approved Code of Practice, SS 557, in place. All companies involved, from the main contractors all the way down, should be following and training their workers on this practice, Code of Practice. So, therefore, employers are required to train the workers on the demolition process, and this also includes identifying the structural issues that you might see on site.",1,224,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00224
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I am aware that BCA does send its officers down for inspections but given the many demolition works that go on, from the big buildings to the Addition & Alteration (A&A) works, home renovations, for example, it is not possible to have officers all over, so they do this on inspection basis. But under the Code and under regulations, the companies involved should have safety officers and safety procedures in place.",2,225,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00225
2023-07-04-T-010,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, I cannot comment specific to this particular case as investigations are ongoing, but we will release the results once they are ready.",3,226,2023-07-04-T-010-S-00226

Just wondering whether are there any plans to further reach out to our seniors, especially those who are frail and staying alone, especially on assistance such as giving them some healthcare within their home, for example, with diapers. I know that the Senior Mobility and Enabling Fund can be used, but I think we can do more in terms of communications or publicity to get them to understand that these are all assistance that they can actually get. So, I am just wondering whether are there plans to improve our publicity or communications plan?",1,232,2023-07-04-T-011-S-00232
2023-07-04-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Generally, our publicity and communications extend to not just the seniors but also their caregivers. So, the Government undertakes a wide range of communications efforts to raise awareness of the various support schemes available, including what I mentioned just now, the cost-of-living support. For example, the most recent cost-of-living support has been printed in newspapers, like The Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao and on radio capsules, and we have also put them in summary graphics in digital display panels across the Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates and condominium developments. So, these are some of the things that we are doing. I know of grassroots leaders and their partners who are also helping out in other forms of publicity.",1,233,2023-07-04-T-011-S-00233

Data interoperability can also allow contractors and facilities managers to weigh in on the building design at an earlier stage, so that consultants can incorporate considerations for construction and maintenance upfront.

2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, this Bill introduces new planning permissions for buildings and related works and enables building approvals to be processed through the new CORENET X platform.",1,287,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00287
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I commend the Government agencies and the industry for their collaborative approach in creating the new CORENET X platform. The platform streamlines our planning process into a single submission by developers and a coordinated response across agencies. It is a good example of how all stakeholders can work together for better outcomes.,2,288,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00288
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three points of clarification on the Bill.,3,289,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00289
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification is on safeguards for preliminary approvals. Under the new section 5AA of the BCA, plans for any lodgement works are automatically approved without any need for the Commissioner to check the plans. The new section 33E of the EPMA and 46F of the EPHA allow developers to apply for a design certificate to commence preliminary works before getting a clearance certificate for pollution control or public health risks is given. Under the new section 17A of the Planning Act, there is a process to apply for provisional permission to commence works before planning permission is granted.",4,290,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00290
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand it is important to give developers flexibility to commence work early while waiting for final permission. However, once preliminary work has begun, it becomes harder to change course. Would it be difficult for the agencies to refuse final permission, knowing that developers have already incurred expenses? What if rectification costs are too high or not even possible and the damage is already done? Can the Senior Minister of State clarify what safeguards will be taken when giving provisional or preliminary permission to minimise such risks?",5,291,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00291
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification is on the scope of defences under the Bill. Under section 20 of the BCA, the new subsection 1 states that it is a defence to lodging a non-compliant plan if the accused reasonably believed the plans complied with all the prescribed regulations. What would be considered to be reasonable?",6,292,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00292
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Similarly, in the new section 33H of the EPMA, it is an offence to deviate ""in a material way"" from the plans under a clearance certificate. What is the threshold for the deviation to be considered material? Providing guidance and examples on how these terms are applied would be useful for developers to know the extent of due diligence expected.",7,293,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00293
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third and final point is the need to legislate an environmental impact assessment (EIA) framework for all building works. I have raised this a number of times in this House. These updates to planning permissions are commendable but we still have not taken the critical step of introducing a formal EIA law.,8,294,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00294
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"EIA is an essential exercise to ensure that we properly balance the benefits of development to the costs to our environment. Loss of natural spaces and biodiversity adversely affects the lives of all Singaporeans. We not only are denied the enjoyment of natural spaces, we also lose an invaluable resource for combating climate change.",9,295,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00295
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Minister for National Development has previously stated that even though we have no formal EIA laws, the EIA framework is built into the planning approvals and agencies can require an EIA to be undertaken. I also recognise that we are taking steps to centralise EIA requirements under NParks.",10,296,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00296
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),A law to mandate EIA has several benefits over the current case-by-case approach. It creates certainty. Developers would know the cost of falling short. They would be able to plan ahead of time and not need to await some government decision.,11,297,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00297
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Agencies would not need to make as many case-by-case assessments. Singaporeans could be consulted to ensure the law reflects their values and priorities. The law could also contain principles and rules to standardise when and how information gets disclosed, strengthening our Government's principle of transparency.",12,298,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00298
2023-07-04-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I hope the Senior Minister of State can consider these benefits and periodically review our planning framework to consider codifying an EIA law.,13,299,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00299

Moreover, safety codes should be made as simple and visual as possible so that workers can fully comprehend the safety procedure.",14,315,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00315
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, besides skills-based training, employees need to be given awareness-based training to be able to confidently report safety risks. Awareness-based training tackles the impact of work pressure resulting in the compromise of safety boundaries. It would be key to follow safety procedures and draw attention to the importance of doing so.",15,316,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00316
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"On an everyday basis, one way could be using the pointing and calling method which we commonly see in Japanese companies, where every safety step taken is loudly stated, verbalised or called out. This helps to increase focus on the safety measures taken.",16,317,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00317
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"On a more structural level, companies must set up adequate procedures for reporting to ensure that workers understand that safety is crucial.",17,318,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00318
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The Industrial Safety and Health Act in Japan, for example, obliges employers of work sites with 50 or more employees to establish a safety committee which must meet at least once a month, with half of the members nominated by a representative of the employees.",18,319,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00319
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"While Singapore has similar regulations, the law in Japan requires the committee to circulate an agenda to all employees and provide opportunities to hear workers' opinions on matters related to workplace safety and health. This ensures that the opinions of the employees are reflected in the safety and health measures undertaken by the employer.",19,320,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00320
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, the Government, of course, needs to regulate construction companies by invoking appropriate punishments to compel companies to ensure a safe working environment.",20,321,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00321
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There is a framework for doing that, and that is done. While there is a Safety Disqualification Framework, though, to disqualify contractors with a certain number of demerit points from Public Sector's construction tenders, the demerit points framework has room to be tightened further.",21,322,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00322
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Companies have the leeway to accumulate a few breaches in safety before being disqualified from tenders. A company would have to accumulate three full stop work orders or to have major injuries or the death of one person before there is a disqualification of three months from entering into tenders.,22,323,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00323
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"While company directors can be prosecuted under section 48 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act, we have not seen prosecutions of company directors arising from the many workplace safety incidents that have happened, generally speaking. Instead, it is companies that are penalised, without the individuals responsible being punished.",23,324,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00324
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"If workplace accidents are not reduced significantly as a result of the other measures being taken, this should be reviewed.",24,325,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00325
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Apart from looking into major workplace safety concerns, there are also issues of concern with heat, especially with our rising temperatures amidst climate change.",25,326,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00326
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Construction workers are disproportionately affected because they have to wear heavy safety gear like helmets and thick rubber boots, which trap huge amounts of heat. Migrant workers lack access to cooling technology because they work outdoors and at times in remote areas. During hot spells, there is also, generally speaking, no ""Stop Work Order"", with companies being able to insist that workers continue to work in temperatures that are much higher than normal.",26,327,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00327
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The hon Minister for Manpower shared in May this year that MOM conducts targeted inspections to check on-site measures and acclimatisation programmes for workers. In addition to inspections, we can look more into the way construction sites are built.",27,328,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00328
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There should be access to shaded areas and access to water facilities and even perhaps access to air-conditioned rest areas, whether from the work site or nearby areas. For instance, construction sites can tie up with nearby shopping malls or office buildings to provide air-conditioned spaces for rest.",28,329,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00329
2023-07-04-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, as we enjoy the fruits of the labour of our migrant workers who toil to maintain our living environment, let us never forget that they live here too, and they deserve the highest level of gratitude and protection from Singapore.",29,330,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00330

2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. This Bill gives agencies the authority and means to streamline regulatory processes through CORENET X.",1,332,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00332
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"The built environment sector professionals I spoke to look forward to a CORENET X that can bring about improved efficiency and faster approvals. They also hope CORENET X can become the digital foundation for the entire sector in the future. This is a huge undertaking, a critical part of our built environment sector's transformation.",2,333,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00333
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),Some large architecture firms have been working with our agencies on CORENET X through industry consultations and feedback sessions. It is likely that MND has factored in their views.,3,334,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00334
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Therefore, I am here to share the feedback of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) architecture companies that use CORENET often, as well as some main contractors who use certain features of CORENET. The four key feedbacks I have heard are as follows.",4,335,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00335
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"One, built sector professionals would like to know more about how agencies will come together to approve the key gateways, specifically the Design Gateways, Construction Gateways, as well as the OP/Stat Completion stage.",5,336,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00336
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Today, architects seek approval from agencies, which may take time depending on complexity. For example, agencies may take a while to approve a change in the Building Plan when an undocumented gas or water pipe is found in a brownfield development.",6,337,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00337
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Currently, the industry may continue working on the project, even as they are waiting for that one or two agencies' approval at the building plan level. For example, from the National Parks Board (NParks) on relocating of trees, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on fire safety for the design of a stairwell.",7,338,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00338
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"The question is  in the future, do all agencies need to sign off at a particular gateway before one can commence work? What happens when there is an unexpected site condition, which is common in brownfield developments, is discovered and requires a minor amendment? Will they need to get all the agencies to approve the revised design? If so, would getting all agencies to sign off lead to longer delays?",8,339,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00339
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Two, can MND clarify whether the built sector can continue to make 2D submissions, or will the entire industry be asked to move to Building Information Modelling (BIM)? If so, what is the rough timeline? And if not, does the regulatory process differ for 2D and BIM submissions.",9,340,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00340
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Most professionals agree that BIM is the future, but not everyone can use it yet. Smaller firms continue with 2D submissions. For our SMEs, the issue is cost, not technology.",10,341,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00341
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Our SMEs can upgrade their software to do BIM and many professionals have the basic skills, but SMEs need to invest in training and to redesign their processes. I am happy to hear the new productivity solutions that have been announced.",11,342,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00342
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),SMEs can also outsource BIM creation to overseas companies in the Philippines or Indonesia. This cost is justified if they can really benefit from productivity improvements. Or the cost will simply be passed to the end-user.,12,343,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00343
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),But I believe our agencies also need time to fully re-engineer the process and also to get CORENET functionalities and infrastructure ready especially for industry wide adoption.,13,344,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00344
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Therefore, I believe a staggered timeline is needed to get the industry to adopt BIM and CORENET X. It will be ideal if MND can publicly set a desired timeline, but also adjust the milestones depending on how fast our agencies get fully ready, and for our industry to acquire the capabilities.",14,345,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00345
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Three, MND must pay special attention to the CORENET X roll-out to ensure it goes well. Several years ago, the industry experienced difficulties during the initial roll-out of CORENET 2. This includes server downtime and issues with Singpass login. For CORENET X, given how important it is to the industry, MND should work hard to avoid the same issues.",15,346,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00346
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Four, there is great potential for MND to use CORENET X to accelerate approval efficiency, by resolving bottlenecks. Using data garnered from CORENET X applications and approvals, agencies can jointly identify solutions to common but complex building designing issues. MND will also know if agencies have insufficient staff strength to process approvals, because they now see the data from all agencies, and MND can work with them to close the manpower gap. Doing so will benefit the built sector tremendously.",16,347,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00347
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"To conclude, there is a proverb  ""If you want to go fast, run alone; if you want to go far, run together."" This rings true for CORENET X, and I believe MND is committed to co-creating CORENET X with the industry. Today's debate on the bill is an important step to getting CORENET X ready, and to increasing the built sector's knowledge of it. Therefore, I hope MND can answer some of the questions that I have raised on behalf of the SMEs within the built sector.",17,348,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00348
2023-07-04-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Notwithstanding my questions, I support the amendments to the Bill.",18,349,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00349

2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Louis Ng, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Henry Kwek for the support for the Bill and the new CORENET X system.",1,351,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00351
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Let me now address the issues that they have raised earlier. I will start with the points regarding the redesigned regulatory process under CORENET X.,2,352,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00352
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"To recap, there will be three key submission gateways at the design, construction and occupation and completion phases. At each gateway, project teams will need to consolidate the critical project requirements and submit them for approval. Agencies will then work together to provide a consolidated and coordinated response to project teams. Project teams can then proceed with the relevant works after each gateway is cleared.",3,353,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00353
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"This streamlined process will minimise abortive works later, by ensuring that key parameters associated with each gateway are jointly reviewed by agencies, before works proceed.",4,354,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00354
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"So, for the specific examples raised by Mr Louis Ng, the design certificates under the Environmental Protection and Management Act or EPMA, and Environmental Public Health Act or EPHA, and the provisional permission under the Planning Act, would only be granted after agencies have jointly assessed that the key environmental and planning parameters for the project are in order at the Design Gateway.",5,355,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00355
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"This would give project teams greater assurance to commence some preliminary works, without needing to wait for agencies' approvals of the detailed building design at the Construction Gateway.",6,356,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00356
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Ng also asked about the lodgment scheme under the Building Control Act, or BC Act. This is a business-friendly measure that will provide the industry with expedited approvals for less complex, lower risk building works.",7,357,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00357
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"BCA has observed that the plans submitted by QPs for such works today are usually in order and downstream rectification works are not likely to be required. That said, the Commissioner of Building Control may still require the plans to be submitted for approval if he or she views that they are not fully compliant. This provides a safeguard in the event that certain plans will require more detailed review.",8,358,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00358
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Henry Kwek asked if there would be delays due to the consolidated approvals from agencies at the various gateways. On the contrary, this new process should help project teams save time. As mentioned, this should reduce abortive works, as agencies would jointly review the plans and resolve any conflicts upfront. QPs would no longer need to keep adjusting their plans, to reconcile and address different requirements from different agencies at multiple points of the approval process.",9,359,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00359
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"In addition, we will establish service standards to ensure that agencies provide timely responses to project teams at each gateway. At the Design and Construction Gateways, agencies are expected to respond within 20 working days for most submissions. At the Occupancy Permit and Statutory Completion Gateway, agencies are expected to respond to applications for Temporary Occupation Permits, or TOP, and Certificates of Statutory Completion, or CSC, within seven working days from the date of their respective inspections.",10,360,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00360
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Let me move on to the next issue around the implementation of CORENET X.,11,361,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00361
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"I fully agree with Mr Kwek that CORENET X involves significant changes, both for the agencies and the industry. Hence, we will need to ensure a smooth transition from the existing CORENET platform. That is why we have worked with the industry on sandbox projects to test out and refine the new features and processes.",12,362,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00362
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"We will onboard users in phases and roll out features progressively and make adjustments as necessary. We will first work with partner firms to test out the new features from the soft launch in December 2023, before gradually accepting more submissions on a voluntary basis. Agencies will also provide helpdesk support as CORENET X is progressively rolled out.",13,363,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00363
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"We are also paying special attention to the needs of our SMEs, as mentioned by Mr Kwek. In particular, we are helping them make the shift from 2D submissions to Building Information Modelling, or BIM, submissions.",14,364,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00364
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"As I had mentioned earlier, local SMEs will be able to receive co-funding support for BIM authoring solutions and training programmes for CORENET X under the Productivity Solutions Grant, or PSG. We plan to implement this PSG support within the next few months. I encourage our SMEs to tap on the support available and start your BIM journey as soon as possible.",15,365,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00365
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Let me touch on the remaining points raised by Mr Louis Ng.,16,366,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00366
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"First, on the new section 20(1A) of the BC Act. This provision allows for an accused to argue that they reasonably believed that the plans lodged were compliant with the necessary requirements.",17,367,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00367
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"In each case, whether the defence is made out would depend on the specific facts, such as the qualifications and experience of the accused, the nature of the work, and other relevant factors.",18,368,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00368
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Second, on the new section 33H of the EPMA, this provision stipulates that it is an offence to carry out controlled works that deviate in any material way from approved plans. The intent is to ensure that the works are carried out according to approved plans in order to prevent pollution.",19,369,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00369
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"NEA will determine whether to pursue any enforcement action based on the facts of each case. Whether a deviation is considered material would depend on the circumstances of the case including, but not limited to, prevailing requirements under NEA's codes of practice and legislation.",20,370,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00370
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Both BCA and NEA will conduct formal investigations and examine the facts of the case carefully, before embarking on any enforcement action under these provisions.",21,371,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00371
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Third, on the need for Environmental Impact Assessment, or EIA, legislation. This is not within the scope of the Bill, but let me briefly clarify nonetheless.",22,372,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00372
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Environmental considerations are already integrated into our planning process. As part of the planning approval process, development projects near sensitive areas such as Nature Reserves, Nature Areas and other areas with significant biodiversity, marine, and coastal areas undergo in-depth consultation with relevant technical agencies on the expected impact on the environment.",23,373,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00373
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"If the impact on the environment could be significant, agencies will ask for an environmental study to assess in greater detail the full impact and develop more mitigation measures to minimise the impact of the development.",24,374,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00374
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"EIA reports are also made publicly available online, unless there are reasons to maintain confidentiality, such as security considerations.",25,375,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00375
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Projects are also subject to existing regulatory standards by various agencies, which developers should be aware of.",26,376,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00376
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"So, we will continue to study ways to enhance the EIA framework, such as the ongoing pilot to centralise the management of EIA consultancy services for the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and JTC projects under NParks.",27,377,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00377
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Let me now move on to Mr Leon Perera's comments on migrant worker safety. This is also not within the scope of the Bill but let me briefly respond.,28,378,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00378
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,The safety of our workers is a priority for all of us in the built environment sector. Mr Perera may not have been in the Chamber when the Parliamentary Question was answered this morning. This is the question raised by Mr Yip Hon Weng. The Senior Minister of State for Manpower Mr Zaqy Mohamad had also given a fairly comprehensive reply to Mr Yip. Let me just touch on a few points.,29,379,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00379
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Workplace safety is an important priority for us. When accidents happen, it is an opportunity for us to reflect, learn and see how we can do better as an industry, as a sector. Every fatality is a tragedy that we hope to avoid for future building works.",30,380,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00380
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"This culture, this safety mindset is in line with our entire effort to transform the way we build in Singapore. Many of the efforts under the refreshed build environment Industry Transformation Map (ITM) would not only raise productivity, but also improve workplace safety and put workers' safety at the centre of what we do. For instance, using robotics and automation, we reduce both the need for manual labour as well as the safety risk for workers. Our shift towards pre-fabrication using Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) technologies will move more construction work from worksites into factory-like settings. This can lead to better worker safety outcomes, with fewer workers deployed on site.",31,381,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00381
2023-07-04-T-014,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"The Government will lead by example. As mentioned by Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad earlier in the reply to the Parliamentary Question, the  Multi-Agency Workplace Safety Taskforce (MAST) was set up in May this year. Agencies will place greater emphasis on safety considerations in tender requirements and evaluations.",32,382,2023-07-04-T-014-S-00382

In comparison, a 2019 review by the National Council of Social Service in Singapore estimated that about 3% of Singapore's population of men and women experienced some form of domestic violence based on administrative data, but this ranges from 3% to 20% based on self-reported data. While these numbers are lower than global rates, we must aspire as a society to see that no one suffers from family violence.",2,405,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00405

Besides physical and sexual abuse, emotional and psychological abuse, such as exerting control over another's behaviour or victim blaming, is also a form of violence. While such abuse may be less visible or less understood, the harm that it causes to the survivor is no less significant.",4,407,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00407
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Another reason why family violence is complex is because there is no single cause of family violence. The Intergenerational Transmission of Criminality and Other Social Disadvantages, otherwise known as INTRACS study, conducted by MSF and National Council of Social Service (NCSS), suggested that family violence tends to co-occur with negative life experiences and other factors, such as prior contact with child protection and welfare or criminal justice systems and early marriage and parenthood before the age of 21. Hence, the reasons for committing violence could be due to deep-seated issues, such as perpetrators themselves being abused or being a witness to violence in their own homes as a child or an inability to cope with stressors, such as unemployment, financial difficulties, parenting or other issues. Medical or mental health conditions, addiction issues or disabilities may also impact one's ability to manage emotions in a healthy way.",5,408,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00408
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The third cause as to why family violence is complex is because it often happens behind closed doors which makes it harder to detect. Survivors may hesitate to seek help due to shame, stigma, fear of breaking up their family and the perception that family violence is a personal matter. Similarly, individuals who observe family violence may remain as passive bystanders because they also consider it a private family matter.",6,409,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00409

Mrs B and her son had also suffered serious physical abuse from Mr B. Due to the immense fear of Mr B's threats, Mrs B was afraid to apply for a PPO against her husband as it might result in her being chased out of the house and separated from her child.

Unmarried persons aged 18 to below 21 years old will no longer need to rely on guardians, relatives, persons responsible for their care or persons appointed by the Minister to apply for a PPO on their behalf. The new section 63 also removes the need for them to act through a litigation representative. These amendments ensure that survivors receive timely legal protection.",31,434,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00434

This is in addition to Counselling and Domestic Exclusion Orders, which are already available. The perpetrator who is subjected to a Stay Away Order cannot enter or remain in areas frequented by the survivor, such as a workplace, or a childcare centre where the survivor has enrolled their child. A No Contact Order prohibits visits or communications with the survivor. The Court will make these orders if it is satisfied that it is necessary for the safety and protection of the survivor.

Protectors are persons with suitable qualifications and experience who are appointed by the Director-General of Social Welfare to carry out statutory duties and functions under the new Part 7. Under the new sections 62 to 62C, protectors will be able to issue Emergency Orders on site in high-risk cases. In line with the Taskforce's recommendation, this will better protect the survivors at the onset of violence while further action is taken to ensure their safety, such as applying for a PPO or an Expedited Order or putting in place a safety plan.",37,440,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00440

Though he was safe, he had to live apart from his mother and stepsiblings whom he wanted to continue living with. In such cases, an Emergency Order would be issued to Mr D's stepfather immediately at the scene, restraining him from committing further violence. A Domestic Exclusion Order could also be issued to prohibit Mr D's stepfather from being at home, thus, ensuring Mr D's safety while allowing him to continue living with his mother and stepsiblings.",39,442,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00442

As a safeguard, Protectors will be limited to making up to four Emergency Orders against a given perpetrator within three months. This period would give sufficient time for social service professionals to de-escalate the tension, put in place a safety plan for the survivor, provide the necessary intervention and allow the survivor to apply for a PPO.",40,443,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00443

He starved her, did not allow her to shower or to make noise when he was stressed with his studies. He also hit her face and assaulted her private parts with a metal padlock and with his knee. Despite being hospitalised multiple times for serious injuries and being placed in a safe house, Mdm Y insisted on returning home. As she did not want to implicate her son, she did not attribute the injuries to his conduct. She also did not retaliate whenever he took out his frustrations on her.

However, as seen in Mdm Y's case, not all survivors will choose to keep themselves safe, sometimes due to the perpetrator exerting undue influence over the survivor. Allowing protectors to apply for PPOs and other orders on behalf of a survivor will strengthen the protection for survivors whose safety is seriously threatened but who refuse to apply for a PPO.",45,448,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00448

The protector may make a Police report if there is a breach of the PPO or the Domestic Exclusion Order. A breach of these orders is an arrestable offence. In addition, if there is reasonable suspicion that the PPO or Domestic Exclusion Order has been breached with harm inflicted on the survivor, the protector may also apply for Electronic Monitoring for her son.

DVERT will be empowered to issue emergency orders at the scene to require suspected offenders to leave domestic premises immediately and stay away for up to 14 days, while the victim applies to Court for protection orders.",1,503,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00503
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Bill also gives the Court powers to issue a broader range of orders in domestic violence situations. In addition to the traditional orders, such as the personal protection order (PPO), expedited order (EO) and domestic exclusion order (DEO), the Court will additionally be able to issue ""Stay Away Orders"" to require offenders not to go to places where the victim will frequent, for example, workplaces. The value of this cannot be overstated if we recall a past incident in 2004 when an offender confronted his spouse at her workplace at Tuas and killed her there. Another new form of Court order is the ""No Contact Order"" that will protect the victim from being harassed by the offender, not just physically but through other means of communication.",2,504,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00504
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another aspect of the Bill is more effective monitoring of orders issued, for example, possibly requiring those subject to orders to wear electronic monitoring devices. I believe that such certainty of detection will deter breaches of Court orders.",3,505,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00505
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Besides the contents of the provisions, MSF has also reviewed feedback from the public and consulted many stakeholders, including Family Service Centres, crisis shelters, healthcare workers and lawyers.",4,506,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00506
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Having considered all these, the Workers' Party (WP) supports the Bill. That said, I have two concerns that I wish to raise.",5,507,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00507
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the Bill makes it clear that MSF is the lead Ministry on domestic violence, with the Police and MHA playing a somewhat secondary role. For instance, my understanding of the 24-hour DVERT is that it will be staffed by MSF, with the Police coming along to attend cases. Furthermore, any emergency orders issued by DVERT will not be issued by the Police, but by MSF officers. This apparent secondary role for the Police leads me to worry that calls for Police assistance in domestic situations, however serious, may be passed on to MSF automatically or risk being no-crimed in the Police records. This would not be justifiable.",6,508,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00508
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Let me illustrate my concern with scenarios. Suppose a report is received that a person has threatened to harm his or her spouse with a knife and, upon agencies arriving at the scene, the presence of the knife is confirmed. This scenario should properly be classified as criminal intimidation, which is an arrestable offence. Or take another example. Someone calls for assistance due to domestic violence and, upon arrival, the response team sees that the injury is serious and may be a case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, another arrestable offence.",7,509,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00509
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In these scenarios, would the Police handle the matter as it would normally do if the parties were unrelated to each other, that is, classify the cases accordingly as criminal intimidation and voluntarily causing grievous hurt, arrest the suspect and possibly charge the person in Court with the appropriate offence under the Penal Code? Or would DVERT see it as basically a case of family violence to be proceeded with under the Women's Charter, thereby inadvertently downgrading the seriousness of the incidents?",8,510,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00510
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, the fundamental clarification I am seeking is this  in domestic cases where arrestable crimes have likely been committed, can the Government assure the public that the Police will follow the usual criminal processes and not simply leave it to MSF to handle such cases under the Women's Charter?",9,511,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00511
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second clarification I have is on the tremendous demand on manpower that the provisions will entail. The explanatory statement to the Bill has confirmed that the Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained. Has MSF projected how many more staff will be needed to implement the provisions of this Bill? Some of the provisions will entail round-the-clock teams, such as DVERT. They also need to be highly trained, as attending to such cases will involve tense situations and may expose officers to physical danger. As for the Police, they are expected to support DVERT's work. We are all aware of the longstanding manpower challenges at frontline policing. How does the Government intend to meet the significant manpower demands that the Bill entails?",10,512,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00512
2023-07-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, that said, the Bill is a significant commitment towards improving the response of agencies to cases of family violence. I hope it will work well.",11,513,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00513
2023-07-04-T-016,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.,1,514,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00514
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, this Bill aims to better protect survivors of family violence. It will strengthen our ability to intervene in family violence and allow for stronger enforcement against breaches of protective measures.",1,515,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00515
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have seen the consequences on lives when our measures fall short of protecting families. I hope these amendments will allow us to act quickly and more proactively to keep families safe.,2,516,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00516
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have five points for clarification.,3,517,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00517
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first set of clarifications are on the manpower needed for implementation and enforcement. The increased protection and enforcement powers under the Bill will require trained manpower. The Bill creates the position of a protector, who holds significant powers. A protector can make an emergency order before a Court order is obtained, can remove an individual from their residence and can apply for protection orders and other family violence orders. The protector must be sensitive to the needs of family violence survivors, be able to make decisions with limited information and make quick decisions that balance the interests of all parties involved.",4,518,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00518
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The new section 65(2) provides that only the Director-General may appoint any person with suitable qualifications and experience as a protector. Can the Minister of State clarify the qualifications and experience required of a protector? Can the Minister of State share what training will be introduced for protectors?,5,519,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00519
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Beyond creating the position of the protector, can the Minister of State share whether there is sufficient current manpower to implement the expanded powers under the Bill? If not, what is the shortfall and what are MSF's plans to make up for this shortfall?",6,520,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00520
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification is on the individuals covered under the protection order. The new section 60A allows the Court to make a protection order if an aggressor has committed or is likely to commit family violence against an individual. When such a protected individual is the guardian or parent of minor children or otherwise vulnerable family members, it seems likely that those dependants are likely to be in the same household and face the same threats. It would be burdensome to require fresh applications for the individual's dependants.",7,521,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00521
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister of State clarify whether when a protection order is granted to protect a caregiver of vulnerable family members, should the Court also automatically consider issuing protection orders to protect those vulnerable family members?",8,522,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00522
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third clarification is on the use of electronic monitoring. Section 60C(2) allows the Court to make an electronic monitoring order if necessary for the protection or personal safety of an individual. Given the potential intrusiveness of electronic monitoring, can the Minister of State clarify when electronic monitoring will be deemed necessary?",9,523,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00523
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Bilateral monitoring where both the perpetrator and the survivor are tracked has been used in countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. NGOs have raised to me that this may jeopardise victims' privacy. If victims do not understand how the monitoring is carried out, it may cause unnecessary anxiety about their locations being revealed to perpetrators.",10,524,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00524
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister of State share about the types of electronic monitoring arrangements that will be introduced? Are there any plans to introduce bilateral electronic monitoring? Can the Minister of State share how electronic monitoring will be used to detect breaches of other types of orders under the Bill or other family violence offences? Can the Minister of State also share which agencies or individuals will have access to the data from electronic monitoring? How will this data be shared? And what safeguards will be in place to prevent the abuse the use of such data?,11,525,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00525
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My fourth clarification is on the use of policing to complement protection and other family violence orders. Paper orders may not be sufficient to deter some offenders. Increased monitoring and risk of detection may serve as more practical deterrence. Can the Minister of State share if there are any plans to arrange appropriate levels of policing by the Police to complement protection and other types of family violence orders? For instance, is there a protocol for increased policing by the Police to be automatically arranged where protection or other types of orders are in place?",12,526,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00526
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My fifth and final clarification is on the arrangements to ensure continued protection after an aggressor has served jail term for offences of family violence.,13,527,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00527
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The punishment for a family violence may include imprisonment of 12 months or for aggravated offences,18 months. The imprisonment term serves as punishment for the aggressor. But for survivors of family violence, the imprisonment only protects them for as long as the aggressor is in prison. While the aggressor is in prison, there will be no instances that show the likelihood of the aggressor committing family violence since they are in jail. There may not be any factual basis for the survivor then to apply to Court for a Protection Order or other family violence orders, since there is no recent evidence of the aggressor being likely to commit family violence.",14,528,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00528
2023-07-04-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister of State share how any imprisonment for offences of family violence will affect Protection Orders and other types of family violence orders? What arrangements will be made while this offender is in prison and after the offender's release for the survivor's continued protection? Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",15,529,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00529

2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, as Members of Parliament, we are in a unique position to be not just the voice of our constituents, but to also provide assistance and advice to our fellow Singaporeans who are in need. I am sure this is something which all of us do on a weekly basis during our Meet-the-People Sessions.",1,531,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00531
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In preparing for this speech, I am reminded of a number of victims of family violence and abuse who have sought our assistance and some of the imagery of bruises and injuries sustained from physical violence, the ridiculous verbal and psychological abuses that they have suffered and the trauma and fear that is in our residents' eyes and voice, even as they muster up enough courage to relate some of their experiences to me.",2,532,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00532
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I am thankful to the various agencies including MSF who have done what they can to provide timely assistance to our residents who have sought our help. So, in this regard, I am supportive of this Bill to introduce a more comprehensive regime to protect against family violence.",3,533,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00533
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"To start with, of course, family violence and abuse can take many forms beyond physical hurt and harassment. And this has also evolved with the times and the use of technology, for example. Hence, for starters, I appreciate the updated definition of ""family violence"" under the new section 58B, to cover physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse. This would be a more comprehensive and practical definition rather than the narrow and prescriptive definition previously.",4,534,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00534
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),My speech today will be focused on the need for greater assurance and more timely support for families at risk or are in domestic violence situations.,5,535,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00535
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I recognise the merits of protecting victims through better protections, while enhancing rehabilitation of perpetrators of family violence. The amendments to strengthen protections of victims include the ability for protectors to make personal protection orders (PPOs) on behalf of victims for their safety, to issue emergency orders, lowering the eligibility age to apply for a PPO and better-defined rehabilitative provisions to instruct and prohibit perpetrators from having contact with victims.",6,536,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00536
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Having a second layer of protection through electronically monitoring arrangements also enable enforcement officers to be in a better position to ensure survivors feel and receive a level of personal safety and security. Moreover, the plans to strengthen rehabilitation of perpetrators through counselling and treatment orders are also commendable in allowing families to find and resolve the root cause of domestic violence and abuse.",7,537,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00537
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"On the amendments and new provisions introduced by the Bill, I have a number of queries I wish to clarify with the Minister of State.",8,538,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00538
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Firstly, what are the considerations behind lowering the age of an individual who can apply for a PPO from 21 to 18 under the new section 60 and whether there needs to be an age limit?",9,539,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00539
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Family violence will have far-reaching and traumatic consequences in every aspect of a person's life at any age, whether they are above or below the age of 18. While there is merit in bringing down the age of an individual who can apply for a PPO from 21 to 18, allowing for a larger number of young individuals to seek help, it discounts younger individuals below the age of 18 to take actions to cure a dire situation.",10,540,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00540
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Trauma often force children to mature faster and beyond their years. A 17-year-old going through a similar abusive situation as an 18-year-old will have the same need and want to have that autonomy to decide to protect themselves from domestic violence. Moreover, children from the age of 13 can even take up employment in a non-industrialised setting and some may have had to juggle schoolwork with part-time employment just to supplement the family income.",11,541,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00541
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In cases where someone is under the age of 18, is not married and does not have any other older family member who can file a PPO application on their behalf, to whom can they turn to for assistance? More broadly, how can we ensure that children do not fall through the cracks?",12,542,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00542
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Second, in cases involving a domestic exclusion order, a stay away order or a no contact order under the new section 60B, how can we ensure that there is no financial strain or damage caused to survivors?",13,543,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00543
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While we are moving towards a cashless society, there could be cases where women and children do not have access to the family's finances or do not have friends and extended family they can feel comfortable turning to, with the perpetrator either being unwilling to provide for financial support or simply unable to given that he may be remanded.",14,544,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00544
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thirdly, while I recognise the need to ""break the cycle of violence"" through rehabilitative and treatment provisions, could there be more room to consider the needs and wants of survivors, rather than via the Courts instead?",15,545,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00545
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),This is not to say we do not give offenders a second chance.,16,546,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00546
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While there could be many cases where there is a strong desire on both the perpetrators and survivors to heal the relationship, some may not wish to confront the intimidating and traumatic prospects of repairing this broken relationship. At present, the Court may already require the survivor, perpetrator of family violence and/or their children to attend mandatory counselling.",17,547,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00547
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I am appreciative of the enhanced powers to take timely interventions to safeguard the health and well-being of victims of family abuse. However, I believe that there needs to be a longer-term game plan to prevent family violence in the first place and provide greater lasting support to victims, especially those with psychological trauma and physical displacement.",18,548,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00548
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In 2022, MSF investigated 2,254 new family violence-related cases, while the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline received 10,800 calls for assistance. For every case that is surfaced, there could be many more that are suffering in silence and more who do not know who they can trust or turn to for assistance, particularly when the ones they loved the most turned out to be the ones causing them such intolerable harm.",19,549,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00549
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"More can be done when it comes to public education in building awareness of what constitutes family violence and abuse and to encourage Singaporeans who witness family violence to reach out for assistance. Schools, in particular, should provide greater training and resources to help teachers and staff better identify signs of domestic violence in children.",20,550,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00550
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"For victims of family violence, we need to provide for more structural forms of assistance, longer-term assistance especially, as it relates to psychological trauma or physical displacement.",21,551,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00551
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Often, family violence survivors choose to endure the abuse, instead of reporting their abusers to the Police in fear of either further abuse or being left homeless and vulnerable.",22,552,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00552
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"After all, if one considers Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it is only after physiological needs of food, water, shelter, clothing and a place to sleep are met can one begin to consider safety and security in their family. Survivors of family violence face a very real dilemma when reporting their abusers, as this could also mean a loss of basic needs, especially if the abuser is the sole breadwinner of the family.",23,553,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00553
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"How can we provide a level of psychological safety and support to those suffering in silence, such that they are willing to step out of their fears and to bring attention to their situation? We must recognise that there is an acute need for safe accommodation and timely response once the domestic violence report has been reported to the Police or once the PPO has been filed. We need to ensure that survivors will not feel worse off when they finally break their silence and that adequate support are available and ready for them when they do find themselves in a situation needing them.",24,554,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00554
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In this regard, there should also be a range of long-term support and resources made accessible for survivors, beyond short-term responses to the family crisis.",25,555,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00555
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"These include access to financial and non-financial forms of assistance, such as access to housing, when they have no relatives to turn to for help, timely employment assistance and immigration support. Mental health and psychological support in the form of counselling or therapeutic support is also essential during this trying period.",26,556,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00556
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Particularly for women and children who are not locals and are on long-term visit passes, for example, their right to feel safe and have a safe place to live in is a precarious one without the support of their local spouse, not knowing when they might have to leave this place they call home. And yet, even as they can continue to reside here, their ability to access affordable housing through the Housing and Development Board (HDB) ownership or rentals is also not a given.",27,557,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00557
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),We must therefore recognise that holistic support is vital to enable survivors to complete their journey towards full recovery from family violence.,28,558,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00558
2023-07-04-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Finally, beyond the issue of family violence per se, I wonder, if the heart of the issue is that we are a more violent and abusive society today than before. Road rage cases are increasingly common, the latest high-profile case being that involving a car driving off with a cyclist who laid on the bonnet after a heated argument between the two women involved. Last month, two elderly men were arrested after a fight broke out over cigarette butts in a coffeeshop. And online, we have trolls masquerading behind a pseudonym, spreading hatred, anger, personal attacks and verbal abuse, often in a coordinated and organised manner. Are these behaviours now normalised in society?",29,559,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00559

2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I remember vividly a case which I attended to almost a decade ago when I was a newly called junior lawyer, where a foreign spouse visited the community legal clinic, crying. She shared with me that she had been subjected to her husband's verbal and physical abuse for years. At first, she decided to tolerate the mistreating for the sake of their young children and due to her worry of her husband cancelling the sponsorship for her permanent residency (PR) status to remain in Singapore. However, her husband's treatment towards her continued to worsen, to the extent that he forbade her to step out of the house and would lock her and her children indoors whenever he headed out to work his night shifts. On that particular night when she came to see me, she managed to sneak out of the house and came to my legal clinic to seek advice on divorce, as her mother-in-law, who had a spare key, had come to the flat to visit the grandchildren.",3,564,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00564
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In recent years, there have been increased efforts on the ground to raise awareness on the personal protection order (PPO). More community legal clinics have been set up at places, such as Community Centres across the heartlands and neighbourhoods. Since the COVID-19 period, Pro Bono SG has also begun to offer virtual legal consultations for the convenience of residents who may, due to family circumstances, be unable to attend the legal clinic session in person.",4,565,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00565

2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"At MSF's front, just as what Minister of State Sun shared earlier, we have also seen the establishment of the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (NAVH) and online channels, as well as the setting up of more Family Service Centres and Protection Specialist Centres that encourage victims of family violence to not suffer in silence and to take action in putting things to an end.",6,567,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00567
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"We have also seen more collaborations between the Ministry and the community to raise more awareness in this aspect. One example is our Woodgrove Division's collaboration with the Family Justice Courts last August on the Family Justice @ Heartlands series where several expert panelists, including the Registrar of the Family Justice Courts, a representative from the Rehabilitation and Protection Group from MSF and esteemed lawyers, were invited to come together to share their insights on the holistic support available on protection related matters.",7,568,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00568

However, I would also like to take this opportunity to seek some clarifications.",8,569,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00569
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Firstly, enhancing protections for those who are unable to apply for a personal protection order (PPO) on their own. Under the new amendment, for victims reluctant to report their assailants, the Bill allows the Director-General of Social Welfare to appoint protectors to apply for the necessary PPOs on their behalf as well as to seek the appropriate orders as the protector deems fit to best protect the victim from further harm.",9,570,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00570
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In this regard, I wish to inquire whether such empowerment also applies to victims who are willing but unable to apply due to factors such as age – those that are below 18 – or mental incapacity.",10,571,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00571
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Take, for example, a 16-year-old teenage girl who has been exposed to domestic violence alongside her mother. In an attempt to keep the family intact, the mother refuses to apply for a PPO for herself and her daughter against the father. For cases such as this, to whom can this 16-year-old seek help from if she has no other family members to rely on? Can a protector be activated in such an instance?",11,572,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00572
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"My second point, the workability of certain court orders imposed against the accused perpetrators. Under the new regime, the Court is given additional powers to issue orders such as domestic exclusion – a Stay Away or No Contact order. In typical situations, however, where a husband and wife with limited income are staying under the same roof, imposing such orders may seem either impractical or inconvenient to one party. For example, it forces the perpetrator to move out of the matrimonial home, with no alternate accommodations.",12,573,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00573
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"While I know that MSF provides shelters for victims of family violence, would assistance be also rendered to perpetrators in cases where the Court has imposed such restraining orders as well?",13,574,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00574
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"My third point, the prevention of the abuse of the system. While I am supportive of this new system, how can we ensure that it will not be abused by estranged spouses who are seeking to deprive the other of access to their children while they are in the midst of or in the aftermath of a bitter divorce proceeding?",14,575,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00575
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"It is not too far-fetched to assume that parties with acrimonious marriages may take the opportunity to cause difficulties or disrupt plans if given the ability to do so. In order to ensure that the system remains fair and partial, we will need to ensure that it cannot be manipulated in such a way that spouses can use it as a form of revenge.",15,576,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00576
2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, family violence of any form, be in physical, psychological or emotional, should not be condoned. To those victims out there who are still suffering in silence, hoping that their situation will eventually improve for the better, I urge you to come forward and seek help. To those who think that by obtaining a PPO, it will increase your chance to obtain sole custody, care and control rights of your children, I urge you to think twice. Avenues to seek help for family protection under the Women's Charter should be seen as a shield and not as a sword.",16,577,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00577

2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the amendment Bill. I would like to start by thanking MSF for taking this important step. In particular, I commend the work of MSF and the Taskforce on Family Violence led by Minister of State Sun Xueling and Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim for the comprehensive recommendations in the task force's report of 2021. MSF has been in extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including crisis shelter homes like Casa Raudha, which provides interim protection for vulnerable women and children facing family violence.",1,580,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00580
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Over the years, we have seen various legislative enhancements and steps to raise awareness on this important issue, one which lies close to my heart. I thank Minister of State Sun for stating in her Second Reading speech just now that MSF may consider, in the future, if it is necessary, for a standalone domestic violence bill to better protect survivors who are not in a familial relationship. This is something that I had raised before in this House. For now, this Bill is yet another step in the right direction.",2,581,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00581
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"This Bill allows protectors to apply for PPO on the survivors' behalf even if these survivors do not want to do so on their own accord. MSF's Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team can also issue an emergency order without the need to go Court. Currently, a survivor must apply in Court for a PPO and at the time of application, be granted an expedited order. Unfortunately, this presents a time gap between the initial incident of family violence and the issuance of the expedited order or a PPO.",3,582,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00582
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"With this Bill, a time limited emergency order can be issued where there is an imminent risk and danger that the perpetrator will commit family violence.",4,583,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00583
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"This is an important development because every survivor faces unique circumstances that may impact their willingness or ability to pursue legal remedies such as a PPO. Some survivors may feel that applying for a PPO may escalate the violence or place them in greater danger while others may not want to involve the legal system for fear of causing the perpetrator to be jailed, thus further complicating the issues with the perpetrator.",5,584,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00584
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I hope a nuanced approach can be taken in exercising this power by the protector to apply for a PPO, especially in cases where survivors are reluctant to do so on their own accord. Legal remedies such as PPOs should be a measure of last resort and only issued when it is assessed that there is high risk that the survivor's safety being compromised.",6,585,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00585
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, it must be remembered that beyond legal redress and intervention, the Ministry and its affiliates, partners and agencies already provide holistic support and resources to meet survivors' needs such as counseling, advocacy and safety planning. I welcome the enhanced support in this regard through this Bill.",7,586,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00586
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"By providing a range of support services that address the unique needs and circumstances of survivors, we can help empower survivors to take control of their lives and make informed decisions about their safety and well-being.",8,587,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00587
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),Another change is that the Bill creates a new protection order that can include a number of provisions such as an order to stay away from the survivor and to have no contact with the survivor. I welcome these changes. Allow me to share a story about a family violence survivor in Casa Raudha called Mdm N.,9,588,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00588
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"She is a foreign bride who suffered spousal abuse and sought refuge with her five-year old son at the shelter through MSF's help. Typically, she will bring her son to work. However, one day, the child's paternal grandfather and paternal aunt came to Mdm N's workplace and took the child without her consent. Even after the matter was reported and the Police interviewed her son and her husband's family, the family refused to cooperate to return the son back to Mdm N. At that time, it was assessed that Mdm N's son was not in any immediate danger while in the company of her estranged husband's family and her husband, and that her husband has every right to have care and control of the son at that time. This separation from her five-year-old son caused a lot of anguish for Mdm N and inflicted on her more pain and hurt than any previous injuries that she had suffered at the hands of the perpetrator.",10,589,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00589
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"With the amendments in this Bill, had a Stay Away or No Contact order been made, such incidents and interventions by other third parties like extended relatives or family members would have been prevented. This would further strengthen the support for family violence survivors and their children.",11,590,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00590
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I thus feel that the amendments in this Bill are timely. The changes may not have come in time for Mdm N, but it would be helpful for other mothers who stand in similar shoes in the future. I thus welcome the changes to this Bill to better protect all survivors of family violence.",12,591,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00591
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),I do have some clarifications.,13,592,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00592
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, I note that the definition of ""family violence"" has been expanded and broadened. Under the current Women's Charter section 64, subsections (a) and (b), the definition of ""family violence"" refers to placing a family member in fear of hurt or causing hurt to the family member. ""Hurt"" in turn means bodily pain, disease or infirmity. There is also an element of intention on the part of the offender, in that the offender must wilfully or knowingly place the family member in fear of hurt or must have caused hurt by an act which is known to result in hurt.",14,593,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00593
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Under the proposed Women's Charter section 58B(2)(a), it is sufficient to constitute family violence if there is a threat to cause personal injury or physical pain, whether or not there is actual hurt or fear of hurt. The element of intention also appears to have been removed as there will be family violence so long as the conduct causes injury or pain.",15,594,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00594
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, I note that this definition of family violence is principally adapted from the definition of abuse in the Vulnerable Adults Act (VAA). The VAA is meant to protect vulnerable adults, that is, individuals incapable of protecting themselves, whereas family violence provisions may apply to all adults, including those who are capable of protecting themselves.",16,595,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00595
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"May I know what is the rationale for these changes? Further, would there be any guidance on how the new broadened family violence definition should be interpreted? There should be clarity to this, given that upon belief that there is family violence or risk of family violence, the protector has wide-ranging powers, including the powers to  (a) assess a victim; (b) enter premises; (c) apply to Court for PPO; and, in high-risk situations, (d) make emergency orders against persons they believe to have committed family violence.",17,596,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00596
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),I turn to the powers of the Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team and the protector. Are there any safeguards against the abuse of such powers?,18,597,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00597
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Where a child is involved, it potentially involves removing a parent accused of being a perpetrator from the child's life. These are drastic orders that are capable of disrupting and impacting children's lives.",19,598,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00598
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"While an emergency order is stated to only have 14 days' validity, under section 62B(8), the protector has the power to issue fresh emergency orders, limited to four emergency orders in three months. Notwithstanding these extensive powers, there does not appear to be any avenue for review or appeal. Can an individual subject to an emergency order apply to Court to cancel or vary the emergency order?",20,599,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00599
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, if all measures are insufficient to protect the family violence survivor, the protector can also apply to Court to remove the survivors for their safety. There is a concern that this would deter survivors from seeking help if they are not ready to move out.",21,600,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00600
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, I humbly suggest that there should be greater public awareness and counselling of families involved to assure them that these measures are of a last resort. This is consistent with the case law in relation to a care and protection order under the Children and Young Persons Act, where such measures are of last resort.",22,601,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00601
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),I also note that there would be the use of e-tagging in deterring family violence. I welcome this. This is something that I had raised in a Parliamentary Question to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on 1 March last year for the use of tagging technology to alert survivors in close range to high risk or violent ex-offending perpetrators. I hope that e-tagging and the use of other technology may act as a deterrence to perpetrators and assurance to survivors of their safety and protection.,23,602,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00602
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, besides punitive measures and deterrence, we must not forget the potential for the rehabilitation of perpetrators. Together with Casa Raudha, Keat Hong Community Centre organises annual talks for men to tackle issues of patriarchal mindsets, toxic masculinity and equal parenting responsibilities in our efforts to end family violence.",24,603,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00603
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In one session, I had the opportunity to speak to a panelist who was a former perpetrator himself. He shared how he was truly repentant and wanted to reconcile with his wife and family. He paid his dues. He sought professional help. He committed himself to a path of atonement and forgiveness from his family. Now, with every passing day, he tries to become a better husband, a better father, a better man. I hope he continues on this path and be an inspiration to others as well.",25,604,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00604
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I welcome the changes to enhance powers for the Court to order counselling and mandatory treatments for perpetrators. I hope that besides working to protect survivors of family violence, we can also continue to consider greater rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts in the future to bring former perpetrators on the path of recovery and rehabilitation, so that one day they can be welcomed back in the lives of those whom they had loved, lost and hurt before.",26,605,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00605
2023-07-04-T-016,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, the amendments in this Bill will strengthen the Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases and empower survivors to better protect themselves. I stand in support of the Bill.",27,606,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00606

2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for the debate and support for the Family Violence (Amendment) Bill.

2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked how the updated definition of family violence should be interpreted. Family violence comprises the broad categories of abuse that our social service professionals typically encounter – specifically, physical, sexual and emotional or psychological abuse. The Bill makes clear the type of conduct or behaviour that amounts to each type of abuse.",2,609,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00609
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Zhulkarnain is right that the definition of family violence looks to the harm caused by the perpetrator, rather than the intention of the perpetrator, and this is deliberate. Survivors should be able to obtain protection against harmful conduct without having to prove what the perpetrator knew or ought to have known. For example, a survivor should be able to obtain a personal protection order (PPO) against a perpetrator who turns violent under the influence of drugs or alcohol, even though he might not fully know the effect of his actions.",3,610,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00610
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Zhulkarnain also asked why the updated definition is adapted from the definition of abuse in the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018 (VAA). Both this Act and the Women's Charter are regimes that aim to protect those experiencing abuse. The profiles of persons they protect are different. For example, the VAA protects those who are incapable of protecting themselves due to mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity and, therefore, the interventions are different. However, the abuse they target is the same. Hence, we have aligned the definitions of abuse in these two regimes. This will help promote a common understanding of abusive behaviour amongst the public, professionals in the social service sector, the Courts and lawyers, and facilitate better detection and identification of acts of abuse.",4,611,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00611
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Ms Hany Soh asked whether Protectors would be able to make applications for PPOs on behalf of survivors, such as those below 18, who are willing but unable to apply for them. Yes, this is already the case, as social service professionals are already empowered to apply for PPOs on behalf of survivors who are below 21 years of age or who are incapacitated.",5,612,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00612
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Chua sought clarification on our rationale for the minimum age of a PPO applicant. All survivors are entitled to receive timely legal protection. Survivors who are aged below 18 may seek assistance from other family members, social service professionals or Protectors, to apply for a PPO on his or her behalf. They can also be accorded the necessary protection and support under the Children and Young Persons Act.",6,613,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00613
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng suggested that the Court automatically grants PPOs for the survivor's vulnerable dependants when the survivor himself or herself is granted a PPO by the Court. Under the new section 60A, the Court will not automatically issue PPOs for an applicant's vulnerable dependants. This is aligned with the current practice and there is a good reason for this. For example, an individual may inflict violence only on the spouse and not on the children. While a PPO application must be made for each family member, and a PPO will be issued if the Court is satisfied that the perpetrator has committed or is likely to commit family violence against each family member and that the protection order is necessary for his or her protection, the Court may give direction for the applications to be heard together and this will help families save time and resources.",7,614,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00614
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,Ms Hany Soh asked if there were measures to prevent estranged spouses from abusing the enhanced family violence regime during divorce proceedings. Access to justice is a fundamental right and all parties must have the avenues to apply for a PPO. But this is not to say that a person can abuse the Court process and make frivolous or vexatious applications.,8,615,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00615
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"As I had mentioned earlier, a PPO is only issued when the Court is satisfied that the respondent has committed or is likely to commit family violence against the applicant or other family member(s) concerned and it is necessary for his or her protection or safety. Otherwise, the Court may dismiss the application. In addition, if the application is frivolous or vexatious, the Court may order costs to be paid for by the applicant. In extreme cases, the Court can make Civil Restraint Orders to restrain a person from bringing further applications without the Court's permission.",9,616,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00616
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked that we consider if family violence re-offenders could be identified, to deter re-offending and to protect others from harm. He also acknowledged that doing so may lead to the identification of the survivor. The purpose of prohibiting publication or broadcast of information that is likely to identify family violence survivors is solely to protect survivors. The intent is to encourage survivors to report family violence incidents without the fear of being publicly embarrassed and to spare survivors who do report such incidents from further trauma.",10,617,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00617

She shared that her ex-husband was being prosecuted for breaching a PPO and her identity was publicly disclosed as it was an open hearing. As it took her great courage to report the family violence, she was worried that her child's psychological well-being would be negatively impacted since her and her ex-husband's names were made known publicly. This amendment would protect Mrs N and her child's identities as the publication of their identities will be prohibited by law, even in the absence of a gag order. Mrs N would also be able to apply to the Court to remove the publication. This will accord Mrs N and her child the space and privacy to recover and heal from the trauma.",11,618,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00618
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The amendment prohibits a perpetrator's identity from being published, only where publication of his/her identity would likely lead to the survivor's identification. However, if the survivor consents to the publication or broadcast of such information that could identify him or her, the Director-General of Social Welfare (DGSW) will regard his or her consent as a highly relevant factor and may decide to grant approval for such publication or broadcast.",12,619,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00619
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng asked about the validity of PPOs following the imprisonment of offenders, and arrangements to ensure the survivor's continued protection during and after the perpetrator's imprisonment. PPOs typically have effect indefinitely and remain in force until revoked. Hence, in most cases, PPOs which are issued before the term of imprisonment will continue to remain in force after the perpetrator's imprisonment. Depending on the circumstances of each survivor, social service professionals may conduct safety planning and provide assistance and support if the survivors need legal advice, shelter or financial support.",13,620,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00620

I would like to assure Mr Chua that MSF and our community partners are committed to supporting survivors. Their well-being is our priority.",14,621,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00621

I agree with them. Protectors, who are authorised by the Director-General to exercise powers under this Bill, are social service professionals who are trained in managing family violence and protection cases and have expertise in trauma-informed care and support. They are committed to ensuring the well-being and safety of families affected by violence and have a keen awareness of the unique needs and challenges faced by the families they serve.",15,622,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00622

2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Zhulkarnain asked about safeguards against the abuse of the Protector's powers and whether there are any avenues to appeal against an Emergency Order. I would like to assure the House that Protectors are trained social service professionals who understand that powers are to be exercised appropriately and judiciously, with the safety and well-being of the survivor as the primary consideration. Emergency Orders issued by Protectors are intended to cover an existing gap. These Orders will be time-limited, to give the survivors time to apply for a PPO from the Court. There is also a limit to the number of times an Emergency Order can be made. Given that Emergency Orders are temporary measures intended to protect survivors facing imminent harm, no appeals will be allowed.",17,624,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00624
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I agree with Mr Zhulkarnain's suggestion that there should be greater public awareness that powers to remove survivors will only be exercised as a last resort.

2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked if the Police would continue to process cases as per usual, if arrestable offences are disclosed. The answer is yes. The Police would continue to address cases as per usual, if arrestable offences are disclosed. In high-risk family violence situations, the Police will jointly respond with the Domestic Violence Emergency Team, or DVET. The Police will continue to handle cases with law-and-order issues. The DVET officers will address immediate safety concerns and refer the families to Protection Specialist Centres for follow-up intervention.",19,626,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00626
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng asked for more details on the Electronic Monitoring Order. As I shared in my opening speech, electronic monitoring will only be imposed on high-risk perpetrators in exceptional cases where there is reasonable suspicion that a PPO has been breached with harm inflicted on the survivor, and the survivor has not taken steps to protect himself or herself. Details of the electronic monitoring regime will be worked out further by MSF.",20,627,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00627
2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng asked if there are plans to arrange for higher levels of policing as a deterrence measure to complement PPOs and the new Court Orders. If we refer to both the Member's earlier clarification on concerns about abuse of the Electronic Monitoring regime and his current suggestion to have more monitoring and policing as a practical deterrence, I think we need to ask ourselves what is the balance that we ought to strike. I would say that we need to put the survivor at the heart of what we do. We want to protect them while ensuring that their privacy is also safeguarded. Thus, our social service professionals will continue to work closely with the Police, including their Family Violence Community Policing Officers, to identify, respond to and monitor cases involving very high-risk family violence. MSF will also continue our public education efforts through the Break the Silence campaign to encourage the community to partner us in detecting, identifying and reporting family violence incidents.",21,628,2023-07-04-T-016-S-00628

2023-07-04-T-016,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"To address family violence at its root requires a multi-pronged, whole-of-society approach.

2023-07-04-T-016,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh,"Since one of the objectives of the Bill is to rehabilitate the perpetrators to restore broken relationships, can I clarify if actually the provisions can also extend to providing the protections to the perpetrators in certain circumstances?

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The last key amendment in 2010 was to advocate for the ""conciliation-first"" approach. This has been effective in reducing the number of cases that have to be put before the Tribunal for resolution. As I mentioned at my Second Reading speech on 9 May, the number of elderly parents who applied to the Tribunal had dropped significantly from 183 in 2010 to 110 within the first year of implementation and the number of applications has since stabilised at about 30 cases a year.",5,655,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00655
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The world has changed quite significantly in the last 12 years. We have also learnt more about the way the Maintenance of Parents Act (MPA) works. So, having reviewed it, our Workgroup opine that it is time for more changes. At the same time, it is important to note what endures and will endure. My workgroup's recommendations are guided by the principles of the MPA.",6,656,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00656
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"First is ""family as the first line of support"".

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"MPA is a necessary last resort to provide legal recourse for neglected parents to get maintenance from their children for their basic needs. It respects the duty of an adult to his parents, and requires that each of us carry this duty, rather than pass it onto our fellowmen, in requiring that the state provides this private care.",8,658,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00658
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Second, is the principle of reciprocity. The obligation imposed on children to maintain their parents is not an absolute one. In circumstances where the parents had abandoned, abused or neglected their children, then it may not be just and equitable for them to be ordered to maintain their parent. Here, where there is no private duty, there is a public one.",9,659,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00659
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, from a survey of over 1,000 respondents that my workgroup commissioned in January to February last year, it is clear that family values remain strong among the majority of Singaporeans. The survey, which is statistically representative of national demographic proportions, found that four in five agreed with the principle of reciprocity, that it is important for the children to repay the care received during childhood to their parents. Similarly, seven in 10 agreed that children have an obligation to care for their elderly parents.",10,660,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00660
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"These findings are consistent with other studies, such as those conducted by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), that the vast majority of Singaporeans hold strongly to family values and agree that it is their duty to take care of their parents regardless of their qualities and faults.",11,661,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00661

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"There is obviously a gap in the argument since the duty to care for one's parents does not arise from an exchange of promises – a baby cannot ask to be born, just as he cannot make a promise to care for his parents. My own position is that this duty exists as a social fact, from the existence and the living out of a family relationship, not from an exchange of promises.",13,663,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00663
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"But this is mere personal philosophy. As a matter of public policy, I want to say that the Act remains as a pillar of our society's position on the role of the family in supporting one another. It serves as a signal to those children who neglect their needy parents who had previously cared for them, that the law holds them liable for maintenance.",14,664,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00664
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The current amendments before us require us to strike the right balance in strengthening provisions for parents, while introducing measures to prevent misuse. That is, we propose to amend the MPA to first, enhance Tribunal/Commissioner's powers in ensuring neglected elderly parents are adequately supported and to put in place new processes to prevent misuse of the MPA by those who did not fulfil their parental duties. This represents an even-handed recalibration for both parties.",15,665,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00665

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"For abuse victims, the mere experience of going through the proceedings under the MPA can be distressing because it involves facing the parent after years of avoidance and recounting the experiences that they had tried to forget.",22,672,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00672
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Indeed, the experience of the parent's abandonment, abuse or neglect has a serious impact on a person's life.

If permission is granted and the case proceeds to a Tribunal hearing that includes the respondents, the Tribunal can still make a finding that the parent had abandoned, abused or neglected the respondent child based on the evidence as provided by the respondent and dismiss the case.",33,683,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00683

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),Subsection (2) will be expanded to enable the Tribunal and the Commissioner to obtain records to verify the truthfulness of the declaration made under new section 3A and to use these records to fairly determine the case.,37,687,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00687
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Some of the information or documents might be subject to gag orders or statutory prohibitions against publication. The amended section 14A(1A) will enable the Tribunal or the Commissioner to obtain these records but only for the purpose of ascertaining whether the parent has a record of abandonment, abuse or neglect of his or her child. These records will obviously have to be treated very carefully after they are obtained. The other amendments to section 14A introduce special safeguards and protections for such information or documents.",38,688,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00688
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In both rounds of public consultation that we conducted, a sizable number of participants had asked for protections to be extended to children who have been abandoned, abused or neglected by their parents, but who do not have official records because the incidents were never reported.",39,689,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00689

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"When I reviewed the MPA in 2010, one of the key thrusts was to ensure that the administrative processes behind the Act are beneficiary-centric, so that any additional or unwarranted stress put on the families should be minimised. At that time, we proposed to give the President and Deputy President of the Tribunal powers to dismiss frivolous or vexatious applications under section 3 of the Act, that is, for ""fresh"" applications.",44,694,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00694

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Currently, the Tribunal has existing powers to dismiss variation applications under section 14(7)(a) of the Act, but a Tribunal quorum is reached only where there are three members present. And this can cause potential inefficiencies and delays. So, we propose to allow frivolous or vexatious variations to be dismissed by the President or a Deputy President, similar to fresh applications.",46,696,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00696

And this can be done where it is already clear from the existing evidence that the application is without merit, for example, where the applicant is clearly financially able to maintain himself or the child clearly has no means to maintain the parent because he himself is receiving long-term financial assistance. Another example would be the application is one that had been previously dismissed and there is no change in circumstances.",47,697,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00697

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),The amendments I have surfaced thus far aim to protect children from potential misuse of the MPA. Let me now turn to our efforts to enhance the MPA to protect neglected elderly parents.,51,701,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00701
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Under the Destitute Persons Act, destitute persons can be admitted into welfare homes if they are unable to support themselves and lack family support. Before admission, family members are engaged and they are encouraged to care for the destitute person. However, representatives of welfare homes who attended our focus group discussions observed that there are destitute parents, albeit a small number, who have children with the means to maintain them but do not do so. Some even refused contact with them.",52,702,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00702
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Although the MPA empowers such needy parents to claim maintenance from their children, they often choose not to, due to fears of further straining the relationship. In some cases, the parents have lost contact with their children and the welfare homes are unable to locate or contact the children.",53,703,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00703
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Despite repeated attempts at persuasion, the welfare homes are often unable to get the children to give maintenance or persuade the parent to apply for maintenance under the MPA. In such cases, there is nothing the welfare homes nor the authorities can do to get the children to fulfil their obligations to the parent who had raised and cared for them. As a result, such children effectively leave their parents to the care of the state when they can well afford to maintain them. This, in our opinion, is an unfair use of public funds.",54,704,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00704
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Our initial proposal was to empower the Commissioner to apply for maintenance on behalf of such destitute parents, even without their consent. However, we received mixed reactions. One-third of survey respondents were of the view that the parent's wishes should be respected. Some focus group participants also raised concern over the emotional distress that the Commissioner's application might cause to the parent, since it would be going against his wish.",55,705,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00705
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"We have accordingly moderated the proposal, to only empower Commissioner on his own motion, that is, not at the parent's behest, to have their children attend conciliation at the Commissioner's Office so that care arrangements for the parent can be discussed and the children can be reminded that they have the legal obligation to support their elderly parents. The proposed section 12B empowers the Commissioner to do this.",56,706,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00706
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"This softer approach will still uphold the principle that children have the obligation to maintain their parents and allow the Commissioner to hear the children's side of the story and encourage the child to support the parent, where appropriate.",57,707,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00707

The Commissioner will only initiate conciliation proceedings if, from the information obtained, he reasonably believes that the child is able to provide maintenance for the destitute parent.",59,709,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00709
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I would like to highlight that in order for the Commissioner's powers of mandatory conciliation to be used, the parent must either be already residing in a welfare home or be under investigation for admission so that he is there on a temporary basis. It is in this sense limited to cases where the abandonment of the parent is especially egregious.",60,710,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00710
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),Our fourth and final key amendment is to empower the Tribunal to make non-monetary directions.,61,711,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00711
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Maintenance cases before the Tribunal are often acrimonious and involve deep underlying issues that are not solved by only a monetary order. Indeed, the Tribunal has observed cases where non-monetary directions could help to address fundamental issues in the family. Addressing these issues will also go towards promoting the durability and sustainability of the maintenance order.",62,712,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00712
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),One clear example is when the parent has issues with problem gambling. There have been multiple cases where the children were unwilling to pay maintenance simply because they were aware of the problem gambling-related issues in the parent and are worried that the parent would gamble away the maintenance they received.,63,713,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00713
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"We thus propose to allow the Tribunal to make any non-monetary direction that it deems fit, if the direction is one that furthers one of the purposes under the new section 6(6), which include the exercise of financial responsibility by the parent or child and the management or resolution of conflicts between the parties.",64,714,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00714
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In cases where the Tribunal finds that the parent has issues related to problem-gambling, it can require the parent to attend gambling counselling. Similarly, if the Tribunal finds that the children's complaints against the parent's behaviour is valid, it can require the parent to cease performing that act which causes harm or suffering to the children. And for highly acrimonious cases with underlying relational issues, family counselling is a potential order that can be made as well.",65,715,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00715

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I am aware that this is a paradox – mending family ties requires us to go beyond money, but going beyond the ordering of maintenance leads down, some would say further down, the road to paternalism. It is indeed a road which I am reluctant to tread on, so I would like to say that this amendment is probably the furthest I would go in this direction and I would leave personal relationships to the personal realm.",67,717,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00717
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),One individual wrote a Forum letter that counselling is not always enough to ensure a real change in the behaviour of a problem gambler. We also had feedback from our public consultations that the child should not have to pay if the parent fulfils the counselling order but returns to gambling later on.,68,718,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00718
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"We agree with these views. If the parent returns to the same behaviour later on, the child can apply to the Tribunal for a variation of the maintenance order and the Tribunal can consider whether that is fair depending on the facts of the case.",69,719,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00719
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Some options the Tribunal could take up would be to change the mode of payment, so that the child pays the maintenance not in cash but through direct payment in areas such as utilities, medical care or groceries.",70,720,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00720
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),There is certainly no one-size-fits-all approach. There may be cases where the Tribunal could make other directions such as stopping harassment or giving a child access to visit his parent. The amendment will give the Tribunal more options to help and address the specific issues of the families involved in the claim.,71,721,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00721

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In closing, I wish to reiterate that the MPA is not about legislating filial piety. The law is not the appropriate vehicle for inculcating family values. The effort in promoting family values starts from families themselves, and flows out to schools, and the community and ethnic groups and voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs). I hope that as a society, we can continue to uphold family values of mutual support for each other. After all, the family is the basic building block of society.",76,726,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00726

This Bill is a testimony of the inputs and deliberations that the workgroup received in its distilled form. It derives its strength from our collective ideas and our pursuit of common values, and the sense of justice for all parties. As can be seen in the rest of my speech, these are not easy issues – to what extent is a person entitled to rely on his children for support, to what extent a person's freedom to use his own money as he sees fit, is constrained by his duty to his parent, and finally, to what extent is the state responsible for a man when even the most intimate ties of family fail?",6,736,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00736

I think it is also appropriate to pay tribute to the then hon Nominated Member of Parliament, Prof Walter Woon, who, almost three decades ago, in 1994, mooted the need for this House to legislate maintenance of parents by their children as a last resort in certain circumstances. When he tabled the Maintenance of Parents Bill, it generated some level of controversy in and outside the House.",7,737,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00737

Here, we are dealing with a scenario where the parent did not raise any record of ANA in his declaration and the Commissioner did not detect any record through his screening. As a result, the matter would have headed to conciliation as per the current process. It is contemplated that the child may raise facts suggesting that the parent has a record of ANA. Hence, we provided that the conciliation should stop in such circumstances and the parent should get permission from the Tribunal before it may resume.",13,743,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00743

2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"However, for cases where it is contemplated that permission will be refused, then a three-member Tribunal must be convened to make such a determination. This measure will safeguard the parent's interest in ensuring that his case is adequately deliberated before a decision is made against him.",17,747,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00747
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I now come to the important issue of threshold upon which the President, Deputy President or Tribunal will have to decide whether permission should be given. This is provided for in the proposed section 3B(7) in the Bill. In essence, it is provided that permission may be granted if there is a good arguable case at two levels  first, that the parent did not commit ANA; or second, the child should still maintain the parent on just and equitable grounds.",18,748,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00748
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Why provide the second level? This is because a record of ANA involves not just a matter of fact, which is dealt with at the first level, but a matter of degree, in respect of which the second level is meant to address.",19,749,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00749
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"What is meant by a ""good arguable case""? Here, we adopted the reasoning in a 2018 Court of Appeal decision and intend that it means that the applicant should have the better of the argument. This threshold is more than a ""prima facie"" case, but lower than that of a balance of probabilities.",20,750,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00750
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"What this also means is that the decision of the Tribunal at this stage is not dispositive of the ultimate issue at the hearing, which is whether, under section 5 of the Act, it should make a maintenance order against child if it considers it just and equitable that the child should maintain the parent.",21,751,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00751
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The Tribunal's grant of permission under section 3B in the Bill is not intended to tie its hands in relation to its deliberation and decision on the ultimate issue. Whether or not, as a matter of fact, the parent has abandoned, neglected or abused the child will continue to remain relevant at the hearing – relevant but not determinative. This is specifically provided for in the current section 5(4) of the Act.",22,752,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00752
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I now move to the circumstances in which the child may be allowed to participate in proceedings on the application for permission.,23,753,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00753
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As can be seen from the proposed section 3B(2) in the Bill, there is only a narrow exception to the rule that the child is not to be informed nor involved in the proceedings. This is because the policy objective is to prevent the child against whom the parent had a record of ANA from being subject to distress.",24,754,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00754
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Where, however, in a situation where the application for permission is filed arising from the discontinuation of conciliation, where information of the parent's record of ANA surfaced, the child would already be informed of the parent's claim. As I mentioned earlier, it is probable that the child would be the one who surfaces information pertaining to the parent's record of ANA.",25,755,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00755
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Here, in these specific circumstances, it is provided that if the child so wishes, he will be informed and he may be involved in the proceedings. This will enable him to lead evidence on matters pertaining to the parent's record of ANA that he surfaced at the conciliation. This must be so as a matter of fairness.",26,756,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00756
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In the event the Tribunal gives permission to allow the parent to claim maintenance from the child, then under the proposed section 12A(4) in the Bill, the matter should be referred for conciliation as per the current process. The current amendments are not meant to detract from the ""conciliation-first approach"" adopted by way of amendments to the Act in 2010.",27,757,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00757
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Since 2010, conciliation has been proven to be more successful in addressing and resolving the core issues between the parties and also has resulted in the savings of significant time and resources.",28,758,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00758
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I now deal with appeals against the decision of the Tribunal to the General Division of the High Court.,29,759,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00759
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Under the proposed section 18(3A) in the Bill, it is provided that an appeal may be brought against the Tribunal's decision not to grant permission to the General Division of the High Court.",30,760,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00760
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Whilst not expressly stated, this also means is that, subject to the High Court's powers under written law, including sections 16 and 17 of the Act, there is no appeal contemplated against the decision of the Tribunal where permission is granted for a parent to apply for maintenance. In addition, any appeal under the proposed section 18(3A) must satisfy the conditions in the current 18(2) of the Act, in that the appeal must involve a question of law or of mixed law and fact. Otherwise, the decision of the Tribunal is final, as is the case now.",31,761,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00761
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Also, unless the High Court directs otherwise, the appeal documents should not be served on the child. The appeal is also to be heard and determined without informing or involving the child. This is again consonant with the aim of the Bill, which is to spare the child who has been subject of ANA by his parent the distress of being informed and involved in the appeal proceedings. This position also applies in the situation where the child was originally informed and involved in the application for permission before the Tribunal.",32,762,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00762
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The appellant's interest is nonetheless safeguarded since the High Court has powers to issue directions requiring the child to attend the hearing of the appeal in appropriate circumstances as it sees fit.,33,763,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00763
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),How about cases where there are existing orders made in favour of parents even though they have records of ANA against their children?,34,764,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00764
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As was mentioned by the hon Member Mr Seah in his speech, the sense is that in the past, there may have been cases where the children may have decided to just give in to their parents' demands for maintenance so as to avoid traumatisation and distress. This Bill offers stronger protection against this.",35,765,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00765
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"So, what is the recourse for such children?",36,766,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00766
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The Bill provides a procedure for them under the proposed section 8 in the Bill. They may make an application to rescind or vary the maintenance order on the basis that their parents have records of ANA.,37,767,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00767
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"When such applications are made, the Tribunal, under the proposed section 14A in the Bill, will have powers to conduct screening against the parents and obtain the necessary information on the parents' records of ANA too. The Tribunal, should it be satisfied that the parent has a record of ANA that was not previously considered at the time when the maintenance order was made, will have the power to vary or rescind the maintenance order.",38,768,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00768
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, Madam, I would like to elaborate on the reasons why bespoke provisions dealing with the disclosure of information that was originally subject to gag orders by the Court are necessary for the purpose of establishing whether the parent has a record of ANA. This is provided for under the proposed section 14A in the Bill.",39,769,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00769
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Typically, the Court imposes gag orders in circumstances where it is necessary to protect identities of minors or victims of criminal offences, especially victims of sexual crimes. There could be situations where gag orders are imposed, preventing the disclosure of information on the identity of accused persons because their identities can lead to the establishment of the identities of the victims. This is particularly so where the accused persons could be the victims' parents.",40,770,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00770
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In a situation where the parent whose identity is protected by a gag order, subsequently applies for maintenance from a child, it is necessary to provide the Commissioner and the Tribunal, which are quasi-judicial bodies, access to information that may be relevant to establishing if the parents have records of ANA.",41,771,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00771
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the other hand, there is a need for safeguards to be in place so that the rationale behind the imposition of the gag order is not thwarted.",42,772,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00772
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"For these reasons, safeguards have been provided to limit the purpose of access to information protected by the gag order to only for the purposes of ascertaining if the parent has a record of ANA. In addition, there is a strict prohibition against disclosure to any other person save for the Commissioner, the Tribunal, the parent and the applicant for permission.",43,773,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00773
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have said that this law deals with difficult questions. However, these amendments provide us with not easy, but practical answers. They are a response to these questions which rests on our collective values. I think it is worth spelling these out so that the policy intent is clear.",44,774,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00774
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, that there remains a tie between a child and his parent, one which is born of the bare fact of the relationship rather than the quality of such relationships. That alone allows us a basis to consider cases as falling under this law. This underlines the importance of the family in the Singapore context.",45,775,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00775
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, such a tie, however, may or may not entail specific duties. Here, the law is quite clear that the moral basis for the existence of such duties rests on whether the parent has fulfilled a minimum level of care. Here, the test is a purely negative one. As long as the parent has not abused the child or treated him poorly, a duty is born.",46,776,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00776
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Again, this makes no pretence about the quality of parenting as a requirement, merely the minimum providence of some basic needs for a child. In short, one does not have to be a good parent, merely not a very bad one, to be able to make claims on a child.",47,777,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00777
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Third, and perhaps most importantly, this law does not circumscribe the Government's commitment to a citizen, which has a fairly neutral lens in relation to his parenting profile. That is to say, a man may be a terrible father but he is still a citizen and one does not have to be a good citizen – however this is defined – to benefit from the state's provision of resources towards one's welfare, which includes housing, healthcare, food and a certain quality of life.",48,778,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00778
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, this law underwrites a fact of public life, one which obliges us to use our tax dollars to maintain a man who has abused his children and so, in this instance, it can be said our obligations to each other, at least in dollar terms, exceed that of even a child to his father. I see this as a strength – that this law both limits the obligations of a child towards his abusive parent and spells out our obligations to each other as fellow citizens.",49,779,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00779

After all, if someone is still nursing or hurting from the hurts and the wounds of childhood ill-treatment by their parents of neglect or abandonment, the last thing he or she needs is to go through any process that suggests that they are being unfilial.

I am assured myself, having witnessed and facilitated many on their healing journeys, to give the public the same assurance, that not all ""reminders of past bad experiences"" are harmful. In fact, for true healing to take place, one often needs to confront the negative experiences of the past in order to see it through a new and empowered set of lens for our hearts to heal.

2023-07-04-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),The original proposal for amendment three allows for the Commissioner to claim maintenance from financially able children on behalf of the neglected and destitute parents and it presents exactly this dilemma.,32,877,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00877
2023-07-04-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"It is fortunate that the workgroup, upon discussion with the members of the public, were able to come up with a ""win-win"" solution that I felt comfortable and satisfied with.",33,878,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00878
2023-07-04-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"I am also thankful for Chairman Mr Seah Kian Peng's empathy and openness even as he passionately leads the charge on this Bill, to allow for alternative approaches to the original proposal, so that we get to balance. The outcome and revised proposal – to empower the Commissioner on his own motion and not at the parent's behest to have the children attend conciliation at the Commissioner's Office so that care arrangements can be discussed and their children can be reminded of their legal obligations – is a great balanced approach.",34,879,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00879
2023-07-04-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"In considering that preserving a good relationship between parent and child is the utmost priority in the elderly parents' minds, we have to ensure that we do no harm. Hence, what we really need to ensure is in the implementation, that the communication to children being asked to come forward for conciliation, knows that the request is being made by the Commissioner and not by the parents. This helps to achieve the balance needed, for fairness to fellow Singaporeans and also respects the relationship priority of the elderly parent.",35,880,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00880
2023-07-04-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"The other two amendments which allow for the Tribunal to give non-monetary directions for cases and for the Tribunal to dismiss frivolous and vexatious applications are relatively straightforward to me. They are enhancements to the Act made with 12 years of experience in consultation with the relevant agencies since it was last reviewed. So, I am satisfied that they are appropriate enhancements made in the spirit of fairness to both parent and children as well as to ensure that public resources are not frivolously frittered away.",36,881,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00881

2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"First, the history of the Maintenance of Parents Act, or MPA. The MPA, which was passed in 1995, was the brainchild of ex-Nominated Member of Parliament, Prof Walter Woon. It was a significant step forward in recognising the social responsibility of adult children to care for and support their parents who are financially dependent or vulnerable.",2,885,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00885
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The MPA was last amended in 2010 to enhance its effectiveness. One of the pivotal provisions which was introduced then was that of conciliation before parents could file for maintenance orders. This ensured that seniors and their children attempted to kind of resolve their differences amicably before resorting to legal measures. And consequently, the number of applications at the Tribunal significantly reduced to about 30 per year, signalling the success of this approach.",3,886,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00886
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"However, there is still room for improvement.",4,887,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00887

2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"First, it has been reported that one in three cases seen at the Tribunal involve allegations that the parents had previously abused, abandoned or neglected their children. This situation not only causes trauma to the adult children but also raises the question on whether it is fair to obligate them to provide maintenance to parents who have mistreated them.",6,889,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00889
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second development was that there have been cases of errant children who leave their elderly parents in care facilities, expecting the facility management to care for, to raise funds and to bear the financial burden of their parents' maintenance. We feel that such behaviour is unacceptable and calls for correction.",7,890,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00890
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"So, the latest round of proposed amendments aims to address these key issues and also introduce ways to improve effectiveness of the MPA. They include provisions that require records of abuse, abandonment or neglect to be considered before parents can seek maintenance orders, it also involves dismissal of frivolous and vexatious applications; and directions of financial and/or non-monetary measures; amongst others.",8,891,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00891
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I would like to raise three commonly posed questions that often linger on the minds of Singaporeans whenever the issue of maintenance of parents is broached; and then to share my own reflections. One, is the MPA still relevant in Singapore society today? Two, can matters of familial relations be addressed through legal provisions? And three, can the MPA address the issue of retirement inadequacy for elderly parents in need?",9,892,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00892
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Question one - is the MPA still relevant in Singapore society today? Supporters of the Act argue that it reflects the enduring value of filial piety deeply rooted in our Singaporean culture. They believe that adult children have a social responsibility to care for and to support their parents, especially when parents are financially dependent or vulnerable or needy. These proponents contend that placing this responsibility on children prevents burdening the public welfare system, which is funded by other taxpayers. So that is for the supporters.",10,893,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00893
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"On the other hand, opponents of the Act emphasise the importance of individual choice and agency. They argue that adult children should have the freedom to decide whether or not they want to provide financial support to their needy parents. Some even highlight that while parents choose to give birth to their children, the children themselves did not ask to be born. Others then contend that they are already financially supporting their own families and have their own expenditures to cover, and should not be legally obligated to support their parents.",11,894,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00894
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"But what does the current landscape inform us? An MSF report published in 2022 is called ""Ageing Families in Singapore, 2010-2020"". This report highlights that families remain a key source of physical, emotional and financial support for the elderly. A majority of elderly individuals aged 65 years and above cited that they could rely on their married children, 90%, and unmarried children, 83% of them, for financial support in times of need.",12,895,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00895
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Additionally, the 2018 the Housing and Development Board (HDB) Sample Household Survey reveals that 74% of HDB residents aged 55 and above received regular financial support from their children in 2018, a five-percentage point drop from 79% 10 years ago in 2008. So, still quite a substantive number.",13,896,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00896
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Nevertheless, expectations of filial piety – as very articulately explained or described by Ms Carrie Tan, my hon Member friend – expectations of filial piety norms are shifting across generations. My young adult friends remind me that there are alternative ways to express filial piety beyond solely financial support, such as paying for dinner outings, birthday gifts or spending family time together. This evolving trend suggests the need for each generation to plan for their own well-being to avoid over-reliance on their children.",14,897,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00897
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"However, changes in society norms take time to fully materialise. While the landscape continues to shift, the MPA which obliges children to provide basic support to their parents in need, remains, in my mind, still relevant. It acknowledges the possibility that without legal intervention, some elderly parents may face challenges in receiving the necessary care and support from their adult children. It, therefore, serves as a safety net to ensure the well-being of these elderly parents.",15,898,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00898
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),Question two – can matters in familial relations be addressed through legal provisions? Family dynamics and circumstances vary greatly from one family to another; and so it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the legal system in resolving familial conflicts and dynamics.,16,899,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00899
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Let me share a few cases to illustrate this point. In one case, a woman – she is a professional executive – had a physically and verbally abusive father who had caused her immense trauma since young. This woman, who wrote in to me and Member Seah Kian Peng, spent many years of her life, 40 years, running away from the father, even to the extent of changing her legal name and at one time, living overseas to escape his threats. The father stalked her and even resorted to social media to threaten her. To this day, this woman is still receiving medical treatment. When he filed a claim for maintenance from her, she pleaded to the Ministry to protect her identity and whereabouts.",17,900,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00900
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),This case highlights the challenges of enforcing legal provisions when issues of abuse and safety are concerned.,18,901,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00901
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Furthermore, in other cases, even when faced with similar circumstances, family members also can respond differently. At a Tribunal session I sat in to observe as a workgroup member, a pair of adult siblings responded quite differently to their mother whom they claim had abused them when young. The brother chose to forgive the mother, while acknowledging her shortcomings. The sister was re-traumatised, being even in the same room as the mother and shared that she is now seeing a counsellor again.",19,902,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00902
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"And then, in other families, there are parents who refuse to file claims against their errant, able children for financial support, even when they are abandoned or neglected in eldercare facilities.",20,903,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00903
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"These variations in responses in families just show the complexity of family relationships and the need for individualised approach; not cookie-cutter solutions. The work of the Commissioner and Tribunal in conciliation and in issuing directives, is complex and challenging. The provisions in this Bill that grant more flexibility and space for them to consider and conclude are, therefore, very essential.",21,904,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00904
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Hence, I fully support any provisions in the Bill to grant more flexibility and space for the Commissioner and the Tribunal to consider and conclude.",22,905,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00905
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Finally, moving on to the third and final question frequently raised about this Act – can the MPA in Singapore address the issue of retirement inadequacy for elderly parents in need?",23,906,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00906
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Most of us know that by 2030, approximately 22%, or at least one in five of the resident population will be 65 years and above, with nearly one in three elderly persons in Singapore forecasted to require eldercare services. We found out that many who regularly provide for their elderly parents can only afford a monthly allowance of $500 or less, this quantum is also reflected similarly in maintenance orders. From 2016 to 2020, 82% of awards that are granted by the Tribunal had a monthly quantum of less than $500.",24,907,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00907
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"It is, therefore, unlikely that family allowances alone will be the main source of elderly support, whether or not they are covered by the MPA. Hence, the Act will not totally address the issue of retirement inadequacy for elderly parents in need. A slew of Government and societal provisions has been introduced to meet these needs, and work is still in progress. These include  raising of Retirement Age so that those who wish to continue to work can choose to do so; CPF Life Annuity Scheme; Silver Support Scheme; CareShield; HDB's Rental Scheme, Housing Leaseback Scheme and Assisted Community Care Apartments and Public Assistance Scheme for seniors who qualify for long-term financial assistance from MSF.",25,908,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00908
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Unfortunately, though, many Singaporeans are still unprepared for retirement. To address this, more proactive education should be in place so that every Singaporean has a clearer idea of their own Individual Retirement Adequacy Plan, and to also have their own Retirement Adequacy Plan. The MPA then, is just one of the tools available for a small target group of seniors within the broader framework of retirement adequacy planning measures for Singapore's elderly.",26,909,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00909
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In conclusion, Madam, the MPA is not a silver bullet and there are potential problems that may continue to arise. For instance, what if documented records of abuse or neglect are not available? How do we handle cases of children based overseas who refuse to comply? And what if non-monetary measures directed by the Tribunal, such as family counseling, do not yield positive results? These are questions we will continue to have to ponder over.",27,910,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00910
2023-07-04-T-017,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Nevertheless, the principles of family being one's first stop for support, reciprocity and filial piety that is enshrined in the MPA are still worth retaining. It is crucial for us legislators to stay vigilant about ageing trends, evolving expectations of parents and children, and to also draw lessons from other legislations. This will ensure the relevancy of the MPA and protect the well-being of our elderly through a balance of legal obligations and evolving cultural norms. With these considerations in mind, Madam, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.",28,911,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00911

2023-07-04-T-017,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"As for the amendment to prevent parents who have abused, abandoned or neglected their children in the past from misusing the Maintenance of Parents Act, I have a question. What happens if a parent had supported the child for a number of years before moving out of the child's life? In some relationships, the interactions might be a combination of both care provision and abuse, or partial care and financial support in some years followed by abandonment or neglect in other years for a variety of reasons, such as conflict with the other parent, family problems, health or mental illnesses, and so on and so forth. Would the Ministry accord the parent some partial support from his children?",13,925,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00925
2023-07-04-T-017,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Another question I have is regarding the child from whom the parent seeks support. What if the parent has a few children but only seeks support from a particular one? For example, the parent may choose to ask only – may only ask help from a child who happens to be unmarried with no children of his own. With or without children, everyone has an equal responsibility to support his or her parents. Will the Ministry help to mediate for fairness?",14,926,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00926
2023-07-04-T-017,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"In conclusion, the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill provides us with an opportunity to address the changing social dynamics in Singapore. I believe in taking a proactive approach by working with MOE to integrate teachings on filial piety and family values into our educational system. By nurturing a sense of responsibility and care for our elders, we can shape a society where the financial responsibility towards parents is shared, while upholding our cultural values. Let us engage in meaningful discussions, seeking input from all segments of society, to craft a legislation that respects our traditions, recognises the evolving nature of our families, and ensures a fair distribution of financial responsibilities.",15,927,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00927

Especially as my constituency, Radin Mas, has many seniors and I interact with many of them on an almost daily basis. Occasionally, my grassroots leaders and I would come across cases where a senior would seek financial assistance and other means of assistance, as they were not adequately taken care of by their family members. In such cases, we rely on the MPA as an avenue of last resort to provide a legal recourse for neglected seniors to receive a basic maintenance, in terms of financial support, from their children.",5,973,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00973

The Government can support with broad-based financial and social support but the Government can only do so much.

The Bill now takes a more balanced approach, where the Commissioner is empowered to locate the children of destitute parents and require them to attend conciliation so as to hear the children's side of the story. I believe that this is a good balance as it enhances the chances of conciliation between parties. As the proportion of seniors in our society increases, we should do all we can to try to mend relationships, so that our elders can have the fullest support from their children as they age.",9,977,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00977

The Tribunal will be allowed to set conditions on the payment of maintenance and if the parent does not comply with the non-monetary order, then the children will not be obligated to pay maintenance. I fully support this, as it would help to address squarely some of the underlying reasons why certain parent-child relationships had deteriorated in some of these cases.",14,982,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00982

As Singapore ages rapidly, we are likely to see more of such cases with issues potentially becoming increasingly complicated. The proposed amendments in this Bill are timely and necessary but would certainly not be the last. We must continue to review the Act periodically to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

Could we also allow the conciliation platform to introduce such remedies, albeit conciliation not being a tribunal, being short of an order? In the spirit of reciprocity, the introduction of such remedies could also extend to children and whole family facing such issues.",11,995,2023-07-04-T-017-S-00995

2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Financial contribution is but one way to practise filial piety.

2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"In speaking with social workers on this issue, I understand from their experiences that the complexity of family relationships is very high. Many of the parents who are destitute or homeless, either on the streets or in shelters, have been living this way by choice and over a long period of time. The reason in almost all cases is that they are estranged from their spouse and the children and more often than not, they are the ones who walked out on the family and abandoned the children. Most of them do not wish to even start the process of conciliation as they do believe that they were the ones at fault and that there is no reason for their children to take them back.",14,1011,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01011

2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"How many cases have been handled since this Bill passed into law in 1995?

2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Finally, my last question of clarification. From the experiences of the social workers, the elderly who need help would probably approach the social service agencies first and the social workers will always propose conciliatory engagement with the family even as they help the elderly with ComCare or Silver Support where appropriate.",20,1017,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01017

2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),I echo Member Carrie Tan's caution to be sensitive in the communications' approach and the language used with the children to ensure that we do not do more harm to already estranged relationships.,22,1019,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01019

2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Firstly, we will do well to remember that each of us is a son or daughter to parents. We did not give ourselves lives but we have received our first great gift of life from our parents. As a Catholic, I have been taught from young, ""Children, obey your parents for that is what is expected of you. Honour your father and your mother and it may go well with you and that you may have a long life on the earth.""",24,1021,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01021
2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"I am sure that my friends of other faiths have similar teachings. All the major religions and philosophies of life teach more or less the same thing in this regard. Children are to honour their parents, which includes actions of care, assistance and support, especially when parents become elderly and/or are not financially independent.",25,1022,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01022
2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Likewise, parents must fulfil their responsibilities for having brought their children into this world. Abuse and abandonment are not acceptable acts. It is sad when such cases occur and are symptoms of deeper issues in society that need to be resolved.",26,1023,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01023
2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"One's family is the gift we have been given. We did not choose them. For those who may have been gifted, unfortunately, with a family that has been a ""living hell"" for them, I can only pray and hope that they may find closure and conciliation. It was quite heartening to hear one of the hon Members share a story whereby one of the siblings forgave the parents who were asking for maintenance.",27,1024,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01024
2023-07-04-T-017,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Finally, as a community, ""we must reawaken the collective sense of gratitude, of appreciation, of hospitality, which makes the elderly feel like a living part of the community."" This, I quote from Pope Francis' teaching in his book, The Joy of Love. Notwithstanding my clarifications, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",28,1025,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01025

2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the importance of filial piety is deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness. Throughout the ages, captivating tales of filial devotion have been woven into the tapestry of our cultural heritage. They serve as powerful reminders of the importance of honouring and caring for our parents.",1,1027,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01027
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"One of the most famous stories about filial piety comes from the classic teachings of Confucianism, known as the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars.",2,1028,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01028
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"One of the teachings involved a man named Jiang Ge, who lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty. As a young boy, he lost his father. He was brought up by his mother, whom he became extremely devoted to. During a period of war and chaos, Jiang Ge fled his hometown, carrying his elderly mother on his back all the way. They encountered bandits several times. These thieves intended to kill them. But upon witnessing Jiang Ge's filial piety, the bandits could not bear to harm the mother and son, and even pointed out a safe route to him.",3,1029,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01029
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),Jiang Ge and his mother eventually found safe refuge and he worked hard and lived simply. This was to ensure that his mother had everything she needed until the end of her days.,4,1030,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01030
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Jiang Ge's story is a powerful example of filial piety, where a son's unwavering commitment to his mother's wellbeing in the face of adversity is recognised and honoured, even by crooks. It also epitomises the very essence of filial piety – the importance of caring for and respecting our parents, regardless of the challenges we may encounter.",5,1031,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01031
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It mirrors the sacrifices that parents make to raise their children. It illustrates the reciprocity inherent in the bond between parents and offspring. This captivating story, much like others within the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, vividly illustrates the ideal relationship between parents and children.",6,1032,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01032
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"This Bill that we are discussing today ultimately revolves around this concept of filial piety. However, life is often not so simple. Families face a myriad of unique issues, ranging from instances of parental abuse and neglect to cases where the children themselves endure these hardships inflicted on them by their own parents.",7,1033,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01033
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),It is precisely because of these complexities and the need to address such diverse situations that we find ourselves gathered here today.,8,1034,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01034
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),I would like to seek some clarifications on the Bill.,9,1035,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01035
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my first clarification is regarding clause 4 of the Bill. It is important to consider that many of these cases date back to a time when the adult children were themselves young and vulnerable. It was uncommon for children of that age to speak out or report their parents' actions.",10,1036,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01036
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In the past, conflicts within families were typically treated as private affairs. These were often resolved or not talked about beyond the household without formal reports.",11,1037,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01037
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As a result, access to family counselling was limited. The idea of foster care or shelters then was also felt to be primarily catered to children who had lost their parents. It is only in recent years where there are more government initiatives to raise awareness that domestic abuse has begun to be taken more seriously.",12,1038,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01038
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Considering these circumstances, it raises the question of what additional services or processes are available to assist these individuals in providing evidence of such neglect or abuse. Without a Police or social welfare report, how else can they substantiate claims of ill treatment?",13,1039,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01039
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Furthermore, it is critical that we clarify what constitutes sufficiently serious abuse to exempt an individual from the responsibilities outlined in this Bill. For instance, let us consider a situation where a child's basic needs were met but he endured frequent verbal abuse or witnessed his mother being subjected to abuse due to their father's infidelity, gambling addiction or alcoholism. These circumstances had a profound impact on his upbringing and mental well-being. In response to this toxic environment, the child made the difficult decision to estrange himself from his family as soon as he was financially capable. Should this child be expected to resume his responsibility to financially support his parents?",14,1040,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01040
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, clause 4 raises important questions regarding the circumstances that led to the parents' destitution. What if the parents' financial hardship is a result of their own financial mismanagement or previous instances of family abuse? Additionally, how many of these destitute parents have willingly chosen this path despite having the means to provide a roof over their own heads?",15,1041,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01041
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Also, in doing so, are we inadvertently perpetuating the notion of children being seen as a retirement plan, a concept that is progressively being questioned by youths today? Should individuals who have suffered severe abuse at the hands of their parents, to the point where attending mandatory conciliatory sessions would trigger them and reopen old wounds, be forced to participate in these sessions?",16,1042,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01042
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Third, we must consider how the Tribunal will determine a reasonable amount to support these parents, particularly to prevent any potentially excessive claims. This becomes even more significant when considering the sandwich class, who may already face challenges in raising their own children. It is important to strike a balance that ensures adequate support for the parents while avoiding any abuse of the system.",17,1043,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01043
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Finally, will statistics be shared to shed light on the number of instances in which the law has been unfairly used against children? Sharing such data can help identify any patterns or discrepancies, enabling us to make informed decisions and address any issues that may arise.",18,1044,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01044
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the story of Jiāng Gé that I shared earlier is not unique. The virtue of honouring parents stands as a golden rule that has been ingrained in various religions and cultures throughout history. It is a universal teaching.",19,1045,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01045
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Nevertheless, we have to recognise that complex dynamics interplay within families. The reality is that no two families are the same and perfection is often elusive. Each family faces its own unique set of challenges and problems.",20,1046,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01046
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"During my interactions with residents at my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) in Yio Chu Kang, I have witnessed numerous cases typifying these complex dynamics. Sibling rivalries and disparities in wealth between the children's families often place a significant strain on the division of caregiving responsibilities for their parents. It is not uncommon for unmarried children to shoulder the primary burden of caregiving for aged parents, leading to feelings of resentment and imbalance. Furthermore, the introduction of spouses into the equation further complicates matters. Hence, the notion of ""perfect families"" where the responsibility of supporting aged parents is equitably distributed is a rarity.",21,1047,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01047
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"This legislation may be perceived as an unfortunate necessity, acknowledging the sad reality that extreme cases of elder neglect or abuse do exist in Singapore. In such distressing cases, the state needs to provide avenues for justice for parents who have selflessly devoted themselves to raising their children. Similarly, the state also has the responsibility to provide justice for the individuals who have suffered at the hands of their parents, which some of the amendments in this Bill addressed. However, it is important to recognise that this Bill does not address the underlying issue at its core, the weakening family ties and the diminished perception amongst children regarding the importance of reciprocating their parents' love and care.",22,1048,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01048
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),How then do we tackle this issue?,23,1049,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01049
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"One key focus area must be the reinforcement of education from an early age to honour parents and for parents to understand that love and respect are bi-directional. Responsible parenting plays a significant role in shaping children into model citizens. Parents should actively engage with their children, spend quality time with them and provide emotional support. They should be good role models by treating their own parents and their children's grandparents with love and respect. By strengthening the bonds between parents and children, we can build a foundation of trust and love within families. In doing so, we reduce the likelihood of strained relationships that necessitate legal intervention in the likes of the Maintenance of Parents Act.",24,1050,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01050
2023-07-04-T-017,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"When love becomes the driving force within families, familial duty comes naturally. This is an intrinsic expression of affection and care, rather than being perceived as a burden or legal obligation. This is how we support families in Singapore, by building a resilient society that values family well-being and supports caregiving. I support the Bill.",25,1051,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01051

2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the MPA is a significant legislative framework that addresses the financial support and maintenance of elderly parents in Singapore. Under the MPA, children who are capable of providing support but neglect their duty to do so can be legally obligated to provide financial maintenance to their parents.",3,1055,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01055
2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"In 2022, a total of 110 cases were submitted to the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents (CMP). This figure has dropped from 303 cases in 2012, the highest level over the past decade. Our elderly also receives more support from the Government through schemes, such as the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation packages, which, among other things, offer additional subsidies for healthcare.",4,1056,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01056
2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"The MPA recognises the importance of upholding the values of filial piety and social responsibility, which are deeply rooted in the fabric of our society. It serves as a means to safeguard the well-being and dignity of elderly parents who may be financially dependent or vulnerable. By providing a legal mechanism, the MPA aims to ensure that elderly parents receive the necessary support from their children to meet their basic needs and maintain a reasonable standard of living.",5,1057,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01057
2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"In a nutshell, the MPA stands as a legislative pillar, reflecting the core values of our society. It serves as a poignant reminder of our responsibility that adult children bear towards their ageing parents. It encapsulates the cherished belief that filial sons and daughters should provide unwavering care and support during their parents' golden years.",6,1058,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01058
2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Amidst the ever-evolving nature of our society, we must not allow ourselves to lose sight of the intrinsic values of respect, love and care that permeate our cultural fabric. It is incumbent upon us to foster an environment that encourages the nurturing of these values within our communities. By doing so, we empower Singaporeans, particularly the Malay/Muslim community, to preserve the sacred tenets of filial piety while adapting to the demands of contemporary life.",7,1059,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01059
2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Education and awareness programmes must take centrestage, enlightening individuals about the fundamental significance of fulfilling their duties towards their parents. These initiatives should delve beyond mere financial obligations and focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of caregiving. By fostering understanding and empathy within families, we can facilitate meaningful conversations that bridge generational gaps and strengthen familial bonds. Furthermore, we can harness the power of community resources, such as counselling services and support networks, to assist individuals facing financial constraints while ensuring their parents' well-being.

Nonetheless, as we navigate the complexities of caregiving and familial responsibilities, we must acknowledge that exceptional circumstances may arise, leaving families in dire straits.

2023-07-04-T-017,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Moreover, as we explore this ""last resort"" option, we must also emphasise the importance of preventative measures. By investing in early intervention programs, financial literacy initiatives and comprehensive social support networks, we can empower families to overcome potential challenges before they reach a critical point. These proactive measures can help alleviate the risk of destitution and ensure that families have the necessary resources and knowledge to fulfil their filial duties without resorting to extreme measures.",11,1063,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01063

2023-07-04-T-017,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"So, clearly, Singaporeans continue to hold the family as a fundamental bulwark of our society – family members caring for and supporting one another. This is the hallmark of Singapore society. It makes us different and it helps us think beyond ourselves. Around the world, there are other models. Some societies regard the individual as supreme and triumphs over the family. To be sure, this affirms the dignity of every person and allows individual potential and special talents to flourish. But such an individual is likely to also attribute his achievements to his own capability and may not stop to look at his family, his community and society which provided the conditions for his success. As each generation feels it had made it solely on its own steam, mutual care and support across generations weaken. In Singapore's case, however, we believe that strong families empower its individual members to thrive and to flourish, which is why strong families make for a resilient Singapore society.",5,1074,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01074

The MPA is meant to be applied for a small minority of children who neglect their responsibility when their parents cannot support themselves adequately, and they have the means to help. In 2022, slightly over 100 elderly parents sought a maintenance order under the MPA. Most of them managed to resolve their maintenance disputes with their children at conciliation. Only a very small number proceeded to bring their dispute to the Tribunal. Yet, one is one too many, and there is room for improvement.",9,1078,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01078

For the elderly and families who do not have enough financial resources, the community and the state will step up to play a bigger role. We are invested in supporting and strengthening families and will continue to help lower-income elderly who do not have family support, or whose children lack the means to support them. This includes support schemes such as  (a)	the Pioneer Generation Package, which provides healthcare benefits for life for all Singapore Citizens born before 1950; (b) the Silver Support Scheme, which provides quarterly cash supplements to Singaporeans who had low incomes throughout life and who have little or no family support in old age; (c) ComCare, which supports lower-income households with their basic living needs; (d) the Community Network for Seniors, which involves Government agencies and community partners teaming up to reach out to seniors, especially those who are lower-income or living alone, to help them stay active, socially engaged and connected to support and health services; as well as (e) the Senior Mobility and Enabling Fund, which provides subsidies for assistive devices, transport and home healthcare items for seniors to age in place within the community.",10,1079,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01079

2023-07-04-T-017,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"First, on the power of the Commissioner concerning destitute parents. The MPA provides a last resort to compel maintenance from children who neglect their duty towards their elderly parents. But as the Workgroup rightly pointed out, it is of no use if the parent refuses to initiate the process. We know of a few destitute parents residing in state-funded welfare homes who had children they could have relied on in their old age. But the children exploited their parents' reluctance to file a claim and shunned their responsibility when they clearly have the means to maintain their parents. The many attempts to persuade the children were futile. Hands were tied and nothing else could be done to take them to task.",14,1083,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01083
2023-07-04-T-017,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"I agree that in such glaring cases, the Commissioner should be allowed to act without needing the parent to initiate the process.

2023-07-04-T-017,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"Mr Yip Hon Weng has asked how many destitute parents have willingly chosen this path despite having the means to provide a roof over their own heads. To clarify, people who have the means to provide a roof over their heads would not meet the criteria for being destitute under the Destitute Persons Act. Only those who are unable to support themselves and lack family support can be admitted into welfare homes.",16,1085,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01085
2023-07-04-T-017,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"Some may think this is an attempt to transfer the burden of caring for our needy elderly from the state onto the children. This is not the case. The Workgroup has emphasised that the amendment is intended for the Commissioner to intervene only as a last resort, after the welfare home has exhausted all other options and only if the Commissioner reasonably believes that the parent has no records of abandonment, abuse or neglect, and that the children can afford the maintenance.",17,1086,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01086

Let me cite a case that my Ministry handled, of a survivor in her 20s. This young woman experienced emotional and physical abuse by her mother and stepfather since she was very young. She was told that she was useless and had things – physical objects – thrown at her. When she was not even 10 years old, her stepfather started to sexually abuse her, and MSF was alerted of her case a few years later. After receiving therapy, I am glad to note that she was able to complete her Polytechnic education and find employment in life. However, the long-term effects of abuse are still manifest in her daily life, such as her fear of loud noises, low self-esteem and, occasionally, self-harm and suicidal tendencies.

The President and Deputy President of the Tribunal, who heads each Tribunal, have the qualifications of a District Judge. The Tribunal is well equipped to make evidential assessments and determine in each case whether the parent has discharged his burden.",14,1118,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01118
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"The hon Member may then ask why give the parent who has an official record of ANA the right to ask for permission to apply for maintenance from his child. The reason is really to ensure fairness and justice for the parent. He should, for example, be allowed to argue that the document providing details of his case does not objectively suggest that he has a record of ANA or that it does not present a full and accurate picture.",15,1119,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01119
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"The hon Member invited me to provide guides, some guidance to the Tribunal on how it should proceed with its duties in assessing whether or not to grant permission.",16,1120,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01120
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Respectfully, I would demur. I mentioned that the Tribunal consists of experienced people who are more than qualified to make determinations without such assistance. In fact, the policy objective is quite the opposite. To give the Tribunal wide latitude to determine what is just and equitable having regard to the circumstances of the case.",17,1121,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01121
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"As was mentioned during my speech earlier, there is one narrow exception to the rule of not involving the child – where the Commissioner learns about the parent having a record of ANA during conciliation proceedings with the child. Here the issue of wanting to prevent the child from re-traumatisation would be moot because he was already being put on notice. It is specifically provided in the Bill that the child in these circumstances would have an opportunity to participate in the proceedings to get permission —",18,1122,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01122

2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Yes. Where the Tribunal grants permission, or where there is no official record of parents' ANA, then the process that will follow is, in essence, equivalent of the current system.",1,1124,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01124
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"I would, therefore, not characterise the proposal in the Bill to provide for a sieving mechanism that I described as making it more traumatising for the child as suggested by the hon Member.",2,1125,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01125
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"It is noteworthy that, by this point, the parents with official records of ANA would have been excluded unless they obtain permission from the Tribunal. We would have succeeded in protecting the children of these parents from being re-traumatised.",3,1126,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01126
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"The hon Member asked if the child may challenge the Tribunal's decision to grant the parent permission to proceed with the application to apply for maintenance. The short answer is no. By the time the permission is granted to the parent to bring a maintenance application against his child, the sieving process would have ended. The child's rights as they exist under the Act today are preserved. As is provided for in the current system, he or she will be able to adduce evidence of the parents’ ANA of him or her in opposition to the parent's application for maintenance. The Tribunal's decision to grant the parent permission to apply for maintenance does not impact on the ability of the child to oppose the maintenance application.",4,1127,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01127
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Finally, the hon Member raised issues pertaining to a possible underreporting of abuse cases in around 2015. He asked what recourse does a child who is affected by this have.",5,1128,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01128
2023-07-04-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, the proposed amendments do not take away from the child the ability to lead evidence on the parents' ANA independent of any records of ANA that the parent may have. The Tribunal will be able to accord appropriate weight to such evidence and decide in accordance with what is just and equitable in the circumstances.",6,1129,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01129

All of them have played an important part in putting together this Bill. We did not initially agree on everything, and many of the issues discussed today had also been debated internally.",2,1133,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01133
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"I also want to thank all of them for speaking in this debate today to further explain the different perspectives, articulate their own views and how we eventually landed on these recommendations in this amendment Bill.",3,1134,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01134
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"There were also many others who journeyed with us over the last one-and-a-half years as we deliberated, as we listened in to the focus groups, as we analysed the surveys, as we talked to various stakeholders – and the list goes on. This piece of legislative work is very much a result of their efforts for which I am eternally grateful to all of them.",4,1135,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01135
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,I also wish to thank Mr Murali Pillai for helping me address some of the queries which Member Mr Louis Ng has raised but I do agree it was a bit long [Laughter.]. And to also Member Ms Tin Pei Ling for spearheading the workgroup's public outreach and feedback process.,5,1136,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01136
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"The policies behind the Bill have gone through rounds of revision, containing the collective wisdom of all Singaporeans and professionals who had given us their views. Indeed, those in Parliament who have spoken in this debate, they have all unanimously supported the amendment Bill. I want to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Eric Chua, for his support and for his endorsement of our proposals too.",6,1137,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01137
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"If the Bill is passed today, the baton will now be handed over to MSF to ensure that the amendments are implemented effectively.",7,1138,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01138
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,Let me quickly address some specific queries which Members have raised.,8,1139,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01139
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Don Wee asked what if the parent has a few children but only seeks support from particular ones. To be sure, any parent who makes a maintenance application can choose which child or children he wishes to file the application against. Yet, if I am one of the children at the receiving end of a maintenance claim, the MPA allows me to join my siblings to the application. After doing so, those siblings whom I have joined will be co-respondents, and the Tribunal may order any or all of them to contribute maintenance, depending on the facts of the case.",9,1140,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01140
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"This was built into the Bill right at the beginning of the history of the MPA by then Assoc Prof Walter Woon, who saw that it was not fair that only one child should bear the burden, to the exclusion of others.",10,1141,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01141
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Don Wee also asked what happens if the parent supported the child for some years but later moved out of the child's life. For such a case, if there are official records of abandonment, abuse or neglect, then the parent will have to first obtain the leave of the Tribunal if he wants to proceed with his claim. At the leave hearing, the Tribunal will consider the specific facts and the degree of the abandonment, abuse or neglect. If the parent is able to show a good reason why he is nevertheless still deserving of maintenance, the Tribunal may allow him to proceed if it is just and equitable. And if leave is granted and a maintenance order is eventually made, the quantum will be set at a just amount, taking into account the above factors.",11,1142,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01142
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Ms Janet Ang also asked whether other countries have similar legislation. Actually, maintenance of parents legislation is not unique to Singapore. Not many countries but some of the countries that have it include India, Israel and France.",12,1143,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01143
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,Let me move next to deal with the question on why it is timely for this review to be done and these amendments made.,13,1144,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01144
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"The issue of destitute parents with children who have means, needs addressing. We have heard the view that children do not owe anything to their parents since they did not ask to be born. We need to reiterate clearly what we as a society expect of children, regardless of whether the parents have the desire to claim against their children or not.",14,1145,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01145
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"We have specifically scoped this amendment to allow the Commissioner to initiate conciliation for the children whose parents are in welfare homes or are undergoing assessment for admission. These are the cases where the abandonment is the most egregious. These parents are left without a roof over their heads and without means of sustenance. And meanwhile, the children remain uncontactable.",15,1146,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01146
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,It is time for such children to be called upon to fulfil their obligations.,16,1147,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01147
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Yip Hon Weng was concerned about calling in the children for conciliation when the parents became destitute on account of their own financial mismanagement, or when they previously abused their children. Likewise, Ms Janet Ang observed that for many destitute parents, it is not the children who have abandoned their parent, but the parent who first walked out of the family.",17,1148,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01148
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"I would like to assure the Members that if the Commissioner has any reason – any reason – to believe that there was abandonment, abuse or neglect on the part of the parent, he will not conduct conciliation. This does indeed mean that for a good many destitute parents, this amendment will not apply to them. Like the MPA as a whole, it is only for those few cases where it is the children, holding on to the mindset that they owe nothing to those who have tirelessly brought them up and blatantly abandon their parent.",18,1149,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01149
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"But cases where the parent had cared for the child and later become destitute due to financial mismanagement, they are different. The parent may have made financial mistakes in the past, but if there was genuine care for the child, then my view is that the child should provide at least some support and there should not be total abandonment of his or her parent.",19,1150,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01150
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"This amendment will not compel the child to give any particular sum of money. It only allows the Commissioner to call the child in so that a discussion can take place. I think that is reasonable and appropriate. Through such discussion, it could even lead to an improvement in ties between child and parent – and that is something that I hope will, in some cases, happen.",20,1151,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01151
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,Ms Janet Ang also asked if cases can be initiated by social workers. The MPA does allow applications to be made on the parent's behalf by persons who have the parent's authorisation. This is for cases where the parent is unable to make his own application due to an infirmity.,21,1152,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01152
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Ms Ang also asked if we would consider conciliatory efforts by social service agencies, before the Commissioner reaches out to the children of destitute parents. This is indeed what our workgroup has recommended. The Commissioner will only act as a last resort, when the attempts of the welfare homes and social workers to reach out to children do not succeed, or when they cannot be located or contacted. It is in such cases that the Commissioner's powers of identifying and locating the children for the purposes of conciliation are helpful, and the Commissioner can then call them in to hear their side of the story. Indeed, if the concern is on conciliatory efforts, there is no better place for this than in the Commissioner's office, given its long history and good track record in terms of resolution rates.",22,1153,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01153
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,The amendments to prevent the misuse of the Act are certainly timely.,23,1154,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01154
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Many of those who responded to our public consultation paper felt that it was about time this issue was looked into, to help what one respondent described as the ""broken children trapped within an adult body"". Their only qualm was that it would not be enough, since only those with official records of abandonment, abuse or neglect will benefit from this amendment. This is echoed by Mr Louis Ng and Mr Yip Hon Weng in the House today.",24,1155,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01155
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"I want to assure Members that both the Commissioner and Tribunal are mindful of unreported cases and they will adopt a trauma-informed approach in sensitively supporting them through the whole process. Where appropriate and with consent, they are also assisted by referrals to help services and counselling so that they can find healing.",25,1156,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01156
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"From my own observation of Tribunal proceedings, the Tribunal will hear all parties and consider all circumstances of the case, including the form and extent of abuse or neglect, to determine whether it will be just and equitable for the child to maintain the parent.",26,1157,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01157
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Evidence that can be furnished to the Tribunal is not limited to official records. It can also consist of oral or written recollection of the abuse incidents from the viewpoint of the child. As I had mentioned before, one in three cases at the Tribunal involve such accounts of abandonment, abuse or neglect. The majority were dismissed.",27,1158,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01158
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"But the fact remains that where there are no official records, the abuse would be unknown to the Tribunal until it is surfaced by the child. In such instances, the child would have to be involved in the hearing. And our proposed process to deal with the claim without involving the child will not apply.",28,1159,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01159
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"So, we cannot do away with this requirement of official records. But as society becomes more aware of family violence and more willing to report it, this may benefit more people.",29,1160,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01160
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the statistics on the number of instances the law has been unfairly used against the children. About one in three cases at the Tribunal involve accounts of abandonment, abuse or neglect. The majority were dismissed.",30,1161,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01161
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Ms Janet Ang asked about the number of cases that have come under the Act since it was first passed. There have been around 2,500 cases under the MPA since 1996. She also asked about the number of cases that will come under the new amendment and whether these would be dismissed if the amendments were in force. We do expect that a sizable proportion of cases will not have official records of abuse, neglect or abandonment but many of them would likely be dismissed subsequently by the Tribunal when it hears the parties. But for the few that do, it certainly makes a big difference for them.",31,1162,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01162

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"The Act, when it was first passed, was to solve the practical problem of maintenance for needy elderly parents. That is very much still the core of the Act today, but time and experience have revealed how often this practical problem cannot be resolved in isolation from other issues in the family relationship.",33,1164,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01164
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"The power to make non-monetary directions is new, but it is one that will be given to a Tribunal that has a long history and experience with adjudicating maintenance cases and well-developed institutional practices. It is a Tribunal that knows how to use this legislative tool to make families better off.",34,1165,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01165
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"With regards to Ms Yeo Wan Ling's query if non-monetary directions could in some sense be introduced at the conciliation stage, the answer is, of course. As noted by Ms Yeo herself, the Commissioner is not able to issue orders to the parties as this lies with the Tribunal. However, the Commissioner can and does refer the parties for counselling and other social services, with their consent.",35,1166,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01166

2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"The Maintenance of Parents Act is an Act that is enacted for the small category of needy and neglected parents, but in its effect, it touches everyone one way or another because we are the children of parents and many of us are parents ourselves.",37,1168,2023-07-04-T-017-S-01168
2023-07-04-T-017,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"As mentioned by Ms Carrie Tan, many today do not wish to burden their children and will not come to them for help.

2023-07-04-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Transport how does the Ministry ensure that major construction works by Government agencies which cause road closures in estates are well-coordinated and do not result in a waste of resources or cause further inconvenience to motorists.,1,1184,2023-07-04-T-020-S-01184
2023-07-04-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Road Opening Coordination Committee, which comprises Government agencies, such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Housing and Development Board, JTC and utility service providers, coordinates and consolidates construction or utility works which may require road excavation. Members circulate their planned works about six months in advance – with the intent to minimise road excavations. In most cases which require road excavations, LTA typically limits the closure to one road lane and provide replacement lanes wherever possible, so that the rest of the road can still be kept open for motorist access. This helps to avoid multi-lane closures and repeated road excavation works along the same stretch of road.",1,1185,2023-07-04-T-020-S-01185
2023-07-04-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In rare circumstances of major construction works which require more space, closing off roads to traffic may be required. For example, the construction of the Cross Island Line (CRL) Loyang Station and Loyang Viaduct required the partial closure of Loyang Avenue between Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Loyang Way. In such cases, LTA will carry out impact assessments to ensure that alternative routes are available, and their traffic loads are manageable. If necessary, additional mitigation measures, such as widening of surrounding roads and adjustments to traffic lights timing on the alternative routes, are also implemented to ensure safety and to minimise the impact on traffic. Engagements with affected stakeholders, including motorists, will also be carried out so that the public is aware of the changes and can make adjustments accordingly.",2,1186,2023-07-04-T-020-S-01186

2023-07-04-T-023,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Measuring mental well-being in the workplace is not straightforward as mental well-being is a continuum, ranging from normal to at-risk to being diagnosed with a mental health condition.

These recommendations range from improving mental well-being support systems and work-life harmony strategies for all employees to improving employment support services, training and job opportunities for persons with mental health conditions.

As I had explained previously, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes in the foreign exchange market by purchasing US dollars for Singapore dollars to ensure that the trade-weighted exchange rate stays within MAS’ chosen monetary policy parameters. MAS thus accumulates OFR in the process.2 The incipient expansion in base money caused by OFR accumulation is, in turn, sterilised through MAS' money market operations.
