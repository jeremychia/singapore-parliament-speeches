2023-07-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current per capita cost of running Day Activity Centre services for adults with disabilities with moderate to high needs; and (b) what is the current per capita grant provided by the Government for such Day Activity Centre services.,1,1,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00001
2023-07-06-T-001,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the per capita cost of running Day Activity Centre (DAC) services varies, depending on each centre’s programming and operational considerations.",1,2,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00002
2023-07-06-T-001,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Government funding to DACs is tiered according to the care needs of clients. Government funding to DACs is also means-tested, depending on each client’s income level. In FY2022, the average amount of Government grants provided to DACs was about $14,000 per client.",2,3,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00003
2023-07-06-T-001,Eric Chua,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Besides funding from the Government, DACs also receive funding from the community, such as through Tote Board and their own fund-raising.",3,4,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00004
2023-07-06-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Ms Denise Phua.,1,5,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00005
2023-07-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for always helping this sector. There are issues on the ground. A lot of the charities that are running services for the moderate to high needs individuals with disabilities are facing a lot of challenges on the ground, based on this current funding model. I think the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has been trying to help, but the challenges remain.",1,6,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00006
2023-07-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"May I request the Ministry to convene a workgroup that comprises MSF, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the disability agencies to deeply analyse what is the issue, what is the beef all about and why are there so much noise, so many worries and challenges? And then, to identify what are some alternate and more innovative financing models for DACs for disabled adults with moderate to high support needs.",2,7,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00007
2023-07-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Debating at a very general level and asking Parliamentary Questions (PQs) and replying to PQs at this level is not going to solve matters. The reason is that the costs are indeed high. Although the average grant is about $14,000, some of the costs can go up to about $30,000 per year.",3,8,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00008
2023-07-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"There are also issues like fee cap and you cannot charge that much sometimes. The funding is completely means-tested and, therefore, average and higher-income households are often discouraged from using the services. They will then keep their children at home and that is not always the best quality of life. And later on, there will be more costs.",4,9,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00009
2023-07-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"So, the Ministry should really study alternate models, such as providing a universal base subsidy, with additional means-testing subsidy. This is what, I think, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, when he was MSF Minister actually looked at. So, there are some models that can be considered. If we do not solve this problem, then, cohorts of graduates from the special schools with mid to high needs are really going to suffer. So, I hope the Ministry will look into this deeply with those of us who really want to solve this issue.",5,10,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00010
2023-07-06-T-001,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I share the passion of the Member and I really applaud the Member as we can see, from her very spirited delivery of her supplementary questions. I share that passion as well in doing more for the community, especially for those with moderate to severe needs. I totally agree with her that staying at home, not consuming any of these services, is not going to be the way to go.",1,11,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00011
2023-07-06-T-001,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,"She mentioned the point about fee caps. We introduced that in October 2021. That helped about half of the community with some of the fees. The fee cap is anywhere between $20 and $710. Of course, there is much more that can be done. This year, we will be piloting the Enabling Services Hub. We will be launching that by the second half of this year. We will provide learning, social activities as well as respite care at locations that are closer to where persons with disabilities, including those with moderate needs, as well as their caregivers, live.",2,12,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00012
2023-07-06-T-001,Eric Chua,Mr Eric Chua,We take the Member's points on board and we look forward to that continued engagement and exploration with the community and the Member herself to see what better we can do for the community.,3,13,2023-07-06-T-001-S-00013
2023-07-06-T-002,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,–,1,14,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00014
2023-07-06-T-002,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,2 To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether he can provide an update on the SPH Media Trust committee’s review of overstated circulation numbers of its publications; and (b) what are the measures that SPH Media Trust and the Government will take to prevent similar incidents in the future.,2,15,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00015
2023-07-06-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Communications and Information in respect of the SPH Media Holdings Board’s Audit and Risk Committee findings published on 16 June 2023 (a) what is the timeline for SPH Media Group to implement the recommendations; (b) whether the Ministry will impose additional obligations on the group to tighten accountability; and (c) whether all the overstated circulation figures and consequent financial impact have been corrected.,1,16,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00016
2023-07-06-T-002,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information with respect to SPH Media Group’s filing of a Police report over overstated circulation figures of SPH news publications after potential offences were flagged in an investigation by its audit committee (a) whether the Police has classified the Police report as one that discloses offences for investigation; (b) if so, what are the offences; and (c) how will the Police treat the key investigative findings by SPH Media Group’s audit committee, which include conclusions on the state of knowledge on the part of various SPH officers in relation to the inflated circulation numbers.",1,17,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00017
2023-07-06-T-002,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Communications and Information in respect of the investigation report issued by SPH Media Group’s audit and risk committee on overstated circulation numbers of SPH news publications (a) whether the steps that have been recommended to be undertaken by SPH Media Group in the report are assessed to be adequate; (b) whether regulatory action is being considered; and (c) whether any new regulation is being contemplated to tighten reporting standards by media groups on circulation numbers and other key information to ensure accountability for the same.,1,18,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00018
2023-07-06-T-002,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information in view of the findings and recommendations in the recent report by the Audit and Risk Committee of SPH Media Group, what are the lessons and safeguards that the Ministry will take on funding to SPH Media or other entities in the future.",1,19,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00019
2023-07-06-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Communications and Information in view of the report released by the Audit and Risk Committee of SPH Media Holdings Pte Ltd (a) whether the Ministry still plans to continue its S$900 million funding support for SPH Media Trust over the next five years; and (b) how will the Ministry ensure that such monies are spent prudently with good accountability and oversight.,1,20,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00020
2023-07-06-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether there is a need to set up a Committee of Inquiry to reveal the cause of Singapore Press Holdings (SPH)’s overstatement of its daily circulation numbers; (b) whether the Ministry will consider revealing to the public the companies that are involved in assisting SPH to overstate the circulation numbers; and (c) what are the lessons learnt to prevent such occurrences.,1,21,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00021
2023-07-06-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Government's funding agreement with SPH Media Trust has been concluded and if any funds have been disbursed; (b) if so, whether these funds will be re-assessed in light of the report of the Audit and Risk Committee of SPH Media released on 16 June 2023; and (c) whether the key performance indicators for the funding agreement will include evaluations of SPH Media Trust's risk culture and improvements to its risk management practices and internal controls and processes.",1,22,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00022
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I seek your permission to take Question Nos 2 to 9 in today’s Order Paper?",1,23,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00023
2023-07-06-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Please proceed.,1,24,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00024
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,I will also address the Question filed by Ms Hany Soh,1,25,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00025
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Madam, in the February 2023 Sitting of Parliament, Members had asked a range of questions on this matter. In response, I made three key points.",2,26,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00026
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The first is that the events took place before SMT was formed, when the media business was under SPH Limited (SPHL), a privately listed company.",3,27,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00027
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second point is that whatever happened had no bearing on public funds, because the Government did not have a funding relationship with SMT before the end of 2022. For avoidance of doubt, the first tranche of funding was disbursed in March 2023. In other words, the events preceded the period of funding. No public funds had been involved. Correspondingly, the question of loss of public funds does not arise.",4,28,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00028
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Third, I explained the Government’s reasons for funding SMT’s transformation, which had little to do with circulation. Nevertheless, the Government made it clear that it expected SMT to properly investigate the matter and to give the public a proper account.",5,29,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00029
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,SMT’s Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) has since concluded its investigations and its findings have been extensively reported.,6,30,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00030
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"My update to Members will, therefore, focus on three areas, namely, the ARC’s findings; what SMT will do to address the underlying issues; and what the Government will put in place to ensure public funding to SMT remains prudent and accountable.",7,31,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00031
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me first deal with the ARC’s observations. As Members will have read in media reports, there were three noteworthy findings.",8,32,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00032
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, the overstatement of circulation numbers amounted to around 82,600 average daily copies at August 2021. This is around 10% of overall circulation of their main titles. The ARC did not find any evidence of the involvement of the journalism and editorial departments.",9,33,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00033
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, the ARC found that the accounting impact was not deemed to be material to the financial statements of SPH Media Group for the financial year ending August 2022 taken as a whole. For the financial year ending August 2021, there was approximately S$110,000 in understatement of profits.",10,34,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00034
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Third, there were possible offences committed, based on several findings. Circulation numbers had been reported in a manner inconsistent with established standards, there was improper accounting of revenue and there was a barter deal which was possibly a questionable arrangement, entered into for the sole purpose of inflating circulation numbers.",11,35,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00035
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Consequently, the ARC has recommended that a Police report be filed and the Board has done so.",12,36,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00036
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Ang Wei Neng’s questions on the specific offences being considered, I am unable to give further details as this is now an ongoing Police investigation.",13,37,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00037
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked whether the overstated circulation figures and consequent financial impact have been corrected. After SMT was formed in December 2021, it began internally reviewing the data it took over and rectified the inconsistencies detected. Its accounts since its first financial year ending August 2022 no longer have these inconsistencies. As for the period before SMT was formed, these findings have been made public and further actions to deal with the erroneous figures are matters to be decided by the relevant parties involved then.",14,38,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00038
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Hany Soh filed a related question for a future Sitting. She asked if NLB had been a subscriber of SPH Media’s publications. The answer is yes. NLB’s subscription provides its members with access to various titles published by SPH Media. Neither the subscription rates nor members’ access are related to circulation numbers. There is, therefore, no impact of any kind.",15,39,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00039
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Members Ms Jessica Tan and Ms Tin Pei Ling asked how SMT will take up the ARC’s recommendations. SMT has shared with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) that its follow-up is in three main areas.,16,40,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00040
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"One, they will benchmark their reporting to international standards. They are commissioning the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) to review and advise on their methods for measuring the reach of various titles. These are the metrics that the public, businesses and the Government will be concerned with, to know how many people come into contact with a title’s content.",17,41,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00041
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Two, SMT will improve internal controls, including tightening deal structure and pricing approval procedures, such as requirements for approvals at the appropriate levels; strengthening guidelines and checks for revenue and cost recognition; improving separation of duties among staff to ensure data accuracy and accountability; and commissioning external parties to review its governance, control and compliance measures, with the aim of embedding the enhancements into a new enterprise resource planning system.",18,42,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00042
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Three, SMT will enhance its risk management practices throughout the organisation and review its risk culture. SMT has assured MCI that they will implement these measures immediately and will provide us with regular status updates on a half-yearly basis.",19,43,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00043
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,This leads me to the third set of questions that Members have asked  whether this affects the Government’s funding to SMT.,20,44,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00044
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Reuters Institute Digital News Report is published annually and its 2023 edition released last month is a timely reminder why funding support for mainstream media remains necessary. Even with dozens of news sources easily available, audiences in Singapore consistently turn to our mainstream media when they need something they can trust.",21,45,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00045
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Specifically, trust levels in all the SMT’s major titles remained much higher than the global average – 73% of respondents expressed trust in The Straits Times, up three percentage points from last year. This is against the backdrop of the erosion of trust in news globally, from an already modest 42% last year to 40% this year.",22,46,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00046
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Trusted news media made possible by quality journalism is a public good we cannot afford to compromise on. It is more important than ever when the environment is full of disinformation and sensationalised news.,23,47,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00047
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, SMT can only deliver quality journalism if they can continue to strengthen their capabilities and reach audiences in the digital age. Media consumption has moved online rapidly, disrupting the entire industry. In the same report by Reuters Institute, the share of respondents who consume print news has dropped to 22%, from 53% just six years ago.",24,48,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00048
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"SMT must move decisively into the online space. But the new competencies take time to build and the economics of news media in the digital era do not make it easy for newsrooms to survive, let alone fund new investments.",25,49,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00049
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The costs of running a professional newsroom remain high, and data and technology infrastructure require substantial upfront costs. Yet, revenue streams are a fraction of what they were in the heyday of print media.",26,50,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00050
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Advertising revenue has been squeezed, with a large share going to platforms run by Big Tech. Growing subscription revenue in a world of free news is also challenging – only 15% of Singapore readers surveyed by Reuters Institute are willing to pay for it.",27,51,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00051
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The challenge is even more pronounced for vernacular publications, which have smaller readerships. Yet, it is critical to preserve them. They are an essential part of our multicultural society and unique identity and give voice to our ethnic communities.",28,52,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00052
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Government's funding is, ultimately, to fulfil a public good – that of trusted news media enabled through quality journalism.",29,53,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00053
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MCI is committed to working with SMT to overcome the challenges of disruption and succeed in its transformation. Therefore, to Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Leong Mun Wai's questions, the Government will continue funding SMT at the amounts we committed to.",30,54,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00054
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"This does not, however, mean that we have no additional expectations of SMT in light of this incident. We acknowledge their seriousness in investigating the concerns and for making the findings public. As it is now a matter for the Police to consider, we should turn our focus to making sure SMT will discharge its public duties responsibly on an ongoing basis.",31,55,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00055
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"At the leadership level, the SMT management and board have demonstrated commitment to changing legacy practices. We expect SMT to persist in addressing internal weaknesses and systematically follow up on the required changes.",32,56,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00056
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Members will recall that the circulation data issue emerged because SMT was conducting its own review and due diligence following the transfer of the media business from SPH Limited in December 2021. This point has often been overlooked. This whole set of findings arose out of SMT's own internal review, which no one in particular asked them to do. They themselves felt it was important to start on a clean slate.",33,57,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00057
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"SMT has assured us that it intends to follow up on the ARC's recommendations to ensure organisation-wide accountability and to bring the organisation forward. We welcome the plans SMT has set in motion, including instituting internationally accepted benchmarks and extensively reviewing its governance and control measures. This is an ongoing process and MCI will work closely with SMT to ensure these measures are implemented.",34,58,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00058
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To Mr Murali's question on reporting standards, the key point is to ensure reports are consistent with international best practice. It is in SMT’s own interest to uphold reporting standards, with or without regulation.",35,59,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00059
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Tin and Mr Zhulkarnain asked if we will impose additional safeguards, and Mr Leong asked if we would put in key performance indicators (KPIs) evaluating SMT's improvements in risk management and controls. To assure Members, the funding agreement concluded in March this year already contains measures to ensure accountability, for example  (a) SMT is required to submit specific information on KPIs, including their methodologies and sources. These must be agreed upon and SMT is not allowed to change them without MCI's consent; (b) SMT's KPI performance and financial statements must also be audited by independent external auditors.",36,60,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00060
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, the evaluation of and improvements to internal processes are clearly the responsibility of SMT's executive team. The Government will intervene if there is a case of misconduct or mismanagement of public funding. In this regard, we have built in safeguards that allow the Government to conduct our own ad hoc audits. If serious wrongdoings are found, we have the right to terminate funding.",37,61,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00061
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MCI will also be reviewing the terms of the funding agreement, including the KPIs and funding quantum, at the mid-term juncture. SMT's ability to address these management issues will be taken into consideration.",38,62,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00062
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Madam, I have updated Members on what I can. The outstanding matter of the Police investigation should be allowed to take its course. At its conclusion, the follow-up actions will also be made public.",39,63,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00063
2023-07-06-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Ang Wei Neng.,1,64,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00064
2023-07-06-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply. It must be painful for the journalists to report the wrongdoing of their colleagues, or sometimes it could be their supervisors in the newspapers. I have two supplementary questions.",1,65,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00065
2023-07-06-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The first question is, in the funding formula for SMT, will the circulation numbers be one of the KPIs or is there a KPI for them to increase the circulation because that will add pressure on them? Two, why is it that the names of the companies involved in helping to inflate the circulation numbers are not revealed? Is it because they are subject to Police investigation and the Minister cannot reveal that? In the public interest, we hope that the Ministry can get the papers to release them.",2,66,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00066
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his two questions. Maybe I will take the second question first. Mr Ang had asked why were the names of the companies and the staff who were involved in the potential wrongdoing not made public. As Members will know, the matter has been referred to the Police for investigations. SMT has provided all the findings that the ARC submitted to the Board and this full set of findings would have already been made available to the Police. They include the names of the companies and the people involved.",1,67,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00067

2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Ang asked specifically whether circulation is part of the KPIs. As I explained to Members in February 2023 during the Parliament Sitting and in response to Members' questions, and as I have also alluded to earlier in my response, circulation is a metric that is no longer as relevant. A title that is being circulated in print today can be read by multiple people. And as media move more and more online, it is not so much the circulation that matters. It is the reach. The reach measures how often people come into contact with the contents of a particular title. So, it is reach that is more important.",4,70,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00070

I am heartened to hear that SMT is committed to improve its accountability and its risk measures. I just want to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is prepared to consider ring-fencing an amount out of the $900 million funding support for SMT, to strengthen its internal accountability and to prevent incidents from happening in the future.",1,75,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00075

2023-07-06-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"First, when was the first tranche of the public funds paid out to SPH Media Trust? Was it before or after the completion of the audit committee report?",2,86,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00086
2023-07-06-T-002,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Two, can the Minister confirm that the Ministry is not pursuing the responsibility of the past top management of SPH Limited at the moment?",3,87,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00087
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe Mr Leong may not have been in the Chamber when I addressed his first question. I can confirm that the Government started disbursing funds to SMT in March 2023. At the time, the ARC had not completed its findings. But the important point to note is that by March 2023, only then, funding arrangements with SMT started, whereas the events in question took place well before March 2023. So, I hope that answers the Member's question.",1,88,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00088
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The second question is whether there will be further action taken against those who had been involved in this incident. That is a matter for the Police to decide. A Police report has been filed. The Police have commenced investigations.

2023-07-06-T-002,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I have just one supplementary question. Since the revelation of this incident, is MCI keeping track of whether the international standing and the local public's confidence in SMT's products have dipped subsequent to the announcements? And as what the Minister has shared earlier in response to Member Ang Wei Neng, are we seeing the trend of a drop in terms of the reach of their contents and their engagements with the general public at large as well?",1,91,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00091
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Ms Soh for her question. It is a very good one. In my engagements with SMT, they are themselves equally concerned if the level of trust that is ascribed to them by the public suffers a loss as a result of this incident. I believe this is a key consideration why SMT has taken great pains to ensure that it has undertaken a full and thorough investigation. It took pains to make the findings public; it took pains to be quite careful about whether there was a potential offence to have been committed and they decided not to take any chances but, instead, to file a Police report. So, the seriousness of this incident and its potential impact on the levels of trust that the public has in SMT and its titles, are not lost on its Board as well as the management.",1,92,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00092
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There is another matter that MCI would be equally concerned with and SMT knows this. Henceforth, SMT is in receipt of public funding. Therefore, its ability to be held accountable will be carefully scrutinised, both by MCI as well as by the public. This accountability in relation to funding will include the extent to which SMT has been successful in its transformation, especially towards digital media. It will also be held accountable for maintaining trust. Therefore, the measures that the Member talked about, not only will MCI track, SMT itself will be interested. We will rely on independent reports, such as those carried out by Reuters Institute, but we will also have our own studies to confirm what these independent resources have established as findings.",2,93,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00093
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Accountability to the public also extends to improving governance. If you look at the media reports and also in the ARC's findings, there is a significant portion of the reports that cover governance measures. In other words, SMT is well aware that it is one thing to tell people what the findings are; it is quite another to commit to making improvements. And the improvements in governance essentially are to do three things. It is to make sure that bad things do not happen again; it is to ensure that your systems for controls and contracting, pricing have to be cleaned up, made better; and the other aspect of governance that needs to be improved is also the culture – how people view these kinds of things and their willingness to tolerate them or to speak against them.",3,94,2023-07-06-T-002-S-00094
2023-07-06-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MCI takes all of these matters of accountability seriously. SMT knows it at the Board level as well as the management level. They know that in the reviews that we will be conducting as a part of this funding arrangement, this topic will consistently come up.

2023-07-06-T-003,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Two follow-up supplementary questions. In terms of the types of aquaculture activities being planned, does the Ministry have a view as to whether (a) close-looped recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) farms which may have less impact on the surrounding ecosystems are preferred versus (b) an open-cage sea farming, which, on the other hand, may be more energy-intensive, is a better way forward for Singapore?",2,117,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00117
2023-07-06-T-003,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, while it is time-consuming, I do think that consultation is ultimately a trust-building exercise. But beyond experts, it is also really important to get the public involved and the buy-in from Singaporeans towards the Singapore Food Story and where Singapore food comes from. So, how can the Ministry better educate and consult with the public so that more are aware about Singapore local produce?",3,118,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00118
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Madam, I thank the Member for her two clarification questions. The first one is a technical one on what type of sea farming systems, whether it is RAS, which is a closed containment type, or whether the Ministry would also support open-cage farming. As far as the position of SFA and the Ministry is concerned, we are quite agnostic to the different types of technology that can be used to perform aquaculture activities because different types of sea water and sea space could be conducive for different types of farming methodology. We leave it to the expertise of the various farm operators to decide which platform they are more comfortable with.",1,119,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00119
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"But, of course, we do take into consideration the nature of the sensitive receptacles in the region where farming has to take place, as well as the type of water quality, in advising the operators to choose an appropriate platform that can be used to sustain their operations in a way that is sustainable for the business but, importantly, also sustainable for the marine environment.",2,120,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00120
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Clearly, there are advantages and disadvantages to each type of farming methodology and the Member has also pointed out that RAS, while it may have less impact on the environment, it is a lot more energy-intensive. Yet, at the same time, the advantage it affords is that it has a closed containment system that allows better oxygenation of water and a purer water quality, a more controlled environment that also has the advantage of allowing a more dense stocking of the biomass.",3,121,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00121
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, there are the pros and cons. I think the operator would need to make a business case to decide whether the pros and cons will pan out for them from a business consideration as well.",4,122,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00122
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The open-cage sea farming method will allow for quite dense stocking if it can have a certain depth of water to support that. But the hydrology and the nature of the water in which the cage is to be situated will impact the ability of that method of farming to be viable because there will be a larger impact on the environment. On the other hand, I think it does mean that there are possibly less energy requirements using an open-cage method.",5,123,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00123
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, there are different considerations at play here. What we try to do is to encourage operators to practise good husbandry so that the fish can be kept safe and in a bio-secure manner. And at the same time, to ensure that their practice of growing the fish does not foul the water conditions, by using proper sustainable feeding methodology in their farming practices.",6,124,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00124
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The second question is whether we can engage more with the public to encourage public support for local produce. The answer is yes. In fact, we have started a series of Alliance for Action discussions with stakeholders in the ecosystem, meaning the producers of local produce, together with the off-takers, such as hotels, restaurants, caterers, supermarkets, to come on board this Alliance for Action and talk about how we can integrate the entire value chain from producers to off-takers to help the industry to grow in a more sustainable, business-centric manner.",7,125,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00125

2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As I said, I think it is in relation to the main reply. As long as we think there will be a significant impact on the environment, whether it is open or closed containment, an environmental impact assessment can be carried out.",1,135,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00135
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Having said that, we must also make sure that the requirement for environmental impact assessment is not made overly onerous for operators. I think in more advanced aquaculture countries – for example, on a recent study trip that we had undertaken with our stakeholders to Australia, we did come across this framework which the Australians used to manage aquaculture sector growth in Australia, to also help manage environmental impact. One of the measures they have adopted is that in a region where aquaculture is deemed to be suitable, a broader environmental impact assessment is done on the overall site, but the individual operators within the site are not required to do a very onerous large-scale environmental impact study. Instead, they can have a scoped-down version to make sure that there is still some assessment of the extent of the impact and they complement that with a series of more intensive environmental monitoring measures.",2,136,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00136
2023-07-06-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, it is an approach to make sure that while we want to ensure the process is not overly onerous, a suitable and comprehensive one is done for the overall site; yet, at the same time, post-implementation, there is a series of monitoring to make sure that the ongoing activities are also sustainable for the environment.",3,137,2023-07-06-T-003-S-00137

2023-07-06-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,There are quite a few questions. My response may not be in order. But I just wanted to confirm a few things.,1,149,2023-07-06-T-005-S-00149
2023-07-06-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Firstly, the Member had asked about whether we are still using the AV as at 31 December 2022, I confirm that. But I note there may be applicants who are living in new residences which do not have an AV for 2022. So, the benchmark is 2023. But there are processes in place to ensure that they will not be shortchanged and all those HDB households with zero per capita household income will not be made worse off because of this discrepancy in the AV; they will continue to receive the same amount of subsidies.",2,150,2023-07-06-T-005-S-00150
2023-07-06-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"On the Member's point of considering to remove this, this is a broader point that we are looking at.

2023-07-06-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"I think on the second question, there is going to be a cut-off somewhere.

2023-07-06-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The automobile industry is a very good example. When cars were first made available, their reach was not very wide. People could not afford to buy automotives. Those came a little later. It would probably be the same for AI deployment, too. AI, for example, takes a lot of compute power, so, it is not cheap to implement AI systems. As such, the early implementations will still take time to present themselves.",3,174,2023-07-06-T-006-S-00174
2023-07-06-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"But going back to the example of automotives, it was not immediately obvious to people that what helps to prevent deaths and injuries in a motor vehicle accident would be something like a seat belt. Seat belts came much later. And subsequent to seat belts, then people figured out that having an air bag is quite useful, too. But these kinds of measures, they do not present themselves at the outset. We do not really know what will work. It takes research, it takes a lot of exchange of knowledge and understanding. And then, after a while, we figured out that maybe, seat belts should be made a requirement; maybe air bags should be required as well.",4,175,2023-07-06-T-006-S-00175
2023-07-06-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I would also say that using automotives as an example, it is not just the thing itself, the device itself, the equipment itself, that can have safety features built in. In order to promote road safety, actually, human society figured out that traffic lights are important. We figured out that speed limits are important. But you do not need the same speed limits on highways versus country roads. And then, we figured out that, okay, if you had an ageing population, vulnerable segments of the population, you can do a Silver Zone – well, that is what we do.",5,176,2023-07-06-T-006-S-00176

2023-07-06-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"And back to the Member's question then about whether there will be a central agency that can be effective in regulating AI, it remains to be seen because we have to understand what the useful regulatory measures are in the first place. Keep in mind that we cannot operate only on the basis of domestic interests. All of these regulations have to inter-operate with our counterparts overseas. Otherwise, our businesses will find it very difficult to meet the requirements when they operate in different jurisdictions. So, international standards, what will be useful, these things will be developed.

For instance, under Sport Singapore (SportSG), there is SportCares, which reaches out to youths from low-income families through sports.

2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Second is because the desire to share the risks of the project between two parties.

What does the private sector contribute to the endeavour beyond their skills? Do the partners expand the market, develop the business?

While such skills may well be lacking at home, it remains unclear why we did not simply put such foreign talents on the payroll. We routinely bring in consultants, experts and managers even in areas where we have some expertise in, such as in finance or technology. Besides, the all-important operational partners of the SportsHub PPP were either local or had been based here for an extended period  venue operations fell under Global Spectrum Pico, a tie-up that includes a local company, and its facilities management was overseen by DTZ, whose presence in Asia is due to another Singaporean firm, Edmund Tie.",31,303,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00303
2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Perhaps, then, it comes down to the second justification, which is a desire to share risks.

One reason that the Government offered for pursuing the PPP approach in the first place was that it did not have the expertise. What assures us that it has the expertise now to successfully run a world-class sports and events venue? If it does not – and I am sympathetic to how we should not necessarily expect civil servants to possess such talent – will we then go the route of hiring external experts and, if so, why was this not done in 2008?",39,311,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00311

To do this, we must step back and scrutinise the budget just a little bit, so that we are working off a common context.",45,317,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00317
2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"I promise I am not going to circulate any more handouts, but I will quickly summarise. In the latest Budget estimates, SportSG currently accounts for the ongoing expenditures of a little less than $391 million, with development expenditures of close to $123 million. This comes to $514 million. There is a separate budget line for sports programmes, with an operating expenditure of $41 million and development expenditure of $470,000. Taken together, we devote just about $556 million, or half a percent of total fiscal expenditures, to sport.",46,318,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00318
2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Of this, the Sports Hub consumed around $57 million in fiscal 2022, in the form of capital grants. There was an extraordinary development expenditure charge of close to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022, which, presumably, was the upfront termination fee. But there are additional operational costs of $800 million which will have to be incurred through till 2035. I am assuming that these will be accounted for on an annual basis and will show up in the Budget Statements in future, but I am happy to stand corrected if I am incorrect.",47,319,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00319

2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"As it turns out, the general expenditure on recreational and sporting services for the EU as a whole amounted to 0.7% of all general government expenditure, a share very similar to ours. Japan spends a mere 0.02%, and yes, you heard that right, of its government budget on sport. And in Korea, the entire Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism, which notably includes massive expenditures on promoting Korean culture via Hallyu, comes to only 1.3% of the national budget, with sports accounting for just 0.3%.",49,321,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00321
2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Yet, these countries have performed more admirably on the international sporting stage than we have, even taking into account their larger populations. Ironically, we are ranked the best in the world for a sport, tchoukball, that does not have a national association.

The poor management of sports facilities is merely symptomatic of a more general inefficiency of public spending in sports, which, in turn, not only contributed to a failure of the PPP, but spills over into poorer sporting outcomes as well.",51,323,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00323

In doing so, we not only provide them with the security of knowing that our country has their back when they compete, but even after they do, which, in turn, allows them to push themselves before they even start.

At the SEA Games, our Team Singapore had bagged a total of 158 medals  51 golds, 43 silvers and 64 bronzes.

My heartiest congratulations go out to our medal winners for their triumph and bringing pride to our country, also to our national athletes who had bettered their personal bests at the Games as well as those who fought hard against formidable opponents.

For the 32nd SEA Games and 12th ASEAN Para Games, we celebrated the continued success of our swimmers both at the SEA Games and the Para Games and we rejoiced at the resurgence of runner Shanti Pereira – among other wonderful wins.

2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, in this speech of mine, I will focus on the circumstances of Singapore Football. I can confidently say that football has the strongest following among Singaporeans as compared to any other sport. Football is also known to be a unifying sport as it brings together the different segments of society, regardless of socio-economic status, race, language and religion. While this is not unique to Singapore, our football culture has its unique characteristics. We have our Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave, named for the location of our former National Stadium, where fans always turned out in droves to support our Lions in every home match when they competed in the Malaysian League and Cup competitions. That experience fostered a sense of our shared bonds and a feeling of oneness and pride of supporting our national teams, as each fan became a part of the Kallang Roar and Wave.",6,336,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00336
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Sadly, Madam, this experience now feels like ancient history. We have not witnessed such exhilarating and tremendous support for our Lions for many years. Many are still painfully waiting for the revival of our Lions, expressing our concerns, sharing views and perspectives, but, regrettably, there are quite a big number who have lost faith and given up after our Lions' poor performance in AFF Championships 2022 and the 32nd SEA Games, followed by two recent uninspiring international friendlies.",7,337,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00337
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, I have, throughout the years, spoken several times in this Chamber on Singapore Football, sharing my perspectives. Speaking in support of this Motion, I would like to again surface mine as well as fellow Singaporeans' observations, concerns, thoughts on the current situation and what can be done for the future of our football. Some of these points are a reiteration and elaboration of what I have said in this Chamber.",8,338,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00338
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, I would like to make it clear that I am neither claiming that I have the solutions to this plight that we are facing, nor do I want to belittle any ongoing efforts in bringing glory back to Singapore. My speech is a small contribution in terms of observations and perspectives in our attempts to Make Singapore Football Great Again.",9,339,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00339
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"To begin with, let us look at where Singapore currently stands in the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) rankings. Our men's national team is currently ranked at 158th place. The highest ranking we ever attained was 73rd in 1993, while the lowest is 173rd in 2018 and our average is 127th. At the peak of our FIFA ranking, our men's football national team in 1993 was made up of popular footballers, such as Fandi Ahmad, V Sundramoorthy, Malek Awab, Nazri Nasir, Rafi Ali and other excellent players.",10,340,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00340
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"This means that in the three decades since we achieved our highest ranking, we have dropped by a remarkably disappointing 85 places, which is also 31 places below our average. Since we hit bottom in 2018, we improved by 15 places in five years. But this minor improvement is a small consolation for the players and fans who are struggling to understand how we have failed to improve over the years despite all the efforts put in. Our recent results demonstrate that where many other countries in the region have improved, Singapore football has fallen behind.",11,341,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00341
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, the right efforts are needed to formulate the right programmes and approaches to better our football situation. We need to see what had worked and what did not work in the past, so that we can dissect, review, finetune and come up with the best efforts and measures in improving our football.",12,342,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00342
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I believe any changes that need to be made should start with setting of a Goal or Vision for Singapore Football. I believe that both the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) and the Government understand this. In 1998, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had this vision, Goal 2010, to qualify for the World Cup in that year. We obviously did not make it, but we had a brief glimmer of hope when our junior Lions won third place during the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) hosted in Singapore. That team, coached by former player Kadir Yahaya, seemed to hold promise for a brighter future in Singapore football. I will speak more on that unfulfilled promise later.",13,343,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00343
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"More recently, in August 2019, it was reported in the media that the then-Vice President of FAS, Mr Edwin Tong mentioned that, I quote, ""FIFA World Cup 2034 will be a realistic goal for Singapore."" On this matter, I had asked the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) through a Parliamentary Question in September 2019, as well as in my Committee of Supply (COS) 2020 cut on FAS' strategic plans in achieving this goal. MCCY's replies were that the Ministry was waiting for FAS to advise them on their plans.",14,344,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00344
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Nonetheless, in March 2021, FAS, as reported in the media, shared that the World Cup 2034 is an ""aspirational target"". Pertaining to World Cup 2034, I would like to seek two clarifications. One, FAS has announced in August 2019 that World Cup 2034 is a realistic goal. Meanwhile, in March 2021, FAS set it as an ""aspirational target"". Can FAS or MCCY confirm whether it is the former or the latter?",15,345,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00345
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Second, I would like to, once again, ask for updates from FAS or MCCY on the strategic plans in achieving this realistic goal or aspirational target. I note that there are plans to launch an Under-17 league in 2024, and also to train talent scouts, which were announced in May 2023 during a consultation exercise. But surely, there has to be more to the roadmap.",16,346,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00346
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, aspirational targets are well and good, but there also needs to be a healthy dose of reality injected. If we cannot even advance beyond the group stages in regional competitions, making it to the World Cup is nothing short of a fantasy. And even if, by some miracle, we were to meet that unlikely aspirational target, we are likely to be utterly humiliated.",17,347,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00347
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Before we even think about the World Cup, why not we first try to qualify for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in 2036? Historically, our national football team has participated in the AFC Cup since its inception. However, the only time we have ever qualified for the final round was in 1984 – as the host country. We have never made it past the qualifying rounds on our own steam. Let us set our sights on the AFC Asian Cup and develop a roadmap towards that goal. The roadmap can include milestones, such as winning the AFF Championship and maybe even gold at the SEA Games in a decade. In this manner, there is greater accountability as well. And if we need to revisit the strategy along the way and tweak it here and there, so be it. It is better than setting an aspirational target that is plain unrealistic.",18,348,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00348
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, in any sport, the seeds for success must be sown early. In 2021, FAS announced the introduction of ""Unleash The Roar"" (UTR). Once again, as I did in my COS 2022 speech, I welcome the small steps that have been taken under the UTR project, such as the setting up of School Football Academies and partnerships with global leaders in football, such as clubs from the Spanish premier La Liga.",19,349,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00349
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"This is not the first time that FAS has tried to implement youth development programmes. One example is the Junior Centres of Excellence (JCOEs) which were implemented in 2011. If we go back further, we have the Milo Soccer School. For those who may be too young to remember, the Milo Soccer School was a key youth development programme in the 1980s and 1990s which gave birth to many of our nation's football heroes, among whom are Fandi Ahmad, Nazri Nasir and Lee Man Hon.",20,350,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00350
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"So, we know that youth development is not a new idea for Singapore football. But we also have to confront our failures in youth development, despite the investment of time and resources. In 2015, then-FAS technical director Michel Sablon, in a media report, praised JCOEs and mentioned that with further improvement of this programme, he was confident that Singapore's national team can be like Japan's by 2020. Maybe Mr Sablon was being over-enthusiastic in speaking to the media; maybe his sense of optimism was hopelessly misplaced. We may never know.",21,351,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00351
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"What we do know is that we have failed to make progress in youth development even after all the programmes that were implemented and even after we appointed several reputable technical directors and coaches. There was a time in the 1970s and 1980s when our football team was on par with the current Asian football powerhouses, such as the Japanese and Korean teams. They have advanced considerably; we have not.",22,352,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00352
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The relative lack of progress suggests that there are factors that hindered the effectiveness of our plans and programmes.

2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"To elaborate this point further, I would like to return to our 2010 Singapore Youth Olympic Games (YOG) team, which I mentioned earlier in my speech. This team created history for our football when they won a bronze medal at the tournament. And they seemed to hold great promise, having also secured a 3-2 victory over the Tottenham Hotspur academy team during the team's two-week camp in England in their preparation for YOG 2010.",24,354,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00354
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The players from that tournament were dubbed a ""Golden Generation"" not only for achieving a milestone bronze medal at the inaugural event, but also for their exciting style of play. And yet, a review of their fortunes a decade later told a story of a lost generation of footballers. I would like to quote some of these players sharing their woes, which was reported in one of our local online media. First quote  ""After the YOG, there was no follow-up… We had no coach and we didn't even have a single training session for seven or eight months"". Another quote, ""While much was promised, in terms of on-the-ground work, nothing was really done. We were on our own, things soon went downhill, and eventually they forgot about us"".",25,355,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00355
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, I am aware that excellence at the youth level does not always translate at the senior level. Nevertheless, I believe we need to pose some hard questions, identify where we have previously gone wrong and rectify these errors as we commit towards a long-term youth development programme that will not lead to another ""Golden Generation"" turning into a ""Lost Generation"".",26,356,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00356
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, I mentioned earlier in my speech that Singapore football has its unique features, such as the Kallang Wave and the Kallang Roar. There are other, less positive, unique aspects to Singapore football which we need to address if we are to progress towards success.",27,357,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00357
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I have touched on this issue previously. In 2019, I noted that former national player and coach Fandi Ahmad had made reference to a ""unique ecosystem"" in Singapore football which he felt was important for the coach of our national team to understand. In response to Fandi's comments, FAS had cited our small population, land constraints and the competing commitments, such as National Service and academics, which our young players have to juggle, compared to their peers globally and regionally, who are more likely to be full-time professionals.",28,358,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00358
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I believe these ""unique"" factors remain relevant today.

2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),The issue of National Service has been thoroughly debated in this House and I acknowledge the various allowances for deferment or disruption of National Service obligations which the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has provided for our athletes competing at a high level. Balancing our defence needs with our sporting aspirations is necessary and possible.,30,360,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00360
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"As for our other unique features, I would like to know if the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) has conducted study visits and reviews of countries who face similar population constraints as Singapore and what lessons have been learnt and perhaps implemented into our own development planning. I had cited Iceland, whose football team made it to the 2018 World Cup despite their small population.",31,361,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00361
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, Croatia is another footballing nation that we could also learn from. A country with a population of around four million, it has been achieving great success in international football. The Croatian football team joined FIFA in 1994, ranked 125th. They rose to third place with their first World Cup appearance in 1998, making them the fastest, most volatile ascension in FIFA ranking history as well as the youngest team to ever occupy the top 10 of the world ranking.",32,362,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00362
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Another point I would like to share which could spur our football is about providing better support in terms of employment or career path for our national players upon their retirement from football. I brought this up as I met and spoke to a couple of Singapore's ex-internationals who shared that they do not encourage their children to pursue their dreams to start a football career. When asked why, their short reply, ""No future."" Their concern is what would become of their children after their short career stint in football. Madam, this is a real and valid concern.",33,363,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00363

2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, the final point I would like to make is to reiterate the call I made in this year's COS which is that FAS and other relevant stakeholders engage in an open conversation, a large scale one similar to our national conversation, with local players and coaches, both current and former, and to add on also local football fans and enthusiasts. The sporadic and occasional closed door consultations FAS has held is of limited value and has the risk of creating an echo chamber.",36,366,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00366
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"In May 2023, FAS announced that it will convene a review panel after the dismal performance at the SEA Games. I support this effort. However, I would propose that this review does not only look into our dismal performance at the SEA Games but instead do a review of Singapore football as a whole, a review that will look into making Singapore football great again. And if it means we need to tear down FAS and rebuild from the ground up, so be it.",37,367,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00367
2023-07-06-T-013,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, I think this proposed effort is worth the time, resources and energy. As I have mentioned in the earlier part of my speech, football is a unifying sport as it brings together the different segments of society regardless of socio-economic status, race, language and religion, making Singapore football great again will bring the revival of Kallang Roar and the Kallang Wave which our nation has been patiently waiting for almost three decades.

2023-07-06-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Right off the bat, it is important to recognise that there are certain obligations involved when an athlete competes under the national flag. There are rules to follow. However, as they are highly competitive individuals, it is not unusual to find that sports attract its fair share of the strong-minded and the strong-willed. In fact, this element of their character is sometimes the ""X"" factor that also pushes them to surpass their opponents.",10,379,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00379
2023-07-06-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"History is replete with such headstrong characters, such as the great Muhammad Ali, whose showmanship both in and out of the ring and incredible ability combined to define him. To say that he routinely thumbed his nose at authority is probably an understatement. In March 1966, he consciously objected to being drafted to serve in the Vietnam War and earned the ire of those in authority, which he referred to as the ""white establishment"". His sense of universal justice was captured for posterity in his famous words, ""Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam, while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?""",11,380,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00380
2023-07-06-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Arising from his personal stand against the war, he was systematically denied a boxing licence in every state in the US and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight professionally from March 1967 to October 1970, when he was aged 25 to almost 29 – the best years of his sporting life – as his legal battle worked its way through the US criminal justice system until his conviction was overturned in 1971.",12,381,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00381
2023-07-06-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In many sports, people wear their hearts on their sleeves. In Singapore's recent past, national footballer Noh Alam Shah was one such individual. Whenever I can, like many Singaporeans, I make it a point to watch the Singapore Lions in action. Noh Alam Shah gave his heart and soul when in national colours. But he had a temperamental side and was involved in violent conduct – conduct which cannot be condoned. Once, he was banned by the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) from football for 12 months, with the sentence cut to seven months on appeal.",13,382,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00382

After Singapore's 7-0 loss to Malaysia in football at the last SEA Games, much fan frustration was directed at the management team of FAS. One commentator on Instagram told the current FAS Acting President Bernard Tan to resign. Bernard Tan responded by challenging the individual to meet face-to-face, something he later apologised for.",14,383,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00383

My last substantive communication with him was to congratulate him on his performance at the recently concluded SEA Games. Not only did he win silver for the 10,000 metres, he earned plaudits in Singapore and the region for a spontaneous display of sportsmanship, passing his own cup of water to his Indonesian opponent, whom he was in neck-to-neck with, when the Indonesian dropped his water bottle.",17,386,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00386

He had previously won the gold medal for Singapore in the marathon at the SEA Games, both in 2015 and 2017. His latest non-selection will seriously curtail his ability to run and medal for Singapore ever again. Unlike fixed term suspensions for violent conduct or criminal offences, SNOC's blanket non-selection forces his sporting career into limbo for an unknown period.",18,387,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00387
2023-07-06-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"From publicly available information, the latest non-selection for the Asian Games is a result of public comments he made online. Thirty-six pages of documents allegedly leaked to The Straits Times detailed posts and comments that SNOC took issue with. According to a Rice Media article dated 17 June this year which was titled, ""Soh Rui Yong isn't perfect and he should not have to be"", Rui Yong responded to SNOC's objection by removing the post in question. This did not placate SNOC and he was still not selected.",19,388,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00388
2023-07-06-T-013,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The same article says that Rui Yong was not given a chance to clarify his post before the SEA Games' Appeals Committee.

I wish to restate that it is not unreasonable for SNOC to expect our sportsmen and women to exhibit discipline. SNOC must have the authority to bar athletes after a disciplinary panel has heard the affected athlete out, consistent with the principles of natural justice. But I ask that SNOC take a more forgiving attitude towards Soh Rui Yong.",21,390,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00390

I tried to find out if an NSA for darts still exists and it does not appear that one does.

This achievement is a strong testament to the early fruits of our local youth development efforts.",16,557,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00557

To help them balance schoolwork with sports, the Singapore Sports School provides a flexible and athlete-centric academic approach around the athlete’s training and competition schedule. At the end of the day, athletes are still able to earn their diplomas and degrees while playing table tennis competitively. Ten out of 13 national team players are alumni of the Singapore Sports School.",23,564,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00564

2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"Sorry. The first clarification that I have is for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim on the nature of para sports and the economic considerations versus the performance that our para-athletes have in relation to national funding. I am not an economics professor, but there are also positive externalities when it comes to having an economy that is doing well, in terms of healthcare, in terms of care for patients as well. So, I think that also speaks to the talent pool when we talk about the number of athletes representing our para-athlete contingent.",1,585,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00585

When it comes to the whole landscape of para-athletes, we also need to consider that because of our economic stability, safety, national defence, the pool of para-athletes is actually not very large.

I think I, at no point, suggested that our para-athletes were underperforming because we have a small population. If anything, I think the fact that our para-athletic team has done so well is something that we all feel extremely proud of. Later on, I believe some of my Workers' Party colleagues will elaborate more on helping to further improve the diversity and inclusiveness of our sports scene, which includes the para-athletes' performance. I hope this clarifies. Again, I am not entirely clear what the specificity of the Member's quarrel with what I had said earlier was.",1,594,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00594

Exactly the same as our normal athlete team in the sense that they were both ranked seventh in total medal count and Ms Poh Li San mentioned that the regular team secured six, which is correct, if you look at the fact that gold medals are counted differentially. But in the statement that I made earlier on, it was about total medal count. And in total medal count, we had the same performance, which was seventh in both cases of the regular SEA Games as well as the Paralympic Games.",1,597,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00597

And indeed, I emphasised in the speech that there were many elements, including the fact that we have a small population that does affect the relative performance of our national teams, whether in terms of the SEA Games or the Para Games.

Regarding our silat athletes and swimmers, I just want to clarify that for the silat athlete, whether he is aware that the drink-driving incident actually happened on 27 November 2022 and the silat competition at the SEA Games actually happened on 18 May 2023. So, that falls outside the Code of Conduct and the Athletes' Agreement.",1,610,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00610

While I note the points he is making, they do not detract from the larger point vis-à-vis those two issues which I raised, which was that SNOC has a track record of looking and displaying a forgiving attitude towards athletes who may have committed transgressions.

But I was on the Selection Committee in 2021 when we decided not to send Soh Rui Yong for various reasons.

I believe that Singapore Athletics believes that he still abides by the Code of Conduct and they still select him and nominate him for these games. So, he can still compete, he can still break national records, but not at the major games. Where leniency was given, he took advantage of the situation. He broke his, I guess, commitment.

So, I am appealing also as his Member of Parliament. And if SNOC can take another look at him, I am not out of order, I believe, to raise this matter. And – given that the matter actually goes far beyond, in the eyes of many, just to be an issue of transgressions – I hope more senior members of our sporting fraternity can come in and try to lower temperatures, so that athletes like Soh Rui Yong can participate and fly the flag proudly.",1,625,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00625

2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"I thank Mr Leon Perera for his comments in his speech. I have just one clarification on the support for athletes who are not in popular sports. He cited bowling as well as billiards, with Peter Gilchrist, Aloysius Yapp, Shayna Ng as well as Cherie Tan. They are all spexScholarship holders. SportSG actually does give them funding and support, both in sports science as well as grants. So, I just wanted to understand whether he is aware that spexScholarship does exist for athletes in this situation.",1,629,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00629
2023-07-06-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I thank the Nominated Member, Mr Mark Chay, for his clarification. I did, in my speech, allude to my awareness of the existence of sports scholarships and I mentioned a few, nor in my speech did I claim that there is no Government support for these less well-known sports. In fact, I highlighted, in the case of cue sports, the Government funding that is given to them.",1,630,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00630
2023-07-06-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My point for the part of my speech about less well-known sports is that we do have top performers in some of these sports. It is not very widely known or well-known, and there is room to do more, in terms of trying to understand why they have succeeded, unpacking the reasons, replicating the factors and ecosystem and building on that.",2,631,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00631
2023-07-06-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"And I would like to ask the hon Member Mr Chay if he feels that there is no room for improvement in terms of the support – whether as a Government, as a society, the NSAs or SportSG – given to less well-known sports. Are we in a state of perfection? Does he feel that there is absolutely no room for improvement at all? If so, I welcome his views.",3,632,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00632

2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"I would like to thank the hon Member for his comments. Yes, I do think that there is room for improvement and there is definitely no perfect system. I am paraphrasing from yesterday. There are a lot of wonderful systems out there, but we have got to do the right system for what works in Singapore, and we have success in the systems that we have right now. Obviously, we need to continually improve on them.",1,635,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00635
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"Yes, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we definitely need to continue to improve on them and support our athletes.

2023-07-06-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Sorry, again. I acknowledge that, of course, no system is perfect. I think we all acknowledge that. My colleague Assoc Prof Jamus Lim presented data on the performance of different countries in sporting excellence, government spending relative to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. And I think Singapore is below the trendline in that. Would the hon Member recognise that or does he feel that the data is wrong or he feels that it is not appropriate to make that comparison, to analyse the data in that way?",1,642,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00642
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I recognise the hon Member's comments and I recognise that there was a fancy chart with GDP, but we cannot look at athlete performance juxtaposed to GDP alone.",1,643,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00643
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"There are many different factors and, if you ask me, high performance takes time. We celebrate the accomplishments of our aquatic fraternity; we came back with 23 gold medals at the Southeast Asian Games. But there was a time when our men's team did not have a gold medal after Ang Peng Siong, 1993, where he swam in the 50-metre freestyle. I was a Primary 5 kid, a basket kid, taking the track suits out. But that was inspiring.",2,644,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00644

2023-07-06-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Just a very quick clarification for the Member. Does he feel that we should exercise exactly the same modicum of patience with all the other areas that Singapore rightly excels in on the international stage? Whether we are happy that we have taken 20 years and, if anything, we have fallen much further away in terms of the relative performance of our football team, even as we have gotten relatively richer?",1,648,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00648
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"I thank the hon Member for his comments. Definitely for sports, I say we need to take a measured approach where we are very young in this whole idea of sports administration and high performance. We started building our facilities back in 1960s and 1970s only. We were playing football on the Padang and Farrer Park. Although right now we have a lot of wonderful facilities, the programming needs to kick in.",1,649,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00649
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"And if you look at high performance, you are looking at 2029 Southeast Asian Games or the Olympics in 2028. You are looking at the Secondary 1, Secondary 2 kids today and they take time to mature.",2,650,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00650
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"So, we may have the facilities here, but you still need to continue to grow and groom these kids to be able to give them appropriate level competitions in order to produce results in 10 years' time.",3,651,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00651
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"That is just my view – you cannot expect the results to come immediately, especially when you talk about high performance, dynamic sports like football. I do not claim to be an expert but when you are dealing with 11 men on one team and 11 men on the other team, a lot of things can happen.",4,652,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00652
2023-07-06-T-013,Mark Chay,Mr Mark Chay,"I used to be the CEO of Singapore Hockey Federation. I can tell you that team sport is extremely complex. It is not like individual sports, where it is one person on the track, seven in a single lane. You have to talk about having everyone performing in sync, in concert, together.

2023-07-06-T-013,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Sporting success would thus be different things to different people. We should thus not define sporting success only by medals won or quantitative targets attained. Just as sports and sporting activities can play multiple roles in our community, such as fostering national pride and connecting or bonding people from all walks of life, we should also measure sporting success by looking at whether or not these broader goals have been met or attained via sports.",2,656,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00656

2023-07-06-T-013,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Athletes undergo gruelling challenges in their sporting pursuits. Through these, he picks up the skills that are valuable to the corporate world. This is truly education outside the classroom. Some skills our athletes might pick up include  resilience, the ability to bounce back from failure; fortitude, the strength to keep going when the going gets tough; humility, the ability to embrace critical feedback in their continuous journey of self-improvement; and also cooperation and empathy, especially for those involved in team sports.",5,659,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00659
2023-07-06-T-013,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I believe that many corporate partners recognise this and do step forward to support our athletes in their professional life beyond sports, and this is critical as the shelf life of a professional athlete is relatively short compared to many other professions.",6,660,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00660

2023-07-06-T-013,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the pressure that our athletes face can be overwhelming. I would like to talk a little now on the provision of mental health support. I am heartened that Athlete Life Management is a key area of focus for SSI and the National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI).

2023-07-06-T-013,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"And like in education, supporting our athletes’ total well-being is an effort requiring partnership across multiple stakeholders – coaches, psychologists, National Sports Associations (NSAs) and even parents. My daughter is an active junior competitive swimmer. She is 11-plus, but, as a parent, I have already seen the kind of stresses and pressure that competitive athletes at that level go through – training six times a week, two hours per session, more than 50-60 laps each time in the pool at six in the morning, juggling their homework and so on. So, I am truly heartened and am a big advocate of making sure that we have that mental and emotional wellness support for our athletes as well, both young and the not-so-young.",12,666,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00666

This recognises the continuing nature of reviews and goal-setting for our high-performance sports and our sports system, regardless of any Motion raised.

The original Motion mentioned just one of several objectives, for example, goals for sporting success, where the last limb can be construed as being about medals or qualifications for international tournaments. I think success should be measured beyond just that one particular quantitative marker. Also, our broader objectives of sports are to help athletes reach their maximum potential and also to broaden participation in sports, rally our communities, foster national pride and cohesion, or even just about being the best version of yourself that you can be. As I tell my daughter, it is not about winning the medals, it is about improving your personal best every time you go into the pool. All of us, we have got to have that personal best – amateur sportsmen, professional sportsmen – and I believe that we should, therefore, proceed along these lines.",4,690,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00690

2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),We call on the Government to continue to review Singapore's sporting ecosystem and identify opportunity areas where we can provide more support to help our nation and our athletes achieve greater success in the coming years.,4,702,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00702

2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One area of review in our sporting ecosystem is in the selection of athletes to represent Singapore at international sporting competitions, such as the SEA Games and Asian Games.",6,704,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00704
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"This has been the source of some controversy recently, with marathoner Soh Rui Yong being omitted from the national team for the forthcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou because of his controversial comments on social media.",7,705,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00705
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"While this has been extensively covered by the Leader of the Opposition and clarified further by Mr Mark Chay, however, please allow me to speak up one more time for Soh Rui Yong.",8,706,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00706
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"At the recent SEA Games, Soh Rui Yong has once again shown that he is a talented and record-setting runner. He has demonstrated the potential to continue bringing glory to Singapore at the Asian Games.",9,707,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00707
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"However, he cannot do so because he has supposedly not met the SNOC's selection criteria, which encompass athletes' attitudes, behaviours, general conduct and disciplinary history.",10,708,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00708
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),We think this is a very serious matter to disqualify an athlete for non-performance reasons. We call for greater objectivity and transparency in the selection criteria for athletes to represent Singapore at major sporting events. More clarity is needed around the process by which an athlete is disqualified from representing Singapore.,11,709,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00709
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),PSP also believes that all sports associations should be led by people with professional expertise and interest in the sport. This will ensure that Singapore's sporting ecosystem is driven by athletes who know how to succeed in the sport and are committed to have the sport succeed in Singapore.,12,710,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00710
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),Such leaders will be more likely to understand the needs of our professional athletes and be able to work with them to advance Singapore's international standing in these sports.,13,711,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00711
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Another area where we can provide greater support to athletes as a nation is greater flexibility around National Service (NS) obligations, which I have spoken on last August. This would make a great difference to the sporting careers of our male athletes.",14,712,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00712
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Last year, our Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling called for a national dialogue on managing expectations of athletes undergoing National Service.

2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"In 2018 and 2022, the Minister for Defence explained Singapore's deferment policies in this House, which are grounded on the principles of national security, universality and equity. These principles mean that every Singaporean must serve NS at the time he is required to do under the Enlistment Act.",16,714,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00714
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"However, in recent years, there are many Singaporeans who are concerned that many male foreigners are given citizenship without having to serve NS while our male sports talents miss out on the opportunity to develop their sporting careers because they must serve NS.",17,715,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00715
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"In the area of sports, PSP supports allowing a small number of our most talented male athletes to receive long deferments for NS so that they can reach their full athletic potential and maximise the opportunity to bring glory to our nation.",18,716,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00716
2023-07-06-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The policies around such deferments should be determined through a national dialogue around NS deferments. We believe it is timely to have such a dialogue to discuss how the criteria for such deferments can support our young male athletes in achieving sporting success while still being explicit, transparent and fair and satisfy the principles of national security, universality and equity.",19,717,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00717

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),My speech today will focus on the development of high-performance athletes in Singapore. I will delve into some of the challenges faced in the local sports ecosystem and will propose several ideas that I believe will enable Singapore to achieve greater success in the international sporting arena.,4,723,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00723
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Before I continue, I wish to declare my interest in this matter as a parent with a child who trains in a high-performance sports programme supported by SportSG.",5,724,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00724
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Most of us would be familiar with the 10,000-hour rule. This is a concept proposed by Dr Anders Ericsson and popularised by Malcolm Gladwell in his 2008 book, Outliers  The Story of Success. The rule suggests that it takes approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve mastery in a particular field or skill.",6,725,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00725
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"To clock 10,000 hours, an athlete would need to put in three hours a day of practice six days a week, continuously, for over 10 years.",7,726,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00726
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Going by this rule, if an athlete aims to be world-class by the age of 18, they would need to start serious training when they are just eight years old. This does not even take into account the quality of their training and their innate talent, which are important factors for their future success.",8,727,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00727
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In fact, many world-class athletes today started training in the high-performance environment from as young an age as five. Many were handpicked while they were still learning to walk, often by their own parents. In his autobiography, ""Black and White"", Richard Williams describes how he came up with the plan to train his two daughters to become tennis champions before they were even born. We all know how successful Venus and Serena Williams became. There are also many other instances of fraught relationships between parents and their child athletes, even to the point of abuse. And I am not suggesting that Richard Williams' approach is right for every athlete. However, this is the nature of an international competition young athletes are up against.",9,728,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00728
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"For most sports, in order to become a world-class athlete, the period of very high intensity training often starts from the age of 12 or even younger. This coincides with the time Singaporean students are the busiest, preparing for their PSLE, ""O"" and ""A"" levels. Training for just a few hours a week with the school's co-curricular activity (CCA) sports team is not high-performance training and this pace of training will generally limit the students' success in their sport to inter-school sports competitions.",10,729,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00729
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"High-performance athletes are generally expected to put in between 12 hours and 30 hours of high-intensity training each week, with the number of hours increasing with age. One local national sports association (NSA) provides a training volume guideline of 28 hours a week and 27 tournaments a year for 16-year-old male athletes in their sport.",11,730,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00730
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Athletes need to travel overseas, usually during the school term, to take part in tournaments which are necessary for gaining competition experience and earning ranking points. It is extremely challenging for a secondary school student in a mainstream local school to balance this heavy load of training, travel and competition with their studies without burning themselves out physically, mentally and emotionally.",12,731,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00731
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"An exception is found in the Singapore Sports School where academic schedules are customised to accommodate the student athletes' training and competition commitments. The hon Member Poh Li San shared about this earlier, too.",13,732,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00732
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The Sports School has produced some very successful graduates, including badminton player Loh Kean Yew and table tennis player Clarence Chew, who have both won gold for our nation at international competitions. This leads me to my next point  the Singaporean outlook towards the nexus of sports and studies.",14,733,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00733
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In Singapore, the well-established route for young individuals to achieve a comfortable income and provide for their family involved completing their education, graduating from either a polytechnic or university and securing a professional position, preferably in a bank, tech company or law firm.",15,734,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00734
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Becoming a professional athlete, on the other hand, is probably one of the most difficult paths a Singaporean can choose. It is not a ticket out of poverty in Singapore as it is in some countries. Even if we look at some of the highest paying sports like golf and tennis, only athletes ranked in the top 150 or so in the world earn enough prize money to support themselves. Those outside these rankings may struggle to even cover their expenses, which include travel, accommodation, coaching and physiotherapy fees. In lower-paying sports, athletes must depend on salaries paid by their clubs or NSAs to cover their expenses. It is a tough life.",16,735,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00735
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Despite the desire for sports champions in Singapore, pragmatism often leads parents to view pursuing a professional sports career as impractical for their children. Consequently, many talented student athletes choose to enter top mainstream secondary schools through the Direct School Admission programme rather than attending the specialised Singapore Sports School. This is despite the fact that the latter often offers a more favourable environment for balancing both sports and studies.",17,736,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00736
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"However, student athletes enrol in mainstream schools encounter constraints when compared to their peers in the Sports School. The fixed timetables in mainstream schools do not cater specifically to athletes, making it difficult for them to undergo long hours of training and overseas competition. While some mainstream schools offer limited flexibility on an individual basis, such as permitting athletes to skip a week of school for international competitions, the time away from lessons eventually takes a toll on their studies. With this reality in play, we should not be surprised that we continue to have a narrow pipeline of world-class athletes.",18,737,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00737
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The ""academics-first"" approach is one that most Singaporeans have chosen over the years and will continue to choose in the years to come. Given that many high-performance athletes are of school-going age, if nothing is done to shift the youth sports development paradigm, we will continue to see many budding sports stars eventually fizzle out after they complete secondary school.",19,738,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00738
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"How do we shift this paradigm? I would like to offer some suggestions for MCCY, SportSG, NSAs, coaches, schools, parents and student athletes to consider.",20,739,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00739
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"First, given how important academics are to Singaporeans, it is not fruitful to try to persuade them to choose sports over studies. We should, therefore, explore pathways that allow student athletes to pursue both their studies and sports at the highest level. This is possible through what is known as the college pathway.",21,740,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00740
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Most universities in the United States are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, or NCAA. There are three divisions in these sports.",22,741,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00741
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The top tier, known as Division I, runs inter-collegiate championships in 13 male and 13 female sports, including swimming, soccer, track and field, tennis, golf, water polo, field hockey, basketball, volleyball and diving. Many of these are popular sports in Singapore which our athletes compete in during major games, like the SEA Games, Asian Games and the Olympics.",23,742,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00742
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),College sports is huge in the US and has a television audience comparable to the top professional team sports. This popularity attracts commercial sponsors and television licensing rights and is a huge revenue earner for some universities to the tune of some US$30 million a year.,24,743,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00743
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The quality of college sports in the US is so high that many of the best junior athletes from all over the world, including Europe, Australia and China, vie for the opportunity to study in these universities on full athletics scholarships while competing in their sport. Many of these universities have students that win more international championships than many small nations. The University of Southern California, for example, had 65 past, present or incoming student athletes competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, compared to 23 from Singapore. USC athletes collectively won 11 gold medals in those games.",25,744,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00744
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Many of the top performing universities in inter-collegiate sports are also top-ranked academic institutions. They include Stanford UC Berkeley, Duke University of Michigan, UCLA and USC. Harvard, Princeton, UPenn and other Ivy League universities are also NCAA Division I members.

These can cover tuition fees, housing, meals, transport, apparel, equipment coaching, sports science expertise and even academic tutoring for the athletes. By pursuing the college pathway, more Singaporean student athletes can have the opportunity to benefit from the best of both worlds, a top-quality university education and elite level competition in their sport.",27,746,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00746

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Athletes are also much sought after by many companies after they graduate because many employers recognise that athletes' discipline, drive and good time management skills are among the many valuable skills that they bring to the workplace.",31,750,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00750

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"SportSG, NSAs, sports academies, schools and coaches should conduct more sharing sessions and provide more guidance for athletes and their parents on the college pathway.

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"My second suggestion is that the Singapore Sports School should expand its enrolment of students beyond the nine ""academy sports"" and provide a study-and-train environment for more student athletes who can demonstrate their interest and potential to compete at an international level in their sport.",34,753,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00753
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"To make this successful, the Sports School and SportSG need to better market the benefits of their sports and academic programmes to prospective students. The Sports School can arrange more sharing sessions at various primary schools nationwide, in addition to the existing Sports School open house. It could also invite the high-performing athletes in primary schools for holiday camps at the Sports School during the school holidays. These will enable the young athletes and parents to better understand and familiarise themselves with the Sports School. The Sports School will then be able to better attract a critical mass of students in each sport that will, in turn, make the school more attractive to prospective students.",35,754,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00754

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"When Singaporeans turn on their television sets to watch sports, they seldom see their compatriots competing. In fact, it is so rare to see Singaporeans in world-class sports competitions that when it does happen, like when Loh Kean Yew won the badminton world championships in 2021, many of us specifically tuned in to watch them. Unfortunately, in the case of Loh Kean Yew's amazing win, it was so unexpected that even our public broadcaster did not make preparations to broadcast the final match live to Singaporeans.",37,756,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00756
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Matches featuring local athletes in the advanced stages of international competitions should be telecast live on free-to-air television or live-streamed online. During major games, all the matches and races where Team Singapore athletes are competing in should be uploaded to an online video platform like MeWatch or YouTube. There should not just be a daily highlights programme which features a few athletes in action. The media features could include interviews with high-performance athletes sharing their insights about their day-to-day schedules and training. All these will spark interest in the various sports among athletes, fans and commercial sponsors.",38,757,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00757

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Parents have an out-sized influence on their children's sporting ambitions and progress, from a very young age through their growing years. If you are a parent of a talented and athletic youngster, do take the time to listen to and understand your child's motivations and dreams, assess whether they truly love their sport and do not push them to excel in a sport just to ""DSA"" into a good school or, worse, live your own dreams vicariously through them. I say this as a reminder to myself, too.",40,759,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00759

2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"If your child has aspirations to become a world-class athlete, encourage them to pursue their dreams, take the time to find out the available pathways and support them within your means. The path will be less well-trodden than the ones most of their peers are taking and there is no guarantee of success. It is, therefore, important to focus on enjoying the journey, not just the destination.",42,761,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00761
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Madam, sport has the potential to rally our nation together behind a common cause. When Singaporeans cheer in support of our sportsmen and women, listen to Majulah Singapura playing at the podium or see Singaporean athletes giving their all on the field, in the pool or on the court, we all feel an immense rush of pride in our nation. Yet, for a nation as wealthy and as diverse as Singapore, our record of performance in sports on the world stage leaves much to be desired.",43,762,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00762
2023-07-06-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),I have outlined four suggestions aimed at improving Singapore's sporting ecosystem to build a stronger and more sustainable pipeline of high-performance athletes in Singapore. This will help us take steps towards realising our goals for sporting success over the coming decades and for many decades to come. I strongly support the Motion standing in the names of my hon friends Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap.,44,763,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00763

My speech will cover the following four points  first, I support the Motion where we acknowledge the hard work by our athletes and our para-athletes; second, I will highlight why broad-based accessible programming to encourage more people to participate in sports is key in building up our talent pool for high-performance sports; third, I will speak on the need to ensure inclusivity through sports; and fourth, as a lifelong football fan, I hope to offer some suggestions for Singapore's football to, once again, reach the heights of the 1980s and 1990s.",1,765,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00765
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, I would like to begin by congratulating our TeamSG athletes and para-athletes for their commendable results at this year’s Southeast Asian Games and the ASEAN Para Games. TeamSG won a total of 158 medals at the SEA Games while our para-athletes brought home a total of 44 medals. This was our second-best away performance of all time, behind the 2017 ASEAN Para Games.",2,766,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00766
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"While news about our best-performing athletes and para-athletes, especially those who have consecutively broken records, might dominate news headlines and deservedly generate the most hype, we must also not forget the rest of our athletes who did not win medals. Every athlete trains hard and they sacrifice their time with family and friends with every intention of doing their best for themselves and for the country they represent. They were not in the competitions just to make up the numbers.",3,767,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00767
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"The amended Motion, therefore, acknowledges the hard work, blood, sweat and tears of our TeamSG athletes, both past and present.",4,768,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00768
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, to achieve success at the elite sports level, a systematic and comprehensive approach to identify, nurture and develop TeamSG athletes is important. Broad-based accessible programming that encourages sports participation will be a key part of this approach, as we need a broad participation base from which we can identify and develop sporting talent.",5,769,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00769

2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Years ago, in 2011, I started the Delta League programme. It is now a bi-annual youth engagement programme that aims to engage youths through football and keep them meaningfully occupied during the long June and December school holidays.

2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"It is important to have events like these to encourage everyone to come together to play sports, regardless of age, ability and background.

2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Today, as some Members have already highlighted, we cannot even play football at our void decks and many of our neighbourhood school football fields and parks have restricted use. This scarcity restricts the number of local talents that can be groomed and inhibits the organising of more football events and competitions, which then limits the exposure that our players receive. Hence, it is vital for us to invest in the development of infrastructure to provide our athletes with the necessary ecosystem of support and opportunities.",17,781,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00781
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Next, we must improve the way we groom our pipeline of football talents. We need to establish a robust talent scouting and recruitment system to identify early promising players. Only by identifying them early when they are young and by continuously nurturing them can Singapore build a strong pool of players who can contribute to the national team and compete internationally.",18,782,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00782
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"One of the best ways I found in scouting our talents is to search from the grassroots, and the Delta League is one good example. The tournament sees about 2,000 young players every year. And over the years, some of them have been scouted to play at club level and, eventually, some have gone on to train with the national teams. FAS can and should widen its talent scouting and recruitment systems to encompass the many hidden gems in our community. And I welcome the FAS scouts to attend our Delta League matches.",19,783,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00783
2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Third, we must also establish strong partnerships with professional clubs and leagues worldwide to help groom our local talents.

2023-07-06-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),Exposing our local players to different playing styles and allowing them to benchmark their abilities against international competitors can help them better develop their own skills and broaden their knowledge of the game.,21,785,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00785

2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, today, I will speak about the development of Singapore as a sporting nation for all. I believe that sporting success, as the original Motion calls for, should not only be measured in terms of winning medals and doing well in various rankings, but also measured in terms of wider participation in sports across all segments of society.",1,794,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00794
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Specifically, I will talk about how we do on accessibility and participation in sports and how this measurement should form an important part of our national developmental dashboard, an idea I first raised in Parliament in early 2022. I will also touch on inclusion in sports, from how we provide for the mental well-being of our athletes, to the crucial and important role that sports play to work with and support persons with disabilities and also neurodiverse individuals.",2,795,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00795

It tracks sports participation across a few indicators and it is heartening to see that, for once, there appears to be a positive correlation associated with the pandemic  that regular sports participation rates increased to an all-time high of 74% last year. This is clearly an achievement worth celebrating and I hope that this can be maintained.",3,796,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00796
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Yet, we must continue to improve, to look to countries like Norway, where in 2021 a whopping 97% of those aged 16 and above participated in outdoor activities and 86.9% stated that they had participated in various exercise activities.",4,797,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00797

2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Besides the obvious benefits outlined above, I believe participation in sports at any level can teach us many life lessons that will stand us in good stead as we go along our path in life.

It was to be the start of my three-year journey with what eventually became known as the Corpus Terriers, as we cobbled together a ragtag group of students – both undergraduates and postgraduates – to become a good enough team that progressed from the bottom league, to gaining promotion twice to the league above in the university league tables.",10,803,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00803

2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"What participation in these sports taught me was not about winning or losing, but about the importance of perseverance and being there for your teammates. It did not matter if you were out in a nightclub or panic writing an essay until three in the morning the night before. Come 6.30 the next morning, whatever the weather, you were expected to be there on the river, ready to start training, or else you would be the reason the rest of the team was unable to go out on the water.",12,805,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00805

2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The time we spent together as friends, as a team, on the river and the playing fields, more than the hours spent trying to make sense of dense and opaque scientific journal articles, is what I remember when I think of my time at university almost two decades on. They also gave us important lessons in grit, resilience, risk-taking and the importance of having one another's backs – skills that ring through across so many areas of life long after leaving the formal education system. It also teaches us how to deal with often very strong negative emotions in a healthy manner. Experiencing first-hand the physical and mental health benefits of participating in sports made it easier for me to make a conscious effort to carve out time and to seek out suitable sporting activities to fit my current circumstances despite busy work and family schedules, especially here in Singapore.",14,807,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00807
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),What these experiences taught me is that we need to work to ensure that all of us – no matter who or where we are in life – are able to understand the benefits of sports – particularly organised sports – and reap these benefits.,15,808,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00808
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Starting from our very young, we have to continue to work to make sports and physical activity fun for all children and find ways to sustainably incorporate it into daily life in a way that complements and not competes with academic learning. It can be as simple as stopping ourselves from shouting at our young children to stop when they have a sudden impulse to run or jump, but instead pause and ask them how they can run or jump in a manner that is both safe and situationally appropriate. As our children grow up, the sporting ecosystem has to evolve to be supportive and accessible enough to allow them to choose a sport they enjoy and have an interest in, at a level of participation they are comfortable with and that fits into their current life circumstances.",16,809,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00809
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"And while we are on the topic of participation, we also must not neglect the important role of our participation in sports as spectators. While the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) found that there appeared to be high levels of positive responses associated with a sense of national pride in our achievements in sports, how does this translate into attendance at live sporting events? After all, any competitive athlete will tell you that competing live is a truly unique and irreplaceable experience, and that the roar of the crowd is often instrumental in their performance during the match or race, and home support can make the difference between victory or defeat.",17,810,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00810
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Yet, this seems to be an area which we struggle with. One highly publicised example in recent months was the cap that the Football Association of Singapore applied to limit the number of fans for Team Singapore football friendly matches at the National Stadium to a paltry 5,000. Apart from being extremely frustrating for fans, attendance numbers today are also a far cry from the regular 50,000-strong crowds during our Malaysian Cup and Super League halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s. This is also a contrast against the huge queues with fans camping overnight for tickets to matches, which even resulted in a tragic stampede in 1977 which resulted in casualties and even a life lost. Contrast sports event attendance, too, to the fans who flooded the Internet and even started camping from yesterday for tickets for when Taylor Swift will play at the National Stadium next year.",18,811,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00811
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Lack of spectator participation also was an issue when I assisted to organise an international wheelchair Rugby Fours tournament held at Toa Payoh Sports Hall and the Singapore Cricket Club, which was attended by teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Europe. Despite the skilled havoc on the court in play – making for a wonderful spectator experience – we struggled to get more than a handful of spectators to attend the matches in Toa Payoh. This was a point made by Rohit Brijnath, The Straits Times assistant sports editor, who compared this against the 300 to 400 fans who turned up in an earlier leg of the tournament in Palembang. It was a shame, particularly as the Singapore team comprised members with incredible stories that I believe would have been very inspirational to people who actually watched them play. My kids certainly still remember sitting in the stands and watching the matches and talk about it periodically, even today.",19,812,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00812
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"In view of the above, sports spectatorship should be studied as part of the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) and considered a key indicator of national development beyond GDP. Apart from the benefits I outlined earlier, exposure to sports, whether as spectators or otherwise, also exposes us to intangible lessons in terms of the culture surrounding various sports, such as the importance of focus and balance in tai chi and yoga, the importance of harmony in aikido, and the respect for the opponents in a sport like kendo, where participants do not celebrate scoring a point out of respect for your opponent who has after all trained as hard as you have.",20,813,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00813

While I appreciate the need to develop specific hard infrastructure for people with disabilities to participate in some sports, we must put a lot more effort into growing broad, regular participation in sports for them.",21,814,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00814
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"For instance, the last Enabling Masterplan reported that the sports participation rate among persons with disabilities was approximately 50% in 2019, exceeding the target that was set. But the definition of the sports participation rate indicator only tracks whether an individual has participated in any sports or recreational physical activities in the past year. This definition is also different from the one used for the wider population in the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS), which uses the headline definition of regular participation of at least once a week. It would be good to harmonise the indicators used to better understand where we stand.",22,815,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00815
2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Secondly, for people with disabilities participating or wanting to participate in sports at a recreational level, our residents shared that much of our urban environment continues to present significant barriers to participation. Particularly for running, walking and wheelchair use, cycle and walk paths often do not actually meet the Government's walking and cycling design guide specifications, despite these specifications already making large allowances for our urban density. There often does not seem to have any safe passing distance designed for walking and cycling paths for those with disabilities. For example, intra-town cycling paths can be designed to be just two metres in width. The guidelines also allow for designs encouraging footpath users to enter cycling paths to manoeuvre away from oncoming cyclists or pedestrians in cases where footpaths and cycling paths are next to each other, including in the case of wheelchair users. Running, walking and wheelchair use are among the most popular and lowest barrier to entry sports for people with disabilities.

2023-07-06-T-013,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The Member for Aljunied GRC, Mr Leon Perera, also spoke earlier about lesser-known or less popular sports, and I note that this issue is even more pertinent for PWDs' participation in less popular sports. Many of us in this House lauded the achievements and success of our paralympians and, in particular, our para-equestrian athletes, such as Laurentia Tan, who was the first Asian woman to win a Paralympic medal in equestrian sport in Beijing 2008. It is of note that para-equestrian events have their roots in therapy riding. And equine-assisted therapy is widely known to have myriad benefits, ranging from benefiting mental health and well-being, to therapeutic horseback riding, all of which work to build core muscles, balance, confidence, sensory motor skills and are also extremely calming and relational. And these benefits accrue, too, to typical and non-disabled individuals.",24,817,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00817

And I fear that the closure of the Singapore Turf Club, along with the expiry of leases to stables like the Bukit Timah Saddle Club to make way for residential or transport infrastructure, will only make these sports even more expensive and inaccessible to Singaporeans who could benefit tremendously, particularly as some retired race horses do eventually end up working as therapy horses or for other equestrian-related sports at our dwindling number of saddle clubs.",26,819,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00819

For example, individuals with sensory sensitivities or on the autism spectrum may find taking part in organised sports difficult to cope with because of the sensory input or unmet expectations, and I hope that parents and officials are given the right awareness and tools to know how best to cope with unexpected situations that arise. This could take the form of training officials and coaches to communicate more effectively with these individuals, to better awareness for parents about which sports may suit their child's specific needs. I also note that exhibits at places like KidsSTOP at the Science Centre have labels that stipulate sensory levels for various exhibits to aid parents to know whether the exhibit is suitable for their child, and perhaps the same system can be applied in the sporting context.",29,822,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00822

And I understand that the Government has been playing a very active role, too, alongside the athletes, the NSA and civil society.",17,878,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00878
2023-07-06-T-013,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),Our tchoukball players use the gym at the NYSI and the strength and conditioning specialists there have created a programme to help the team. SportSG has also provided sport psychology resources to help the teams in their mental preparation for tournaments and I am told this is making a big difference.,18,879,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00879

It is also looking to put Singapore on the regional and world maps for tchoukball. So, they are also looking to host regional and world tournaments and I understand SportSG has provided key support for these aspirations. In fact, in the next two weeks, the Association will be hosting the World Youth Championship 2023 and the South East Asia Tchoukball Championship 2023. These will be held at the ActiveSG Pasir Ris Sport Centre and I understand that SportSG has provided this venue free of charge.

2023-07-06-T-013,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Madam, let me conclude. I believe sports are a mirror that reflects the heart and soul of our nation and our society. This means that success and our broader goals as a nation with regard to sports must be about how we support every sport and every sportsperson, every athlete, at every step of the journey, whether the sport or sportsperson is emerging, reaching a peak, staying at the peak or, indeed, going through the important and necessary valleys and downslopes en route to the peaks. It is about how we show up throughout the journey.",20,881,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00881
2023-07-06-T-013,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"It is also, fundamentally, about coming together – athletes, sports entities, individuals and corporate supporters, civic society, alongside the Government, forging a compact. Inevitably, the Government will be the biggest animal in the jungle. But precisely because of this, it behoves the Government to exercise wisdom while playing an active role in the ecosystem, always looking to get things done through partnerships, indeed, enabling, empowering and strengthening various partners and stakeholders in the ecosystem and finding different ways to go far together in different sports, including in emerging and niche sports. And I have to stress this  the basic orientation for us has to be to go far together, rather than to go fast on any of our own. We play the long game; we take the long view.",21,882,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00882
2023-07-06-T-013,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And the final point, Madam, because sports are a mirror that reflects the heart and soul of our nation and our society, fundamentally, sports should unite, not divide. Sports must unite. Therefore, we do not need to exaggerate differences when there are few and we should celebrate common ground where there is plenty of such.",22,883,2023-07-06-T-013-S-00883

He said that team sports take time. As a national sportsman and a coach, he would be much more familiar with individual sporting challenges. But I cannot help but wonder if he would be as comfortable if those under his charge not only failed to perform after receiving significant financial support but actually regressed in terms of their sporting performance.",15,1055,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01055

To reiterate, I am, indeed, aware that we were ranked sixth in the recent SEA Games, but this is because medal types are counted differently and having secured 51 golds to Malaysia's 34, we ranked one above the latter, but they had 175 medals to our 157.

Ms Poh cited the example of table tennis – one of the sports where Singapore has indeed done relatively well – to argue that private sector efforts are just as important as a complement to the public sector. Mr Melvin Yong expounded on the range of sporting activities for the youths, especially the Pesta Sukan, where fresh talent may be identified and participation is encouraged. Mr Gerald Giam, in contrast, suggested expanding the Singapore Sports School which, in turn, would feed into a collegiate sports career. He also stressed the importance of flexibility for student athletes – a theme that was also made by Mr Leong Mun Wai who spoke about how our young men serve their NS obligations could stand to be relaxed for our top-tier sporting talent.",3,1061,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01061

And of course, these goals should eventually be established in consultation with all the stakeholders involved – the athletes and coaches, the NSAs and, of course, Singapore sports fans at large. It is also unrealistic since we do not have a complete picture of aggregate financial resources that could be credibly committed to these goals.",10,1068,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01068
2023-07-06-T-015,,,"Still, it is fair to note, as I did in my opening speech, that we do not only appear to systematically under-invest in sport, but we also appear to underachieve relative to how much we put in. Hence, the issue is how much more effective can we be with the monies we devote currently already to sport?",11,1069,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01069
2023-07-06-T-015,,,"For football, our almost national sport, Mr Faisal Manap did point out that the medium-term goal of qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup by 2026 was not just aspirational, but potentially realisable. We could also chase the SEA Games football goal in a decade. These strike us as eminently reasonable, especially since Singapore had in 1974 won the Southeast Asian Peninsula Games – the predecessor to the SEA Games – and secured silver over multiple years in the SEA Games football tournaments between 1983 and 1989 while also taking a bronze as recently as 2013.",12,1070,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01070

2023-07-06-T-015,,,"Lesser-known sports can also contribute strongly to our national sporting goals. Some of these sports have been immensely successful and we can build off their current global rankings and set targets to raise them by a notch or two. At the very least, it seems appropriate, as Leon Perera has argued, to extend National Sports Association coverage to all sports, including dodgeball and powerlifting, just as they have belatedly done with tchoukball, which I note only occurred this year and does not appear to have been updated on the ActiveSG website, which was the source for our citation. And in any case, it occurred well after the men and women's teams had already found global success.",14,1072,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01072

2023-07-06-T-015,,,"I agree, but I would go further. Perhaps we should look to such programmes as only necessary up till through to the medium run and we will hopefully wind these down in the long run, looking instead to a growing local sporting audience to ensure a self-sustaining domestic market for professional athletes to function – much like many other nations, without government grants, relying instead on recognition and sponsorship.",16,1074,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01074

While we accept that the Government has intimated that they have performed a number of reviews and continue to monitor performance, we have not seen the concrete fruits of such thorough evaluations for the sporting ecosystem as a whole. So, unless the Government will commit to a future date where they will release a report or review documenting this effort – I understand that the report for football will be coming soon, but not for the system as a whole – we will be unable to support this particular amendment.",20,1078,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01078

This wiggles, in our view, out of one of the most important fundamentals for sporting performance – appropriately defining success. It is important to have clarity on what our goals are and ideally set up, not only eventual, but also intermediate targets, that we can credibly achieve. Accepting the amendment also robs us of being able to meet the sort of mass participation goals that we alluded to that are imminently achievable.",21,1079,2023-07-06-T-015-S-01079

The National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) reveals that exercise and sporting activities reach an all-time high in 2022.

Perhaps, it was a reminder of our mortality and what we need to do to ensure that we remain fit and healthy. Or perhaps, it allowed us to reflect on the true value of sports in Singapore.

He introduced the Net Investment Returns, or NIR, framework which provided additional resources for Government spending to benefit Singaporeans, while balancing today's needs and savings for the future needs of generations to come.

2023-07-06-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Three, on the need to make an apology, the answer is yes and the reason is this. The Parliamentary Privileges, the conduct of Parliament, are important things. They underpin our democracy. Why do we have the rules in the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act? Why do we say that you should not falsely represent proceedings in Parliament? Why do we say that you should not mislead the public about what happened in Parliament? Why do we say that you should not misrepresent or falsely defame the Speaker or another Member of Parliament? Why do you think those rules are there?",4,1202,2023-07-06-T-017-S-01202

2023-07-06-T-019,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The time taken for a vacated rental flat to be tenanted again varies, starting from two months. It depends on the extent of sprucing up works required, the demand for rental flats in that location and whether it has been set aside for tenants affected by redevelopment of existing rental blocks. Flats set aside for tenants affected by redevelopment will be vacant for a longer period, as HDB sets aside these flats in advance so that affected tenants can move in once they are ready.",2,1210,2023-07-06-T-019-S-01210

2023-07-06-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"I take Ms Mariam and Mr Gan’s interest to be in Single Family Offices (SFOs) rather than Multi Family Offices. As previously explained in this House1, SFOs are set up by individual investors to manage the assets of their own families and are not required to be licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as they do not manage third party assets. MAS, therefore, does not have data on all SFOs. However, MAS has better data on SFOs that have applied for and been awarded the section 13O and 13U tax incentives.",2,1216,2023-07-06-T-021-S-01216

As at June 2022, SFOs that have applied for and been awarded the tax incentives employ about 1,400 Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs). About 900 of these jobs were created in just the last three years. These are generally well-paying jobs. Two-thirds of the Singaporeans and PRs employed by SFOs under the sections 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes earned more than S$5,000 per month. More than 400 earned between S$2,000 and S$5,000 per month, and fewer than 50 earned less than S$2,000 per month.",7,1221,2023-07-06-T-021-S-01221

I should first clarify that the sections 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes do not accord PR or citizenship status to the foreign owners setting up SFOs here. The conditions that award recipients are subject to do not differ by the residency status of the SFO owners. Accordingly, MAS does not collect such data. What MAS will do is to continue to review the sections 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes for SFOs to ensure they continue to make meaningful contributions to Singapore.",9,1223,2023-07-06-T-021-S-01223

The programme accords PR status to eligible global investors who intend to drive their businesses and investment growth from Singapore. Since 2020, a small number of about 30 SFO owners have been supported under the GIP based on their investment track record, investment mandate in Singapore, as well as the projected size and experience of their Singapore team.
