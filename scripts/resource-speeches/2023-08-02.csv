2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,Thank you. We had on 5 July 2023 responded to the Member’s Adjournment Motion on the issue of transportation of workers on lorries and covered some of the points that he raised in the two Parliamentary Questions.,1,96,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00096
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As stated in our previous response, the Government shares the objective of enhancing safety for every worker, regardless of nationality. We have worked closely with stakeholders and introduced a suite of additional safety measures.",2,97,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00097
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For example, we have mandated that the front passenger cabin be fully occupied before the rear deck can be used to carry workers, required lorries transporting workers to be fitted with canopies and higher side railings, raised requirements for S Pass and Work Permit holders to obtain a Singapore Class 3 licence that will allow them to drive light goods vehicles and imposed higher penalties for non-compliance.",3,98,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00098
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These measures have helped to enhance safety and reduce the risk for workers. The average number of fatalities from road traffic accidents involving persons onboard lorries has halved, from around six per year from 2013 to 2017, to around three per year from 2018 to 2022. The average number of injured persons on board lorries has also gone down by about a third.",4,99,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00099
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Our efforts will focus on improving safety for all road users. We will also continue to roll out measures that address a multitude of factors behind accidents, such as driving behaviours and vehicle speed.",5,100,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00100
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Government recognises that it is not ideal for workers to be transported on lorries, but we also understand the genuine concerns from employers. In a joint statement issued yesterday by more than 20 industry associations, including the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL), Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI), Association of Process Industry (ASPRI) and the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF), the employers stated that if the Government imposes a ban, many companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, will not be able to continue operating their business.",6,101,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00101
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"If the companies close down, there will be knock-on effects on society, including delays affecting new housing projects, polyclinics and MRT lines, as well as higher costs all around for Singaporeans.

My Ministry has been working closely with relevant Government agencies, including the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Ministry of National Development (MND), the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Traffic Police, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and Enterprise Singapore, as well as industry associations to progressively implement a suite of additional measures to improve safety for our workers.",8,103,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00103
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For instance, we introduced minimum rest time requirements for dual-role drivers and we announced plans to require all lorries to be fitted with speed management devices, details of which will be announced by MHA later this year. The Traffic Police will also continue enforcement to ensure compliance with existing traffic regulations.",9,104,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00104

2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"On the Member’s other question, section 126 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which regulates the carriage of persons in goods vehicles, is a legacy provision. It has been in the Act since it was first passed in 1961. From legislative records, it is also found in the predecessor to the Act, the Road Traffic Ordinance, dating back to before 1950. We do not have records to definitively confirm what was the rationale back then.",11,106,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00106

2023-08-02-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand the reply is no, but could I take one step back and ask whether MOT will consider, at least, setting up a new work group comprising companies, including the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with the point of discussing whether we should have this timeline towards a ban on the transportation of workers? I should add that the Senior Minister of State had shared the steps. But just a week after my Adjournment Motion, there were another two accidents involving lorries carrying these workers and another 37 workers were injured.",2,110,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00110
2023-08-02-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"And as President Halimah has said in this House 14 years ago, when she was a Member of Parliament here  ""We are talking about the lives and limbs of workers"". Fourteen years later, we are still discussing how to resolve this problem. Deputy Speaker Christopher De Souza had then, 14 years ago, also asked whether we would legislate to mandate that employers transport workers on buses. So, I really hope that we can have a greater sense of urgency; not an immediate ban but bearing in mind that we have talked about this for 14 years now.",3,111,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00111
2023-08-02-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second clarification is whether MOT can consider providing some funding or subsidies towards this transition towards safer modes of transport. I understand the constraints that SMEs face and I think the Government can provide a helping hand to them and also help the workers at the same time.,4,112,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00112

First, let me say that his two supplementary questions were also covered in my reply to his Adjournment Motion last month. But let me also reiterate that we have said that it is not ideal to transport workers on lorries.

Therefore, the way forward is for us to continue to work closely together in order to look at practical solutions. Solutions which are implementable, workable at the ground, and in the best interests of the workers to protect their safety as well as their livelihoods. And as I have said, we have been doing this. We have also recently introduced a slate of measures.",4,116,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00116
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The statistics itself show that there has been impact and there has been improvement in terms of the number of injuries and fatalities of workers being transported on board lorries. In fact, we have also said in our statement that was also issued by the various agencies, that over the past five years, for instance, to put in context, the proportion of persons on board lorries who have suffered injuries from traffic accidents, on average, is about 4%.",5,117,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00117

We will continue to work. This is really a work-in-progress. It will remain our priority – the safety of all road users, including workers who are transported on lorries – and we will have to work closely with the industry to see how we can address some of these challenges and issues, encourage more to transit and also, at the same time, look at other measures that we can put in place, where feasible and effective, to enhance safety for the workers.",6,118,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00118
2023-08-02-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the Member's question about timeline, I think I have already answered that before.

2023-08-02-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I have one suggestion. Perhaps, the Ministry can consider, first, prohibiting as an interim measure – prohibiting equipment, especially heavy equipment, and passengers on board the lorries at the same time because this causes a higher risk of injuries and fatalities in the event of an accident. It is something worth the Ministry to consider as an interim measure to avoid serious injuries or even fatalities.",3,123,2023-08-02-T-008-S-00123

I would say that this applies not only to submarines or, indeed, not only to naval assets, but to all our military assets.",1,137,2023-08-02-T-009-S-00137
2023-08-02-T-009,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"As the Member would know, over the years, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) have worked tirelessly to continuously improve on the use of technology and different processes in the design of our equipment and in the improvements in the midlife upgrades of our equipment so that we can actually achieve more fighting power with less manpower being used to drive it.",2,138,2023-08-02-T-009-S-00138
2023-08-02-T-009,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"So, this is something that you can actually see progressively across all classes of our assets, whether they be land, air or sea. This would also apply to our naval assets and, indeed, also in the design of our submarines. So, I just wanted to give the Member and all Members of this House this assurance that MINDEF and SAF are acutely aware of this manpower constraint and this is one of the top priorities as we make best use of this manpower and, at the same time, design, buy and equip our forces with equipment and assets that will serve our operational purpose.",3,139,2023-08-02-T-009-S-00139
2023-08-02-T-009,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"The second question is with regard to how the SAF – not only the Navy but across our different forces – will be able to interoperate with regional navies in order to better protect our interests. Here, I would like to point to the many exercises that the SAF – across land, sea and air – has been conducting with our neighbours and, indeed, friendly forces further afield all these years. And the very purpose of having these exercises is, indeed, to better understand one another's operating procedures and also to learn from one another. And the overall objective is to build friendly relations, better understanding and, at the same time, to be able to hone our ability to be effective in our operations.",4,140,2023-08-02-T-009-S-00140

In this scam variant, victims would come across advertisements for concert tickets on e-commerce websites or social media platforms, such as Carousell, Facebook, Telegram and Twitter. When victims approach the scammers to purchase the concert tickets, scammers would often claim that the tickets are selling fast to pressure victims into making payment quickly.",1,143,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00143
2023-08-02-T-010,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Once the payment is received, scammers would claim to be unable to transfer the tickets to the victim and, thereafter, become uncontactable. In some cases, victims may receive their tickets via email or WhatsApp, only to realise that the tickets are invalid on the actual day of the concert.",2,144,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00144
2023-08-02-T-010,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"To combat this scam variant and scams in general, no single measure alone is adequate. Instead, we require a multifaceted approach, including blocking scam content, enhancing the safeguards on digital platforms and public education. The SPF worked closely with social media and e-commerce platforms to take down scam advertisements for concert tickets, as well as accounts involved in such scams, as soon as they were detected. The SPF also worked with the platforms to prevent such scams from happening, such as through pre-emptive detection and blocking of scam accounts.",3,145,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00145
2023-08-02-T-010,,,"To raise awareness of concert ticket scams, SPF partnered ticket retailers, concert organisers and online platforms to issue advisories to the public. For example, SingPost displayed these advisories on digital screens within their outlets for members of the public who were queuing to purchase concert tickets. Ticketmaster placed similar advisories on their website.",1,146,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00146

The TSR informs consumers on the anti-scam measures that major e-commerce marketplaces have in place, such as user verification and secure payment options. We encourage consumers to transact only with the marketplaces with better ratings. For example, Facebook Marketplace is rated the worst in the TSR. They have not implemented the safeguards we recommended, despite repeated engagements with them. Shopee and Carousell, on the other hand, have stepped up their measures and we are glad also for the sake of their customers.",2,147,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00147

2023-08-02-T-010,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. Because of acts like Taylor Swift, Singapore is fast becoming an international hub or at least a regional hub for entertainment. It is important that we safeguard the factor of trust, Singapore as a place for such entertainment.",1,154,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00154
2023-08-02-T-010,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"So, in this sense, to this extent, how can the concert operators and concert promoters do more to safeguard, especially in the transfer of tickets and verification of authenticity, including to a certain extent, non-transferability of certain tickets, so that it is tagged to a particular person, making it, of course, harder to resell? I know that it affects business. But if you want to grow this as a hub, I think it is worthwhile considering. Will the Ministry consider that? The second, could the Minister of State share the estimated total amount lost due to such scam concert tickets over the last five years?",2,155,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00155

Indeed, today, we are seeing many popular performers, such as Taylor Swift and Coldplay. They have chosen to perform in Singapore after the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions and we realised that the scammers took advantage of these ticket sales to these concerts to perpetrate scams. As such, as I have shared, we continue to work and take the multifaceted approach where we work with the platform operators as well as the organisers of concert. In this case, not only to make sure that we, as far as possible, close the gap, at the same time, would also go upstream and share with the public on what they should look out for and always go to the authorised ticket sellers, even the resellers. This is an ongoing process. We will continue to work with them closely and see how we can improve the protection.",1,156,2023-08-02-T-010-S-00156

If Mr Yip is satisfied with the response, he may wish to withdraw his question after this session.",1,163,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00163
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked about the components of the net loss, including from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s currency intervention. MAS had explained in detail the constituents of its reported financial loss at its annual press conference in July, which I will reiterate here.",2,164,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00164
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"About 70% of the net loss was due to the negative currency translation effects of a stronger Singapore dollar. This is not due to currency intervention. The negative currency translation effects arise because the Official Foreign Reserves or OFR are held in foreign currencies but reported in Singapore dollars. Therefore, a stronger Singapore dollar will result in a lower value for the OFR when expressed in Singapore dollar terms. This currency translation effect does not have any bearing on the external purchasing power of the OFR or on MAS' ability to conduct monetary policy.",3,165,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00165
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,The remaining 30% of the net loss was due to net interest expenses from MAS' money market operations to mop up excess liquidity in the banking system. The net interest expense incurred on MAS' money market operations to mop up this excess liquidity in the banking system was unusually large in the last FY due to two factors  the large volume of operations and higher interest rates.,4,166,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00166
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The high volume of money market operations was necessitated by MAS' interventions in the foreign exchange market to moderate the appreciation of the Singapore dollar. As MAS explained earlier, had it not done this, the Singapore dollar would have been too strong and, therefore, hurt the economy. While this currency intervention added substantially to our OFR, it created excess Singapore dollar liquidity in our domestic banking system which MAS had to remove and, therefore, incur an interest expense in the process.",5,167,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00167
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Mr Don Wee asked if MAS plans to increase the interest yields and payments of Treasury Bills and bonds to curb losses and encourage a higher level of savings. Such instruments are issued by the Government and not by MAS. The interest rates payable on such instruments are not determined by MAS but are market-determined via auctions. As the interest rates of such instruments have increased in tandem with the rise in global interest rates, we have already seen a healthy pick-up in demand by the public.",6,168,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00168
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether there are plans to broaden the basket of currencies in which the OFR is held. The OFR is already held in a diverse range of currencies. As long as the Singapore dollar appreciates against these currencies, there will be negative currency translation effects. In the last Financial Year (FY), the Singapore dollar appreciated against every major currency. As MAS explained earlier, the effects of a stronger Singapore dollar cannot be hedged or diversified away.",7,169,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00169
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,Let me now respond to the Members' broader questions on monetary policy.,8,170,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00170
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Ms Hazel Poa asked about the benefits of a stronger Singapore dollar in view of the financial losses recorded by MAS. The appreciation of the Singapore dollar last year reflected the outcome of MAS' tighter monetary policy to dampen inflation. This policy has been successful in curbing imported inflationary pressures. Let me explain how. Between May 2022 and June 2023, Singapore's import price index had fallen by some 14%. This decline in import prices has, in turn, contributed to lower domestic inflation. On a month-on-month seasonally adjusted annualised basis, MAS' Core Inflation fell from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.2% in June 2023.",9,171,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00171
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how MAS strikes a balance between managing inflation and incurring losses and whether these losses are anticipated. MAS' monetary policy is focused purely on keeping inflation low and ensuring medium-term price stability. It does not take into account any potential impact on MAS' profits because to do so would undermine its mission. This is similar to how other major central banks conduct monetary policy. Many of them have also reported losses arising from their monetary policy operations. MAS' financial performance is a necessary consequence of its conduct of monetary policy.,10,172,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00172
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"The OFR is key in enabling MAS to conduct effective monetary policy. As a central bank, MAS adopts a conservative approach in its investments, with a significant proportion of its portfolio invested in liquid financial market instruments. Through a well-diversified portfolio and careful risk management, MAS expects to earn good long-term returns that are commensurate with its risk profile.",11,173,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00173
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Finally, let me turn to Mr Yip's question about the impact of MAS' net loss on the Government's budget position. MAS contributes to the Government's budget in two ways.",12,174,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00174
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"First, under the Net Investment Returns or NIR framework, the Government can spend up to 50% of the expected long-term real return on the assets invested by MAS, GIC and Temasek. NIR is based on the long-term expected returns of these entities and, hence, is not affected by their short-term performance. Accordingly, MAS' reported net loss in the last FY has no impact on the NIR that is available to the Government.",13,175,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00175
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Second, similar to other Statutory Boards, MAS makes contributions to the Government's Consolidated Fund in lieu of corporate income tax. This is based on 17% of the net profit for the year, after offsetting cumulative losses from previous financial years. The Government recognises that MAS contributions will vary considerably from year to year and has, therefore, smoothened the revenue volatility by requiring the annual contributions made by MAS to be paid in equal proportions over a period of three years.",14,176,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00176
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Given the net loss in FY22/23, MAS will not accrue a contribution to the Government's Consolidated Fund for that financial year. Nonetheless, MAS will still make a contribution of S$0.4 billion to the Government's Consolidated Fund in the current financial year, based on past profits. This smoothening formula has thus helped to mitigate the impact of MAS' net loss on the Government's budget.",15,177,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00177
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"In sum, MAS’ overarching mandate is to ensure macro-economic stability. As Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong stated in this House on 1 August 2022, the Government does not expect MAS to deviate from its mandate to maximise its contributions to the Budget. MAS’ monetary policy has helped to deliver broad macroeconomic stability for over 40 years, as the basis for sustained economic growth and increases in real incomes for Singaporeans.",16,178,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00178

2023-08-02-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I have a supplementary question, which is that, the Minister of State has said that the benefit of the strong dollar policy is to dampen inflation. Given that domestic consumption is $192 billion and this recorded loss of $30.8 billion is a big sum of money, equivalent to about 16% of domestic consumption, how much has it dampened inflation and compared to the $30.8 billion, what is the official cost-benefit analysis and the assessment on the efficacy of this policy?",1,180,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00180
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank the Member for her supplementary question. As I mentioned earlier in my reply, the loss is attributed to 70% to net currency translation losses and a 30% to interventions and money market operations. These are the normal functionings of how central banks conduct monetary policy and with its goal to dampen inflation and to have medium-term price stability – so that is to put that into context.",1,181,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00181
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On its impact on price stability and its impact on inflation, I had mentioned that in my parliamentary question reply. But let me also explain that if MAS had not tightened monetary policy, quarterly core inflation would have reached 7.2% year-on-year at its peak – 1.9 percentage points higher than the actual peak of 5.4% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2023. So, inflation would have stayed higher for much longer and brought about much more significant increases in the cost of living for households.",2,182,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00182
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Therefore, MAS' conduct of monetary policy has made an impact. We are still seeing the impact over the course of the different quarters, having tightened monetary policy five times since October 2021.",3,183,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00183

2023-08-02-T-011,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Thank you, Speaker. One motivation behind my request for a breakdown in the numbers was because MAS had previously explained that it would strategically strengthen the Singapore dollar for the purposes of addressing imported inflation. This was a move that I supported and, in fact, Minister of State Tan has reiterated this MAS position that the Singapore dollar has, indeed, appreciated against every major currency.",1,185,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00185
2023-08-02-T-011,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"That said, based on my understanding of the data, between January and July 2023, the movements of the Singapore dollar were essentially the converse of the US dollar. In particular, when there is a strengthening of the US dollar, the Singapore dollar would weaken and when the US dollar weakened, the Singapore dollar would strengthen.",2,186,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00186
2023-08-02-T-011,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"In particular, for the US dollar two most recent peaks at the beginning of June and July, this broadly corresponded to troughs in the Singapore dollar-US dollar rates. This actually suggests to me that MAS was not really leaning that much against the wind; or if it did, it was not doing so with sufficient interventions that would have altered the overall US dollar trends.  And, therefore, attributing losses, the 30%, that the Minister of State Tan mentioned, to sufficient interventions does not strike me as credible.",3,187,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00187
2023-08-02-T-011,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"So, my follow-up question then is whether the MAS actually views this earlier strong dollar policy as successful and, if so, why in March it announced a decision to ease the Singapore dollar policy?",4,188,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00188
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank Assoc Prof for his supplementary question. I think it is really important to note that the Singapore dollar is trade-weighted against a basket of currencies, not just the US dollar. Therefore, you need to look at it as a whole basket of currencies. We look at it from very much over the long term.",1,189,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00189
2023-08-02-T-011,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"First, on currency translation effects, I have explained that technically. The second is on currency intervention and as well as money market operations. Because the Singapore dollar was already on an appreciating trend and in addition to high savings rates as well as large volume of capital inflows, MAS also intervened by selling Singapore dollars and, therefore, moderating the appreciation rate. Had it not done so, then you could worsen inflation.",2,190,2023-08-02-T-011-S-00190

Mr Ang Wei Neng, Ms Mariam Jafaar, Miss Cheryl Chan, Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Sharael Taha have asked about the recent revision to the ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) income benchmark, its impact on past and future ComCare applicants, and whether more assistance can be provided.

2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, ComCare SMTA provides temporary assistance to lower-income households that need financial support to meet basic living expenses. Last month, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) raised the SMTA per capita household income (PCHI) benchmark from $650 and below, to $800 and below.",2,217,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00217
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The PCHI benchmark is not a criterion that once met would automatically qualify a household for SMTA. Eligibility for SMTA is based on a holistic assessment by Social Service Offices (SSOs), taking into account factors such as household income, savings and availability of family support.",3,218,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00218
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Households with PCHI above the benchmark, therefore, may also qualify for SMTA if their basic living expenses exceed their income. This is why we emphasise that the income benchmark for ComCare SMTA is not a hard threshold to qualify for assistance. Such households would therefore not have been deprived of ComCare assistance if they sought help at an SSO. For example, one of our ComCare households was a single mother and child with PCHI above $650. The SSO provided them with around $100 per month in SMTA cash assistance, in addition to support for their medical bills, utility bills, and services and conservancy charges.",4,219,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00219
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Given that the income benchmark is not used to determine SMTA eligibility, we do not use it to project the number of future recipients or assistance amounts.",5,220,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00220
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The number of SMTA applicants rose from around 61,000 in 2019, to around 80,000 in 2020 and 82,000 in 2021 at the height of COVID-19, before dropping to around 75,000 in 2022. The number of SMTA applications from January to June this year is slightly lower than that during the same period last year.",6,221,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00221
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The most common reason for unsuccessful ComCare applications in the past three years is that applicants had sufficient income or financial support for their basic living expenses. Other reasons include clients withdrawing their applications to apply for other assistance schemes, such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant, and clients not submitting supporting documents for ComCare eligibility assessment despite repeated requests from the SSO.",7,222,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00222
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The revision in the PCHI benchmark is the latest in a number of enhancements that MSF has made to ComCare policies and processes in the past year. In August 2022, we increased the quantum of assistance for households on ComCare SMTA and Long-Term Assistance (LTA). This is to adjust for increases in the cost of living and projected inflation. These complement other Government measures which address cost of living concerns, such as the cost-of-living special payments under the Assurance Package in 2022 and 2023. We also made it easier to apply for ComCare by introducing an additional channel for online SMTA applications in May last year, besides applying in person at SSOs.",8,223,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00223

Our partners include members of our SG Cares Community Networks, other Government agencies, social service agencies, grassroots organisations and leaders, and volunteers.

2023-08-02-T-012,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Thank you, Speaker, and I thank the Minister, for the comprehensive reply. Can I ask three supplementary questions?",1,230,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00230
2023-08-02-T-012,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The first one is, we noted that 75,000 Singaporean households receive ComCare assistance in 2022. And of the 75,000, how many households have income that is less than $650 per capita, and how many are above?",2,231,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00231
2023-08-02-T-012,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The second supplementary question is, we are, of course, very glad that MSF has increased the PCHI benchmark. In April this year, I had suggested to incorporate an inflation component in determining the amount of assistance to be provided to the needy residents as well as the benchmark. So, would the Minister consider that component and so review it annually, and not two to three years at one go?",3,232,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00232
2023-08-02-T-012,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"And my last supplementary question is, as what the Minister has said, we need to have a whole-of-Government effort to help needy residents. So, I have two other supplementary questions similarly about the PCHI benchmark for CHAS as well as rental flats. Apparently, both would not be answered today, and does it mean that the Ministries are not really coordinating to this effort?",4,233,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00233
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On the first question, I do not have the data. If the Member is interested to know the numbers, please file a Parliamentary Question (PQ). The Member ask how many of the 75,000 were below PCHI or above PCHI and still receiving the income. I do not have such data because it was not asked.",1,234,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00234
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On the second question on inflation component. Was it incorporated? Yes, indeed it was. The changes that we made are to the income benchmark, and this is that one in two to three years, and that takes into account data from the Department of Statistics on basic living expenses, and of course, after consulting our professionals, the social service professionals on the ground. That is why it takes two to three years to get the income benchmark reviewed.",2,235,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00235
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But like I mentioned just now, this income benchmark is not the criterion. It is not a hard threshold. But it is also a way for families to know whether they should or can come for assistance, and then, the SSOs will make a holistic assessment to give or not to give them, or to point them to other forms of assistance.",3,236,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00236
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For the cash assistance itself, we do make reviews regularly, particularly when there are peculiar instances, like these last two years of increasing inflation. But we do take into account, first, the packages available from the Government, such as at Budget 2023 when Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced a set of additional one-off support measures to Singaporeans to address immediate cost of living, and this included the 2023 cost-of-living special payment of up to $400 in cash to provide for this relief.",4,237,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00237
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"And then on top of that, MSF also announced from 4 April to 30 September 2022, SSOs provided a minimum of six months of support. So, it was without them being reviewed. A minimum of three months of additional support to existing SMTA recipients who renewed their assistance and more cash assistance with more flexible guidelines to cope with the increase in basic living expenses. Thus, on the fly too, we do that, particularly for adjusting the amount, the quantum that we provide for each family.",5,238,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00238

2023-08-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"In particular, I just want to raise one supplementary question on two cases. First and foremost, if any help can be given, for example for seniors, whom we know while they have got family members and their support, well, deemed support, because we always feel that family should be the first line of support. But unfortunately, not everyone is blessed to have families who really want to support them. So, I think for this kind of seniors, because of their age as well, do we need them to go on that quarterly basis – every three months, to go for interviews to ask and repeat their cases and situation again. While I understand it is about public funds and it needs good governance, can we do more to help the seniors? That is the first question.",2,242,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00242
2023-08-02-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"The second group of individuals are those who while they may not be senior in age, but we believe they have some level of mental condition, and it is very unlikely that they will find long-term employment. Can more be done by the SSOs?",3,243,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00243
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Like I mentioned, when we shape up the financial assistance for all the archetypes, we take into consideration the available support already given to them.",1,244,2023-08-02-T-012-S-00244
2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"And two considerations we do not want to lose, particularly for the younger families, is agency.

2023-08-02-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would urge Members to not dismiss the importance of families and not make it, I would say, too easy because we do not want families to not come forward to support the seniors.

2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Broadly speaking, Temasek has outperformed these market indices over the long term.

2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As a bottom-up investor, Temasek invests directly in companies.

2023-08-02-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The first is with regards to the losses in my Parliamentary Question (PQ). I mentioned that the net value of the portfolio shrunk by $21 billion. I think the Senior Minister of State mentioned it somewhat just now, but can he reassure the House that Temasek's losses or gains in terms of threshold of returns historically, will there be ways where the Senior Minister of State can highlight that, given the worst-case scenario going forward, what thresholds should we be comfortable with in term of dollars in million or billion amounts every year?",2,269,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00269
2023-08-02-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question I have is, the Senior Minister of State mentioned just now that the focus on Asia is about two-thirds, if I am not mistaken. Can the Senior Minister of State share, given the investment climate, Temasek's assessment or MOF's assessment going forward? To what extent will be Temasek's investment domestically versus overseas going forward, given circumstances if things require domestic investments, that is, investments needed in Singapore?",3,270,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00270
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I think the portfolio and the investment decisions are what we will leave to the board and the management of Temasek to decide independently. As I mentioned in my reply, what the Government will do is to look at the overall portfolio returns for Temasek over the longer term.",1,271,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00271
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Mr Saktiandi also asked about whether there will be certain thresholds. Sir, I think we have to bear in mind that we should look at the returns over a longer time period and on a portfolio basis. I think the board will set certain benchmarks to measure the performance of management. As the Government, we will certainly hold Temasek accountable for the overall long-term returns.",2,272,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00272
2023-08-02-T-013,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Mariam Jaafar.,1,273,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00273
2023-08-02-T-013,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State. Can I just clarify if the unlisted investments here would be comparable to private equity investments, which I think have had long-term returns north of 12% to 15%? So, if you are saying 10% for Temasek, is this the right comparison?",1,274,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00274
2023-08-02-T-013,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"My second supplementary question is, could you also share the returns by geography, in particular, Singapore, China and then something that is more comparable to the MSCI?",2,275,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00275
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, unlisted assets cover a diverse range of asset classes. They include private equity, but they also include infrastructure and real estate.",1,276,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00276
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"I think Ms Mariam asked about the benchmarks and comparisons. I shared in my main reply, and let me just refer to that again, that if we look at the rate of return, the IRR, for Temasek's unlisted assets, these have registered an IRR of 14.4% in the past 20 years. If you look at it, the unlisted portfolio has also generated an IRR of over 10% per annum over the last decade.",2,277,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00277
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The comparisons are not one-to-one with some of the other fund managers that Ms Mariam may be referring to. I do not have the data in front of me right now, but as I had also explained, Temasek is not a portfolio fund manager.",3,278,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00278
2023-08-02-T-013,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.,1,279,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00279
2023-08-02-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Speaker. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State one clarification? I am confused because Temasek reported a loss of $7.3 billion and you said the portfolio shrunk by $21 billion. How do you reconcile the two figures? If the portfolio shrunk by $21 billion, then rightfully, that should be reported as a loss as well.",1,280,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00280
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think Temasek has explained its position clearly in its report. I refer the Member to those reports.",1,281,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00281

2023-08-02-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker, can I ask the Senior Minister of State again? Sorry, I did not get that explanation in Temasek's report. Can you please explain again?",1,283,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00283
2023-08-02-T-013,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I will invite Mr Leong to have a look at what Temasek has put out previously in its annual report. The numbers that he referred to, the numbers that he wanted to clarify, I believe these are already explained by Temasek in their annual report.",1,284,2023-08-02-T-013-S-00284
2023-08-02-T-014,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the recent report released by NTU on possible geothermal energy sources in Singapore (a) whether there are plans to extract geothermal energy in Sembawang and, if so, how will Sembawang residents and businesses near the vicinity of the geothermal source be affected; and (b) whether there are plans to explore other potential sites in Singapore such as Pulau Tekong.",1,285,2023-08-02-T-014-S-00285
2023-08-02-T-014,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, my response will address Ms Poh's question and will also address a question filed by Mr Sharael Taha due for the Sitting on or after 3 August on the same topic.",1,286,2023-08-02-T-014-S-00286
2023-08-02-T-014,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Singapore does not have sufficient near-surface underground heat resources such as underground hot water or steam to deploy conventional geothermal systems. However, with the newer developments in geothermal technology, there is potential to harness heat that is deep underground for power generation.",2,287,2023-08-02-T-014-S-00287
2023-08-02-T-014,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"This exploratory study that is led by researchers from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) found that in Admiralty, the heat at a depth of four to five kilometres could be sufficient for electricity generation. However, these new geothermal technologies that can harness heat at such great depths have yet to be commercially deployed.",3,288,2023-08-02-T-014-S-00288
2023-08-02-T-014,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"There are therefore no immediate plans for geothermal energy production in Singapore. To holistically assess Singapore's geothermal potential, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) will be launching a tender later this year to conduct a geophysical survey across Singapore. That survey will take a few years to complete. It will provide additional data to help in the assessment of geothermal energy as a potential source of renewable energy in Singapore.",4,289,2023-08-02-T-014-S-00289
2023-08-02-T-015,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) over the last five years, what is the number of Grassroots Organisations (GROs) that have engaged in the practice of transferring sums of money to personal bank accounts for official operational needs and their respective amounts transferred; (b) in the case of the two GROs uncovered during the AGO's test checks, who are the responsible persons who authorised such transfers; and (c) what forms of disciplinary actions are taken against the relevant authorised persons.",1,290,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00290
2023-08-02-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the Auditor-General's Report that found inappropriate money management practices for welfare assistance schemes and in particular, the use of personal bank accounts to disburse cash for welfare and voucher assistance (a) what are the lessons learnt by the entities involved; and (b) whether systems will be put in place by those entities to prevent such occurrences in the future.",1,291,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00291
2023-08-02-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the standard procedure to distribute monies to beneficiaries for programmes that are not yet covered by the Government's electronic voucher system; and (b) how will the People's Association ensure that this procedure will be adhered to.",1,292,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00292

2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Grassroots Organisations (GROs) have always played an important role in enabling the Government's efforts to support residents by raising awareness of and, in some cases, directly administering national schemes, such as the Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers Scheme, on the ground.",3,298,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00298
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Each year, GROs help to administer about three to four national schemes across all constituencies. Many GROs would be activated to support the administration of these schemes, which typically involves processing at least 260,000 such applications each year.",4,299,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00299
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over the years, GROs have also initiated their own local welfare assistance schemes to provide assistance to their residents having regard to the specific needs of their local demographic, which these GROs assess. These local schemes complement the national schemes, often helping those who fall through the cracks. In total, these local schemes benefit at least 400,000 residents annually across Singapore.",5,300,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00300
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The assistance and support from the Government, GROs and community partners have had a real impact on the livelihood of our population. For instance, the cash distributions initiated by GROs and community partners help low-income households alleviate the increased expenses during festive seasons as they prepare for celebrations with their families.",6,301,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00301
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Heartland hawkers and merchants were able to obtain relief from the pandemic and rising costs of living with the CDC Vouchers Scheme. They could not have done so without the prompt reimbursement of the voucher claims facilitated by the GROs.,7,302,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00302
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, there are about 2,000 GROs across Singapore assisting to operationalise both national and local schemes that I have outlined. They do so by raising awareness and identifying eligible households and assessing applications, including from those who might marginally miss the criteria of these schemes or require some form of additional assistance.",8,303,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00303
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"People's Association (PA) staff and volunteers are then mobilised to extend the last-mile support under these schemes by directly administering the distribution of welfare assistance or vouchers from the Government or community partners. In doing so, PA staff and volunteers have developed a good understanding of the ground needs and often had to be flexible as well to render timely assistance to the residents.",9,304,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00304
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the proportion of GROs that were audited by the AGO. As I said, there are about 2,000 GROs across Singapore. Each year, the AGO decides on which organisation it wishes to audit – this includes the GROs – and how many it wishes to audit. The AGO also retains discretion to determine the areas to be covered in its audit and the approach to take.",10,305,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00305
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For the FY2022/2023 audit of PA, the AGO chose to audit welfare assistance schemes for the period of 1 April 2019 to 31 May 2022, a large part of which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. In its audit, two GROs were identified to have adopted inappropriate practices in the management of monies. I will explain to Members now the facts of these two cases.",11,306,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00306
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The first case concerned the management of monies for welfare distribution at festive events by one GRO.,12,307,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00307
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Welfare distributions to low-income residents at festive events are a form of local welfare assistance scheme initiated by the GROs, often in collaboration with community partners. This, as I said, complements the national schemes in rendering support to the vulnerable. Such schemes are not uncommon and most GROs would have their local schemes to address the specific local needs of each constituency.",13,308,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00308
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In auditing the disbursement procedure of this scheme, the AGO found that a crossed cheque was issued to a staff member. When the cheque was brought to the bank by the staff member, it would be processed, and the amount would be deposited into the staff member's bank account. The staff member would then withdraw the deposited amount in cash over the bank counter, accompanied by one other staff member. Verification of the cash withdrawn would be performed by a third staff member not involved in the cash withdrawal.",14,309,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00309
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Throughout this process, the deposit and withdrawal would be tagged to the individual responsible in PA's Financial Accounting System that is used by all GROs to account for receipts and payments. The monies withdrawn were then distributed to the scheme recipients, with proper record and accounting of the amounts given out.",15,310,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00310
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked what the standard procedure would otherwise have been. Sir, the standard procedure would have been to do all of the above, except one step, which is for the cheque to be an uncrossed one, made out to the staff member, with the words ""or bearer"" crossed out. When the uncrossed cheque is brought to the bank, the cash would be withdrawn immediately over the counter and retained by the staff concerned and then applied to the scheme for disbursement. That would have been the usual step.",16,311,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00311
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There are a few notable points from this case. First, whilst this was not the correct procedure, the staff concerned explained that it was thought that the additional step in using the crossed cheque was taken to better account for the money. And that was why that step was taken. Second, the monies withdrawn were duly checked and verified through the process by multiple and different staff members. Third, all the amounts deposited, withdrawn and distributed were properly recorded and accounted for. The AGO has reviewed the records and found no evidence of loss or misappropriation of monies in this case. The practice ceased once the AGO noted this observation in the course of its audit.",17,312,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00312
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The second case concerned the reimbursement of monies to the hawkers and merchants under the CDC Voucher scheme at one GRO. The CDC Voucher scheme was launched by the PA in 2020 to help lower-income households defray their cost of living and, at the same time, support hawkers and heartland merchants who were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, GROs helped to administer the scheme by distributing the physical vouchers to the low-income households, as well as thereafter, facilitating the reimbursement of voucher claims from the hawkers and merchants. The period in question coincided with the time when cashflow of hawkers and merchants were seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and various other measures, including safe management measures.",18,313,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00313
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The GRO in question thus saw a need to set up a system which could facilitate a prompt claims process for the hawkers and merchants under the scheme. For this case, the AGO found that the process took place as follows  staff collected the used physical vouchers from the hawkers and merchants and tabulated the amount to be reimbursed to each of them on a weekly basis. The transaction volume was high, with most of the claims of small amounts, at around $20 to $30. Members would recall that this first iteration of the CDC Voucher schemes was entirely physical; physical vouchers were used.",19,314,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00314
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To facilitate these reimbursements, a crossed cheque would be issued by the GRO to the relevant staff member's name, who would withdraw cash and then reimburse the hawkers and merchants using this cash withdrawn. When the hawkers and merchants received the monies from the staff, they would indicate their receipt of the cash by signing against the listings prepared by the staff member.",20,315,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00315
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Similar to the first case, the process deviated from the standard procedure in that a crossed cheque was issued instead of an uncrossed cheque and the monies went through the staff member's personal bank account briefly. This was not the correct procedure. However, there were proper records and accounting of all the claims and the disbursement of monies. The AGO has reviewed the records and found no evidence of loss or misappropriation of funds, as in the first case. This arrangement ceased with the changes to the CDC Voucher scheme in December 2021 when electronic vouchers were introduced in place of physical ones.",21,316,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00316

Thus far, we have identified three other cases in which similar inappropriate practice of money management for welfare assistance schemes was adopted. In all of these cases, there was also no loss of funds nor any mala fides in staff conduct. These practices have also since stopped.",22,317,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00317

2023-08-02-T-015,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Speaker. May I ask the Minister, with the move towards digital payments for disbursements to reduce cash handling, what would be the impact on the elderly who may not own or have use of mobile devices? Second question  are there simpler ways to allow the use of PA or grassroots bank accounts for fund disbursement purposes and disallow the use of PA staff personal bank accounts for such purposes?",1,334,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00334
2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Thank you, Ms Pereira. The first question is a valid one. As we move towards ensuring that we undertake transactions digitally, there will be a constituency of persons, usually the elderly, who are not able to keep up and process the transactions in the same way. So, what we do at PA is we always go with the mantra that we say it is digital first, but not digital only. So, those of our seniors or other residents who come and need assistance because they are unable to process or handle the transactions digitally, we will assist them in person and, in some cases, if necessary, we will help them to print the hard copies so that they will be able to administer.",1,335,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00335

2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To the Member's second question, the proper process, as Members have heard me outlined, is indeed to avoid co-mingling with the staff's bank account. In this case, what happened was that the cheque was crossed and, as a result, had to be deposited in the staff's account. The usual process is for the cheques to be uncrossed and for cash to be handled across the counter without entering the staff's bank account.",3,337,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00337

2023-08-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In relation to the Member's point about whether we will make the findings public and publish a report, I will have a word with the review committee. The scope of its work is essentially to look at its current processes, give a view and to really have a second pair of eyes. In most of these cases, it is not that the process is not set out. The process has been set out, there are standard operating procedures (SOPs), and in fact, that is why the AGO was able to audit it and make these findings of inconsistency relative to what the SOP ought to be. But I will convey the point and discuss it with the review committee.",2,343,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00343

The scope of the checks, as I said, would be similar to what the AGO has done in terms of timing as well as the scope – ""scope"" meaning the kind of transactions as well as having regard to the nature of the problems picked up. Obviously, as we do this, even as we focus on those transactions, the lessons learnt can be adopted on a broader scale, such as co-mingling is not just prohibited in the context of welfare assistance schemes, but also across the board. So, those are lessons that we will pick up from this review but applied across a broader variety of different transactions.",3,344,2023-08-02-T-015-S-00344

This remark was not fully audible on the normal livestream, save for a slight burble of sound at the end and, as far as I am aware, it was not audible to Members in the Chamber at the time the words were uttered. However, that burble of sound on the livestream was obviously noticed.

Mr Seymour petitioned the Speaker for a withdrawal of the remark and an apology.

One refers to the Police matters which are offences because the Police, obviously, investigates offences. I have not considered, but I am not entirely sure that making something louder is an offence. Because if the words were said, which I believe Mr Tan has admitted, the only difference is that on the livestream, it could not be heard. But if the words were actually said, and what the person has done is to make it louder, then you cannot deny that the words were said.

He offered to resign. I accepted but I told him that before he actually resigned, I had first to make sure residents in Kembangan-Chai Chee, his ward, and Marine Parade, his Group Representation Constituency (GRC) were taken care of. Meanwhile, his relationship with Miss Cheng had to stop. A few weeks ago, I came across information that strongly suggested that the affair had continued. I decided that Mr Tan had to go forthwith.

In such cases, what we do depends on many factors  the circumstances, how inappropriate or scandalous the behaviour was, the family situations. We also have to be conscious of the impact on innocent parties – particularly the spouses and children. I had explained this at my press conference on 20 July; so did Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong last week in a BBC interview.

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"The present situation falls into the third category. It is wrong. Mr Tan and Miss Cheng had to stop their affair. I told them to stop. In deciding what more should be done, consider this  would we object to having the Speaker being married to a Member of Parliament (MP)? Would we object to having the Speaker being married to an MP? I think the answer is no – that would be perfectly alright. There is no direct reporting line between the Speaker and an MP. Thus, an open, legitimate relationship between the Speaker and an MP is not in itself objectionable. Hence, this situation of the Speaker having an affair with an MP does not fall into the category where immediate action has to be taken.",15,419,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00419

An extramarital affair between him and an MP is therefore problematic. It puts other MPs and staff in an awkward position, and it is just not proper. After I spoke to Mr Tan in November 2020, he told me that the relationship would end. I took it to be so. I, therefore, felt there was some leeway to take some time to decide what further steps to take.",16,420,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00420

As to whether one or both should also resign as Members – I had not decided at that time, but quite likely both would have had to leave at some point. By giving the matter some time, I had hoped to give them a softer exit, and save them and their families the pain and embarrassment that they are suffering now.

Thus, to be fair to the persons involved, law enforcement agencies generally refrain from immediately naming the persons being investigated.",4,452,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00452
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"There are situations where agencies will depart from this norm and mention names. In Minister Iswaran’s case, given that it involved a Minister, CPIB decided to disclose on 12 July that Minister Iswaran was assisting CPIB with investigations into a case uncovered by CPIB. At that point, CPIB did not state that Minister Iswaran had been arrested, as it had wanted to first establish more facts of the case, including hearing his side of the story.",5,453,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00453
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"These are decisions for CPIB to make. What law enforcement agencies, including CPIB, reveal at any point in time takes into account their operational considerations in the cases they deal with – including preserving the integrity of evidence, protecting the confidentiality of ongoing investigations and avoiding impact on other related parties.",6,454,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00454
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"This is why the Prime Minister’s initial statement and Deputy Prime Minister’s doorstop interview on 12 July took reference from CPIB’s press release on the same day. This was the proper thing to do because Ministers, including the Prime Minister, should not reveal more than what the law enforcement agencies are prepared to disclose. While Ministers do have the final decision-making power, they will usually take the advice of the law enforcement agencies.",7,455,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00455
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Two days later, on 14 July, Hotel Properties Limited, or HPL, issued a statement saying that Mr Ong Beng Seng had been ""given a notice of arrest"" by CPIB. The media asked CPIB about this. By then, investigations had been ongoing for three days and CPIB had obtained more facts. CPIB made the operational judgement call that it would be appropriate at that point in time to confirm that both Mr Ong and Minister Iswaran had been arrested.",8,456,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00456

2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Singaporeans are understandably concerned about this matter. In due course, further details of the investigations will be made public. But I hope we can all recognise that we must give CPIB the time and space they need to do their work. This was a case that CPIB had uncovered by themselves. We can rely on CPIB to conduct its investigations thoroughly and independently, and to see this case to its logical conclusion – as it has with every other case it has investigated over 70 years.",10,458,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00458

2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),Mr Leong Mun Wai and Mr Louis Chua asked whether all CPIB investigations require the Prime Minister's concurrence and if CPIB is obliged to seek the Prime Minister's concurrence to open formal investigations of potential offences that CPIB has uncovered.,12,460,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00460

2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In this case, it kept the Prime Minister informed and sought his concurrence to initiate formal investigations of Minister Iswaran because the investigations concerned a Cabinet Minister.

2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),There is a crucial difference between that earlier CPIB investigation into Ministers Shanmugam and Vivian and CPIB's ongoing investigation involving Minister Iswaran.,21,469,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00469
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"For the Ridout bungalows matter, the two Ministers had asked the Prime Minister for an independent investigation into their rental of SLA Black and White bungalows and the Prime Minister had tasked CPIB to do the investigation. The Prime Minister had no reason to believe that the Ministers had committed any wrongdoing then and, therefore, saw no need to put them on leave of absence during the investigation.",22,470,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00470
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),The CPIB investigation subsequently cleared both Ministers.

2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"For the case involving Minister Iswaran, CPIB came across some information concerning him while investigating a separate matter. It then decided it should look further into the matter. In these circumstances, the Prime Minister's assessment was that it was necessary to suspend Minister Iswaran from his official duties while the investigation took place.",24,472,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00472
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),Mr Leong Mun Wai asked whether Minister Iswaran's gazetted leave of absence from his duties from 7 July to 9 July was related to the CPIB investigation.,25,473,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00473
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"For the record, Minister Iswaran took leave of absence from 7 July to 9 July for personal matters.

Misrepresentations had hitherto been made by various Government Ministers and possibly in this House even, before October 2020, and they stood uncorrected for months.

Can I invite the Prime Minister to reconsider his position in view of the PAP's pattern of behaviour in this term of Government, especially when a potentially embarrassing issue comes up? I would like to suggest to the Prime Minister, in view of the complexity of government and governance today, it would not be embarrassing for the Government to consider the appointment of an ethics advisor.",14,522,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00522
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, my clarifications on the former MP Cheng Li Hui and Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin matter are as follows  the Prime Minister said, in comparing the hot mic issue with the inappropriate relationship, I quote, ""in comparison, the relationship was the more serious matter as he was the Speaker and she was an MP and there should not be a relationship"".",15,523,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00523
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My question is if the Prime Minister knew of the affair in 2020, why were Speaker Tan and Cheng Li Hui allowed to be on the same Standing Select Committee of Parliament, namely the House Committee, after GE 2020, when the Prime Minister was already aware of the affair? Would not their being on the same Committee have resulted in more interactions between them than necessary or given official reasons to be together? To this end, has the Prime Minister checked, since he knew of the affair in 2020, how many foreign trips have both Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and Cheng Li Hui have been on – at the taxpayers' expense – and was he not aware of them?",16,524,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00524
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My next question  the Prime Minister stated at the press conference in response to a reporter's question that, I quote, ""as for comparison with Michael Palmer, I think it depends on the situation of the case and I said you've got to look at the circumstances, spouses, the family's condition and how you manage this as sensitively as you can and yet do your duty, and it depends on the person's response as well as the specifics, so I don't think it's possible to make direct comparisons"".",17,525,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00525
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I note the Prime Minister's reference to such sensitivity, an eminently reasonable approach to take with delicate matters. However, the PAP selectively applies these standards, expecting Singaporeans to give the PAP the full benefit of doubt when its MPs foul up, while screaming blue murder when the Opposition seek to make the same point.",18,526,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00526
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"When former MP Raeesah Khan revealed to the Workers' Party leaders that she was a rape victim, sensitivity was not even considered by the Committee of Privileges in accounting for the delay in addressing Raeesah's lies to Parliament. And the Prime Minister did not bat an eyelid in giving the Leader of the Opposition a sermon on Confucian ethics, morality and shame, even though at the material time, he would have been aware of the affair between Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and Member of Parliament Cheng Li Hui.",19,527,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00527
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Can the Prime Minister please elaborate how the Tan Chuan-Jin affair with a Member of Parliament was different from the circumstances and conditions of former PAP Speaker Michael Palmer's affair with a People's Association (PA) member, which Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean then had said, had to be dealt with, I quote, ""decisively"".",20,528,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00528
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, why was there a need for so much time to plan for the care of Marine Parade, and specifically Kembangan-Chai Chee residents? In other cases of resignations of PAP MPs, such as Michael Palmer, President Halimah, David Ong and Senior Minister Tharman, nothing close to that length of time was required. Could the Prime Minister detail for us what exact steps were taken between February and July 2023 to arrange for the care of Marine Parade residents? If that was the crux of the issue, then even if the planning for the care of Marine Parade residents was a proper justification for Tan Chuan-Jin to remain a Marine Parade Member of Parliament for five months, why was he not asked to step down as Speaker first and a new Speaker elected? If he had stepped down as Speaker, could he still not have continued as a Marine Parade MP until the arrangements were made?",21,529,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00529
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And before I round off, Mr Speaker, just one additional question. How were Tan Chuan-Jin and Cheng Li Hui counseled immediately after Prime Minister was informed about the affair in 2020? Did he personally counsel them and how often did he check in on the status of the relationship thereafter?",22,530,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00530

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me deal first with the question of transmission of information. The Leader of the Opposition raises three issues, one of which has been extensively debated, in fact in 2020, during COVID-19; and I do not need to go back there again, which is the TraceTogether and whether we should have announced earlier when we discovered that the Police were using it for their purposes. I think that has been completely explained, closed; that matter is done.",1,532,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00532
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"As for CPIB statements, the CPIB does not investigate somebody unless there is a very serious reason to do so.

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Therefore, in general, CPIB investigations are not in the first instance, announced at all. If you had listened to Minister Chan Chun Sing, you would have heard that explained very clearly why in general the CPIB does not announce any investigations at all. And when I asked the CPIB to investigate, it is my prerogative, I do not have to tell anybody. What is important is that I did conduct an investigation and these investigation results were published. That is what matters.",3,534,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00534
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"In the case of the 12 July statement, the reason why the CPIB said exactly what they said, if you listen carefully to Minister Chan Chun Sing, that explanation has been given – which was that they had to say what they felt justified in saying at that point for operational reasons and to be fair to the persons involved; and the Ministers, unless we have strong reason to do otherwise, we will go along and we will not go beyond what the CPIB needs and is able to say.",4,535,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00535
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"So, I think in terms of transmission of information, we are pursuing a red herring. We could equally well ask, for example, when did the Leader of Opposition know about problems in his party and what did he do about them? But those are matters which the Workers' Party will have to decide and will have to account to Singaporeans, and the PAP, we establish our own standards and we establish our own practices.",5,536,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00536

Working trips would be, for example, for the Olympic Games, and so on. Of the five official overseas trips, only one was where Miss Cheng Li Hui was present as well. That was the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) General Assembly trip to Cambodia in 2022. There were 15 MP delegates in total for this trip.",2,545,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00545

Of the 18 visits, Miss Cheng Li Hui only participated in one overseas trip and that is the AIPA General Assembly one held in Cambodia in 2022, but she did not attend more overseas trips than other MPs.

2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"First, on TraceTogether, that this has been extensively debated and so forth. Not particularly so. There are matters for which questions still arise. I think the Prime Minister made a Statement well after the TraceTogether issue was debated in Parliament, I think this was in March 2001, where he apologised and said, let me quote, I have to be very clear about this matter. This was in a Straits Times article on 14 March, well after we had discussed TraceTogether. The Prime Minister came out to say, ""I think we made a mistake. The app was made for contact tracing, but under the law, the Police have powers to ask for information for criminal investigations.

And I was not going to stand up and call her out and say, ""No, these are the reasons why that lie had to be said."" I think I made that apparent to the COP.",4,581,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00581

I think Minister Shanmugam had a discussion with the Mayor of New York, I believe, talking about privacy concerns, TraceTogether concerns, and my point is, did no one in the Government consider the applicability of section 20 to the CPC?

Mr Singh said that on 4 October when he met Ms Khan in the Leader of Opposition's (LO) office, she was in a dazed state, suggesting that she was somewhat disoriented. Ms Lim also gave the evidence that at the DP hearing on 29 November, Ms Khan explained that the anecdote was not in the first draft because she was disassociated and did not know what she was doing. Ms Lim also said that she was worried because as far as she and senior Workers' Party (WP) leaders could understand, Ms Khan was doing things without thinking.""",4,607,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00607

He is referring not to my words or my testimony in the Committee, but how the Committee of Privileges characterised in its report, its interpretation of what had happened vis-a-vis what Ms Khan had said. But would the COP not want to know all the facts of the matter? In fact, in the documents that I submitted to the COP, it was clearly stated in my notes that this is what Raeesah Khan told us. And so, I was merely relaying that to the Committee. To then – as he is doing now – make an inductive leap and characterise that this is now an attack on all people who are suffering from mental health issues and that we are going for the jugular here, I think that is really, really not proper.

2023-08-02-T-017,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, on the timeline of CPIB's disclosures, in hindsight, would it have been foreseeable that HPL would make a disclosure publicly that their Managing Director had been subject to a notice of arrest and asked to provide information on his interactions with Minister Iswaran?

I will answer on behalf of the Prime Minister as this relates to the CPIB technical issues, which I thought we will address in the second bucket of questions. The short answers to Dr Tan Wu Meng's questions are as follows  number one, would CPIB have revealed more information earlier than what it has done?

There is no requirement for subsequent approval.",2,643,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00643

2023-08-02-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. First is on the matter of principle in my Parliamentary Question (PQ). I asked about the transparent guidelines for mandatory disclosures or announcements when a Minister is personally implicated. I am concerned first as a matter of principle, because a political office holder is involved and also in the context and environment that we are possibly open to leaks and the social media age that we are in, what does that mean in that sort of context? Does it really mean that we actually have to have a different set of rules or transparent guidelines when a political office holder or Minister is involved?",1,645,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00645
2023-08-02-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second supplementary question, Speaker, is in regards to the Prime Minister's point just now about Mr Iswaran's interdiction from duty, and yet, the Prime Minister mentioned that he would still be getting $8,500 per month. Can the Prime Minister explain the reasoning behind the $8,500? In normal circumstances, we would expect someone with interdiction from duty and no role or duties that would be undertaken for the month, would be possibly taking an absence of leave from duty rather than possibly getting the $8,500? I hope the Prime Minister can help answer the question.",2,646,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00646
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, guidelines on disclosures involving Ministers, basically, we have to judge the situation. In this case, CPIB judged and I supported them, that they are going to be interviewing a Minister. They are going to be interviewing other people, word would go around town. It is untenable for us to say we have no comment. And therefore, they put out the statement that they are interviewing a Minister.",1,647,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00647
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"There have been, and it is not the previous precedent. Those of you who are old enough to remember, I do not think there is anybody else in the House except me who was here when Mr Teh Cheang Wan was investigated – none of that was announced. Because you do not know at first, when you interview him, whether or not there is something there. And if you interview him, if you announce that he is being interviewed, Minister for National Development, and then it turns out there is nothing there, and you come out three days later and say, ""the Minister for National Development is innocent"", I think you are going to cause great consternation and at the end of that, his reputation will be damaged undeservedly.",2,648,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00648
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"But if you investigate him first, if it turns out there is something there, at some point, you cross a threshold and it is necessary to make an announcement.",3,649,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00649
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"In this case, CPIB judged that the threshold to say that they are talking to Mr Iswaran was there right from the beginning, because they were going to call in other people, including Mr Ong Beng Seng, HPL; therefore, it was not possible for this thing to be kept quiet and it had to be stated up front.",4,650,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00650
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"But would they know where the investigation will lead? At that point, no.",5,651,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00651
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Three days later, after interviewing different people and establishing various facts, they make a fresh assessment, at that point, they are comfortable to say that the Minister was arrested and bailed.

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"So, these are operational judgements which our law enforcement agencies have got to make.

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"In this case, CPIB did it. Did they know that three days later, HPL would issue such a statement? I think they expected that HPL would have to issue such a statement because there is a regulatory requirement by the Singapore Exchange (SGX), I do not think they would know what Mr Ong Beng Seng would say and it would depend on what had transpired during the three days before Mr Ong put out that statement.",8,654,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00654
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"So, I think, we are reading a lot into very little. First of all, nobody knew that Mr Iswaran might or might not have been doing something wrong. CPIB found out. Nobody tipped them off. Nobody blew a whistle. Nobody raised a public scandal, no Parliamentary Questions in Parliament, not even from the Workers' Party. But CPIB found out and they told me, and they decided to investigate the matter. They proceeded. It reached the point where they needed to interview the Minister. And then, they came to tell me and say, ""Can I have your concurrence?"" Because CPIB reports to somebody. It has to report to somebody! It cannot report to God!",9,655,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00655
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"So, who does it report to? That is a very interesting question. Once upon a time, we had an SAF officer who went overseas on a course. He went to a Commonwealth country. And the course mate asked him  how do you keep your system clean, in Singapore, of corruption? This is a country which grapples with this problem. And he explained how we do it, we have the CPIB, it was zealous, it has a fearsome reputation, you go and ""lim kopi"", you know what will happen.",10,656,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00656
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"And his course mate asked him, ""Whom does the CPIB report to?"" So, he thought this was an organisational question. So, he said, ""Well, it is independent, it is got its own chain of command, it reports to the Prime Minister."" And his course mate looked at him again and says, ""Who does the CPIB report to?""",11,657,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00657
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Why did he ask that question? Because the question, at the root of it, is the age-old problem, who is to judge the people who judge the people who judge the judges? Who is in charge? Somebody has to be in charge. And in Singapore, the Prime Minister is in charge and if he is corrupt, you are sunk.",12,658,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00658
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"But beyond that, we decided to put in an extra safeguard – and that is if the Prime Minister directs the CPIB ""you do not do that"", CPIB can go to the President and say that ""Prime Minister has refused me consent, do you concur?"" And if the President says yes, then the Director of CPIB can proceed. If the President agrees with the Prime Minister that the Director of CPIB does not have a case or has gone rogue, or is doing something ill-founded and says no, well, that is how two keys work. And, therefore, the matter stops there.",13,659,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00659
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Is it guaranteed? No, because the Prime Minister may be corrupt, the President may be mistaken. But it is as best, it is possible to contrive a system with human beings, which will work, provided you put honest people in charge. That is how the system is supposed to work in Singapore.",14,660,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00660
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"As for the interdiction and why it is $8,500 per month, we considered this carefully. We are not the first. It is unusual for a Prime Minister to have to do this to a Minister, but we are not the first organisation to confront this problem of a person under suspicion being investigated. And what do you do with him while he is being investigated, before he is either cleared or charged and convicted?",15,661,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00661

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"In the case of the Ridout bungalows, I had no doubt I could leave the Ministers at work. I did not believe that they were guilty, neither did any evidence come up during the process of investigation that they were. In fact, the investigation cleared them. If the investigation had surfaced something which looked questionable, I would have been told and I would have made the decision on whether they needed to be interdicted and put on leave of absence.",17,663,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00663
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"In the case of Mr Iswaran, by the time formal investigations began on 11 July, the CPIB had been working on this case since at least May. So, they had some basis to come to some conclusion and I had to decide what to do with a Minister who is being investigated for what could be quite a serious matter, which is a possible corruption offence. That is why CPIB is investigating it.",18,664,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00664
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"And what do I do? Because I do not have a precedent, I do not have a norm, I look at what the Civil Service does as a guideline. Their situation is different.",19,665,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00665

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"So, I could technically have said, ""Well, presumed innocent and he goes on leave, full pay, until the matter is cleared.""

If, later on, in fact, you are found guilty, well, at that point, your pay will stop completely and other consequences will follow.",24,670,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00670

That was done when, eventually, he did resign, I think, on 17 July.",6,684,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00684

The Prime Minister mentioned that in the Civil Service, the practice is to put them on half pay. I can understand the rationale for that in the case of low-wage earners who may need a regular monthly income in order to survive. But I think that hardly applies in the case of a Minister. For $8,500 a month, that might be small change to some, but many Singaporeans have to work very hard for much less than that.",2,709,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00709
2023-08-02-T-017,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,"Secondly, about protection for civil servants. Although the Minister said that there is a non-retaliation clause, can the Minister elaborate on what that non-retaliation clause comprises or, if not, to let me know where I can find further information on that?",3,710,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00710
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, on the second question, I have explained the protection of the civil servants in terms of the non-retaliation laws, which basically say this  if anybody thinks that they have a case, they report it in good faith, and even if subsequently the so called ""accused"", or alleged accused is found to be innocent, there will be no retaliation against the person who made the initial report. That is the spirit of the non-retaliation law and it is in our Public Service rules.",1,711,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00711
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Ms Hany Soh. Oh, Prime Minister.",1,712,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00712
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Sorry, Mr Speaker, to respond to Ms Poa on why not no pay leave. It is my judgement to make. The Civil Service works in one way, their basis is if you have been convicted, then you are on zero pay and other consequences will follow. Here, I have to be fair to the Minister involved as well as do the right thing by the Government and the taxpayer. He is under investigation, it is not a minor matter. He has not been convicted. He has not even been charged. Is it fair for me to say, ""Your pay goes to zero""? I think it is not.",1,713,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00713
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"What is fair? Well, I looked at the Civil Service. The Civil Service says half pay, subject to a minimum and ceiling. Their ceiling is about here too. So, I decided on this number, $8,500, because much less than half pay. So, I think we have to go on principles, rather than whatever we do, anything you can do, I can do stronger. I think that would not be a wise approach to take.",2,714,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00714
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Hany Soh.,1,715,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00715
2023-08-02-T-017,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. This question is in relation to Minister Chan's earlier comment in relation to CPIB being functionally independent. My clarification is, what oversight is exercised over the CPIB and whether the CPIB's investigation methods are being audited on a regular basis to ensure impartiality and parity of treatments, regardless of the identity of the subject of their investigations?",1,716,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00716
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, on the second point on the quality of CPIB's investigations, all our law enforcement agencies learn from one another. They also learn from best practices from other parts of the world to make sure that our systems are up to mark. But the most significant test of whether our investigations are up to mark is really this – that when CPIB or any of our law enforcement agencies submit their case to the AGC and it goes to the Courts, are our investigation methods up to the mark? Because if they are not up to the mark, they will be rejected by the AGC and the Courts.",1,717,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00717
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, the final arbiter, if you like, of the quality of the work that our law enforcement agencies do is actually our Courts.",2,718,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00718
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Dennis Tan.,1,719,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00719
2023-08-02-T-017,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to seek some clarifications from the Prime Minister. Earlier, the Prime Minister said that sometime around after 29 May, the Prime Minister had informed someone in MTI. May I know what is the purpose of this communication, who in MTI was informed of this and what was the purpose of this communication, for example, whether any precautionary measures were carried out?",1,720,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00720
2023-08-02-T-017,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"My second clarification for the Prime Minister is, the Prime Minister mentioned about the interdiction and how he arrived at the pay of $7,500, just a quick clarification, is this in lieu of both Minister's pay and MP's allowance?",2,721,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00721
2023-08-02-T-017,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Finally, Mr Speaker, I believe that Minister Chan has not answered the second question of my colleague, the hon Ms He Ting Ru. Thank you.",3,722,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00722
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Speaker, Sir, I do not think it was a very difficult question to figure out, that when I spoke to MTI, I spoke to the Minister. Because Mr Gan Kim Yong is the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Iswaran has a role in MTI, he is overseeing various matters to do with trade as well as projects like the Formula One (F1), and I thought it was important that the Minister for MTI knows that there is an investigation going on concerning Mr Iswaran so that he knows how to deal with the issue until the investigation has reached a point and the matter is public. It is necessary. So, that is quite clear.",1,723,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00723
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"On the MP's allowance, it has not been interdicted. The MP's allowance is different from the pay, it is not at the discretion of the Prime Minister. If you want to do that, the Parliament has to move a Motion to interdict the MP as an MP and Parliament has not done that. And neither in previous cases, has Parliament done that. What has happened is that the MP has been on leave of absence, and eventually when the case is settled one way or the other, well, then, consequences follow.",2,724,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00724
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister Chan.,1,725,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00725
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, just to put on record. An MP's allowance will be withheld once the MP is suspended from the service of Parliament, as provided by section 29(3) read with section 19 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act 1962. A Motion would have to be moved in Parliament to suspend the Member from the service of Parliament. His or her allowance would be withheld thereafter.",1,726,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00726
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On Ms He Ting Ru's second question, can you repeat your second question, or the second part of your question?",2,727,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00727
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.,1,728,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00728
2023-08-02-T-017,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,"Yes, thank you, Mr Speaker. I think the question that I asked was, did CPIB apprise the Prime Minister or any other Cabinet Minister about the facts relating to the investigation to Minister Iswaran and including information about evidence that became available.",1,729,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00729
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The Director of CPIB only apprised the Prime Minister.,1,730,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00730
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Ms He Ting Ru, I assume you had raised your hand earlier, was that the clarification wanted? Thank you. Mr Don Wee.",1,731,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00731
2023-08-02-T-017,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you, Speaker. A supplementary question to Minister Chan. In the event if a Permanent Secretary or a director or a chief executive of a Statutory Board is being invited to assist with any investigation, will he or she be asked to take leave of absence?",1,732,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00732
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to Mr Don Wee's question is, it depends on the circumstances. The Public Service Division together with the head of Civil Service and if need be, the Minister in charge of the Public Service will have to make a decision in context.",1,733,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00733
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,734,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00734
2023-08-02-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. Two clarifications for the Prime Minister, please.",1,735,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00735
2023-08-02-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I do not think Prime Minister has answered the question as to why it took so long to make arrangements to hand over the residents of Kembangan-Chai Chee to others in Marine Parade GRC, from February to July. He has not answered why it takes so long.",2,736,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00736
2023-08-02-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second clarification is that I wonder whether he will agree with me that the period from February to July actually was quite momentous, many things happened in Parliament. We had Budget debate, Committee of Supply, Parliament was prorogued, Parliament reopened. There were sittings in April, May. And some of us even went with the former Speaker on official trips overseas. So, does he not think that this inordinate delay to settle the matter is really highly regrettable, because it gives a false impression to all of us here, to the general public and even to the outside world?",3,737,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00737
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mr Speaker, as I have said, if I could play it again, I would have acted earlier.",1,738,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00738
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Carrie Tan.,1,739,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00739
2023-08-02-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. I would like to address, on a different tone, some matters of the heart, pertaining to the issues that the Prime Minister has addressed today. I have three clarifications, two of them pertain to the practicality and sustainability of ensuring that there can always be good talent in our politics and the last question pertains to the threats to the trust and the social compact between our citizens and the Government.",1,740,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00740
2023-08-02-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"As I need to give some context to these questions, may I beg your indulgence for a little time?",2,741,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00741
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Do not test it too much though.,1,742,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00742
2023-08-02-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"Okay, alright. Mr Speaker, I think younger people, when they received the news of what happened, specifically the extramarital affairs, in their idealism, they may struggle to reconcile their expectations towards their political leaders with them as human beings, who have lives, who have complicated feelings, relationships and personal lives. And the reality of an MP's life is that we often disappoint our spouses or children who may be waiting at home on the weekends, or at night when we get held back at work, at events, at contingencies in the constituency. And some couples and families —",1,743,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00743
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Ms Tan, I would appreciate if you go straight to your clarification.",1,744,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00744
2023-08-02-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"Yes. Some families withstand this better than others. So my question is, how can we make political representation more sustainable and family friendly in Singapore?",1,745,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00745
2023-08-02-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"And two, sharing a little bit of personal context, I personally would not have decided to enter politics in 2020 if I had not by then found a partner that I planned to settle down with. So, for any political candidate who is still single and have not yet found a life partner upon entering politics, the fact of life is, it is really hard to date or to find potential partners. So, is it possible that we can allow politicians some space for their personal lives away from public scrutiny, just for the sake of ensuring that there will always be willing and capable candidates, albeit single, willing to serve as politicians without being in reality, doomed to singlehood pretty much, until they are past their prime?",2,746,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00746
2023-08-02-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"The third point is, the Internet is rife with a lot of false information and opportunistic narratives, and the way algorithms on social media platforms push info onto our feeds also perpetuate personal bias and social polarisation. As much as there are many young people who are quite discerning about this, there are a vast majority who are rather passive consumers of certain narratives and information. So, what can we do to better protect our young citizens from being confounded by social media consumption that has the power to cause disillusionment or apathy towards the system? Again, this is a point that I would like us to consider and seek leadership guidance on the prevention of cynicism and apathy from setting into Singapore society towards our political system.",3,747,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00747
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, I thank Ms Carrie Tan for her exposition. I think we can understand where the Member is coming from. We have clear rules of propriety and probity. They do not conflict with the aspirations for our personal and family lives. We know the public's expectations for public figures are high. We aspire to live up to them. Where we fall short, we seek to improve. Where we have done well, we must remain vigilant and not complacent.",1,748,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00748
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There will be personal sacrifices. Ultimately, the will to answer the call to serve is deeply personal. And I agree, we can all do our part to encourage a positive political environment, engender a more constructive political culture so that we do not deter good people from stepping forth to serve.",2,749,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00749

2023-08-02-T-017,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister mentioned earlier that there were two keys for the CPIB  the Prime Minister; and failing which, one could go to the President. I am wondering if the PMO has considered potentially extending this institutional reporting line beyond just essentially one branch of Government, which is the Executive Branch? Given that it is also a Judiciary, and I believe in Brazil, for example, the so-called Car Wash investigations actually reported to judges, as well as possibly a legislature. In Australia, the National Anti-Corruption Commission is overseen by a joint Select Committee.",1,751,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00751
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,I am very happy to note that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim appreciates the second key and is seeking a third. And I hope that it portends a change in your attitude towards the Elected President and his custodial powers.,1,752,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00752
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"But I think the Brazil example is a very interesting one. You have safeguards; you have got judges involved; but if you have heard of Lava Jato, ""Car Wash"" – it is one of the, what do they call it, the ""mother of all corruption scandals""?",2,753,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00753
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"So, the solution is not to be found in more and more and more and more layers of checks and balances. The solution is to be found in honest people with integrity, conviction and courage to make the system work with a reasonable degree of redundancy, so I do not have a single point of failure. And that is what we have done.",3,754,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00754

2023-08-02-T-017,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In the UK, the code of conduct is always revised at the start of every new administration, and there is a setting out of the possible sanctions as well. Would the Code of Conduct for Ministers be similarly reviewed more consistently, and perhaps, the sanctions available to be expressly stated for any breaches?",2,757,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00757
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister Chan.,1,758,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00758
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will make three points in response to Mr Zhulkarnain's suggestion. Today, the Code of Conduct is gazetted, but the sanctions are not spelled out. So, it is gazetted.",1,759,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00759
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second point is that we take the point. We will continue to regularly review the Ministerial Code of Conduct and all the other regulations that safeguard our system, and we will do that.",2,760,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00760
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third point follows on from what the Prime Minister has said, and I think I have also shared this. We need to have good rules. But ultimately, the rules, by themselves, cannot be sufficient. We need good people – good people that will abide by the spirit of the rules; good people that will interpret the rules; and not people that will try to go around the rules, if you like.",3,761,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00761
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And what is the ultimate sanction? In my mind, I think in our political culture, the ultimate sanction is not whether someone has committed a mistake and pays a certain fine or others. The ultimate sanction is what will the public think of us as legislators, as part of the leadership team of this country. And we must do what we can to uphold the standards whether the sanctions are codified or not codified.",4,762,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00762

2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Speaker. First of all, one technical issue. Can I ask Minister Chan, Minister Iswaran was put on leave of absence since 6 July, if I am right. Oh, no, no, that was his personal leave of absence. Yes, okay, that was his personal leave of absence.",1,764,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00764
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But on 5 July, the Prime Minister and the Government already knew that CPIB had requested to investigate him. In fact, the Prime Minister knows that the CPIB has been investigating him informally since May, but the formal investigation would start after getting concurrence from the Prime Minister, on 5 April. That is what I understand. But he was on personal leave of absence.",2,765,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00765

2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"This kind of practices — you know, I actually fully supported what the Leader of Opposition said just now about the standards of Government, about delays, about indecisions and all that. But this is another example, right? If you already know the Minister has been under investigation for so many months, why did you still let him go and represent Singapore to meet up with the Chief Minister of Johor?",4,767,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00767
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think both the Prime Minister and myself have set up the process of investigation. When we use the word ""investigations"", I think the Prime Minister and myself have gone through the different stages of investigations and what are the associated actions that we may take in accordance with the needs of that stage of investigation. It does not mean that just because somebody is under investigation, all things will follow immediately. I hope we have made that clear in our presentation. That is the context of how the Prime Minister has judged what duties Minister Iswaran can undertake at different stages of the investigation process.",1,768,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00768
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong Mun Wai, a short clarification, please.",1,769,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00769
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker, Sir, with due respect, sorry, I still have quite a number of questions. So, I will ask one more question first, okay? Yes.",1,770,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00770
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I noted Minister Chan's reply. But by having all these delays in taking the decisive actions, do you not think that this is not in line with the Government's stance of zero tolerance towards corruption? The moment a Minister is investigated, even informally, I think more decisive action should be taken.",2,771,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00771
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mr Speaker, I think we should have a sense of reality. Information comes up, a Minister is quietly being investigated. CPIB tells me as the Prime Minister. Should I straightaway tell the Minister, ""By the way, CPIB is quietly investigating you, please have a care""? It is ridiculous.",1,772,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00772
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Supposing I say  ""You go on leave of absence"". Why? What reason do I give?",2,773,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00773
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"He is working. He is being investigated. It is my duty to make sure that while he is working, and knowing that there is a cloud, he does not make any steps which are going to dig the hole further or cause a problem. And if something like that threatens to come up, I will have to find some way to head it off.",3,774,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00774
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Why does CPIB need time to get ready for a formal investigation? Because they must have all the facts and evidence enough to start interviewing the principal person. Otherwise, if you go in and the principal person turns up and you have announced that you have arrested him and then it turns out that there is nothing in the case, I think you have been derelict in your duty. So, you must make sure, as much as possible, that the case is there before you go to the Minister.",4,775,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00775
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,And when do you go to the Minister? That depends on CPIB's operational considerations. Who is in town? How do they want to mount this? What else they want to do at the same time? I defer to them on these operational judgements. They know exactly what they are doing. They have a good track record and a formidable reputation. I rely on them.,5,776,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00776
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,They asked for permission on the 5 July; I gave it on 6 July. I said the timing is entirely up to you. They said they needed a few days. They acted on 11 July. And that is all there is to it.,6,777,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00777
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"The reason this is here at all is because this Government decided to act – own self check own self. Otherwise, it would not even be here.",7,778,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00778

2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"That is how the system is meant to work and that depends on the leadership, on the Government, on the whole ethos of our society, to frown on corruption, to have no tolerance for somebody who falls short of the standards we expect. And when something needs to be done, painful or not, we do it. No ifs no buts. It has to be done? It has to be done.",9,780,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00780

2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Speaker. I respect what the Prime Minister said just now with regard to the stance of the current Government, but I will also like to make a point that if our current system is not ""own self check own self"", but there are more checks and balances, perhaps, there will not be delays in all these things. Of course, it is conjecture.",1,784,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00784
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, I will ask two more questions to the Prime Minister which are important for our Motion debate afterwards.",2,785,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00785
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Can I confirm with the Prime Minister that, with regard to Speaker Tan's case, what the Prime Minister is saying now is that in February this year, he did not actually accept the resignation. Basically, he is saying that  the resignation is put on hold and you carry on doing what you need to do. Can I have that confirmation? Because if you have accepted the resignation and then you allow Speaker Tan to continue to perform certain duties, I do not know, the legal colleagues and Members in this Chamber may have other questions that can be raised pertaining to this issue. So, this one point I would like to confirm so that I can say the right thing during the debate on the Motion afterwards.",3,786,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00786
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The second point, can the Prime Minister confirm that he would not have asked Speaker Tan to resign, even after the revelation of those offensive comments that he had made in Parliament, if Speaker Tan had not been in an inappropriate relationship with an MP?",4,787,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00787
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, first, Mr Leong is quibbling over words. In February, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin told me, ""I offer to resign"". I said, ""Yes, sort out your constituency first"". In other words, decision taken. The moment to execute it, I will decide. So, it is quite clear. Legally, he has not resigned. In terms of the decision made – I have decided, he has decided.",1,788,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00788
2023-08-02-T-017,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Would I have asked him to resign if it was just a matter of the hot mic, the answer is no. It was wrong for him to say that. It was bad that it was picked up. It lowers the tone of the Chamber. No Member should say that in the House. Dare I say no Member should say that even outside of the House. But I hazard to guess that maybe not all of us abstain completely all the time. But we do expect standards of behaviour in this House and especially in the Chair. What he said was wrong, but I would not have considered that alone a basis to ask him to resign.",2,789,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00789
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong Mun Wai. It is not new. It is a further clarification, I assume?",1,790,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00790
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"No, Speaker, one more question.",1,791,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00791
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Okay, I would really appreciate if you would ask all questions, because there are still a few more hands, and I just want to give everyone an opportunity.",1,792,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00792

2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I suppose the question, I think, is directed indirectly to me.

But as a layman, I am just concerned that anyone of us in the public space can be secretly taken, you know, and it is —",1,797,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00797
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I want to know which provision. If I can have that, then I can proceed to answer.",1,798,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00798
2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, Speaker, then I would say that I do not have the provision. But can I ask for a general opinion from the Home Affairs Minister, whether such an act of secretly taking the video of other citizens, how is it covered under our law because it is an intrusion into the privacy of the individual?",1,799,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00799
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I would say, Sir, through you, that if Mr Leong believes and PSP believes that there should be no videos taken of anyone, as a matter of procedure and law, perhaps he can table a Private Member's Bill. Because, as far as I am aware today, there is no legislation.",1,800,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00800
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Last Saturday, PSP came to my constituency, as is usual, they sat in a corner and had their coffee. Many people were there, welcomed them. Then, I did my usual walkabout and PSP sent someone to video me. Obviously, they did not think that they were breaking any laws and I have a photograph of that if Mr Leong wishes.",2,801,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00801
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, certainly, your party does not think that there is anything wrong in constantly videoing us.

2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, I think on the reference to Private Security Industry Act, I would just say this, Sir, through you, which I have said before. If a question is to be asked, we as Ministers have a duty to answer. But I think, equally, MPs have a duty to do some basic checks before they throw questions. I mean, if you referred to a legislation, then tell us which provision you are referring to. I mean, something must have gone through your mind that the Private Security Industry Act is relevant.",4,803,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00803
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I did a quick check. I do not see anything there that is relevant. So, maybe, I thought you knew something that I did not know. But it appears that, perhaps, you know even less even though you ask the question.",5,804,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00804
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, I think it would be a waste of very important Parliamentary time if Members of Parliament do not do some basic research. That is all I have to say, Sir.",6,805,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00805
2023-08-02-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I do not believe any section of the Private Security Industry Act applies.,7,806,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00806

2023-08-02-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim:,"Thank you, Speaker, for letting me ask another clarification. To the Prime Minister and, perhaps, to Mr Chan as well, I think the issue of whether the Prime Minister's concurrence is required for any CPIB investigation is an important question. I have tried to search for the legal basis for that but I cannot find any section which actually says that the Director of CPIB has to get the Prime Minister's concurrence. The Prevention of Corruption Act talks about seeking concurrence from the Public Prosecutor, but the Prime Minister is actually not mentioned in the legal provisions, as far as I can find.",1,808,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00808
2023-08-02-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim:,"So, may I get clarification as to whether it is just customary because CPIB comes under the Prime Minister's Office, that is, CPIB would inform the Prime Minister of such. Minister Chan did say he is going to make a clarification on this point. So, I would like to know when that will happen.",2,809,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00809
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, indeed, thank you for the chance for me to make this clarification. I would say the following things in response to both Ms Lim's comment and I think Ms He's question on whether we need permission.",1,810,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00810
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, first, if CPIB seeks the Prime Minister's permission and if the Prime Minister denies that, our rule says that the Director of CPIB can go to the President. And if the President gives his or her approval, CPIB can proceed. So, that is the first point.",2,811,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00811
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second point is that in our record, over the last many decades, the Director of CPIB has never been denied by the Prime Minister – this Prime Minister or a previous Prime Minister – to continue and proceed with his investigation. So, that is the second point I will make.",3,812,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00812
2023-08-02-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third point and I have confirmed with the Director of CPIB – when the Prime Minister says no, they can proceed with the investigations and make the case to the President. So, as the Prime Minister enunciated just now, there are two keys  one, is the Prime Minister, whether he agrees; and then after that the President.",4,813,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00813

2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Well, technically, it is out of order. Actually, I was going to rule it. You want to ask a clarification to Mr Leong's comment about —",1,818,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00818
2023-08-02-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas,"Yes, Sir, and also, to clarify what Minister Shanmugam had said about the Private Security Industry Act.",1,819,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00819
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Okay, I will make an exception. I will allow this.",1,820,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00820
2023-08-02-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas,"Yes, Sir. I am asking the question because I am the President of the Security Association Singapore, which also represents private investigators.",1,821,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00821
2023-08-02-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas,"So, the clarification that I wanted to make was whether Mr Leong was conflating the use of private investigators and the general taking of videos in public. The Private Security Industry Act does provide that in a security assignment or private investigation assignment involving a political figure which is defined as the President, the Prime Minister, a Minister or a Minister of State, then there is a requirement to get the approval from the licensing officer. But in other cases, which is what Minister Shanmugam mentioned, where there were people who took a video of him in public, there is really no need for that and the Private Security Industry Act would not apply.",2,822,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00822
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Thank you for the clarification. Any last questions? Mr Vikram Nair.,1,823,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00823
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a clarification for the Leader of the Opposition, arising from his earlier invitation, where he said he is prepared to answer any question about his party's handling of the indiscretion between his two party members.",1,824,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00824
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There is evidence in public of a video by Mr Perera's driver who said he had told Mr Singh as well as other MPs, including Ms Sylvia Lim and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim about the indiscretions Mr Perera was engaging in, including going to hotels, going to restaurants and so on. Could Mr Singh please tell this House why nothing was done at the material time?",2,825,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00825
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The second clarification is  were any steps taken to protect the identity of the driver as the informant?,3,826,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00826
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The first one, can I ask the Member in return, has he perused the entire press conference that was given by the Workers' Party on this matter, where the question was answered?",1,827,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00827
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,I have listened to the press conference. But I have not heard any explanation as to why the driver was not called up for an interview after those details were given. Nor was there anything in the press conference that addressed the issue of whether steps were taken to protect the driver's identity as an informant.,1,828,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00828

2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Firstly, the invitation to ask the question about any matter involving what had happened in the Workers' Party between Mr Perera and Ms Nicole Seah was put to the Prime Minister, but I will answer the question that the Member has put forward.",1,830,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00830
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"We made an assessment of the circumstances in which the driver came forward with the information. There was certain information that I had received after the fact that he had secured the phone numbers of many Workers' Party members and circulated this allegation to many members, significant number of members across the board.",2,831,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00831
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"We approached Mr Perera, I approached Mr Perera with the information that was given to me by the driver. I had explained in my press conference what was said by Mr Perera to me and our assessment at the time was, this was what had transpired.",3,832,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00832
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"But if the Member had listened to the press conference carefully, and I do not think he did, other facts came to bear, such as corroboratory evidence. I think a Stomp article suggested that this video was the video that came out on the same day that the Prime Minister was announcing the resignation of the Speaker and Cheng Li Hui. Stomp reported that the video had been going around since 2021. I can confirm because I asked the CEC the question, my CEC, had any body seen the video. Nobody had seen the video. Maybe the Member had seen the video. Perhaps, he can tell me if he had.",4,833,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00833
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"What had transpired in terms of what was shared – there was no corroboratory information for us to work with and there was no other source. If either of these two criteria came into play, then I think something different would have happened; we would have to look into the matter more carefully, beyond what Mr Perera had shared with us.",5,834,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00834
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"In terms of protecting the identity of the source, I did not reveal the identity of the source, but I had to check with Mr Perera, ""This is the information I received. Can you confirm?""",6,835,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00835

2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"Do you not think that if you received credible evidence from someone who is close to an indiscretion – I mean a whistle-blower, this is how issues normally come up – that you should actually take efforts to interview the person to get more information? Was that done?",2,838,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00838
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,The second is this  you mentioned that you did not tell Mr Perera or you did not reveal the source of information. How did you tell Mr Perera you came to know about this indiscretion? Did you say the driver told you?,3,839,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00839
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I do not recall exactly the whole circumstances of my conversations with Mr Perera which happened some time ago now. But on the first point – can you just repeat the first point, the first question?",1,840,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00840
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"Okay. The first question was, if you receive information from a credible source who is close to the wrongdoing that something has happened, normally, in a proper organisation, that would be treated as a whistle-blower report. Steps would be taken to protect that person and that person would be called up for further interviews. Was this driver called up for a further interview?",1,841,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00841
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"As I mentioned in my first reply, we had to deal with the information that was shared by the driver, we made an assessment of the total circumstances with which the information was provided to us. And as we found out – after the fact of course – this person was a former police officer, more than I think 10 years' experience, I think this was in the papers. I would have expected somebody close to Mr Perera, very close to Mr Perera to have corroboratory evidence at hand. I would have expected that, especially being a driver.",1,842,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00842
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Okay, Mr Nair, last clarification.",1,843,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00843
2023-08-02-T-017,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"I think Mr Singh has not answered my question which was, did he call him up for an interview? Was it conveyed to him he needed to collate further corroboratory evidence?",1,844,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00844
2023-08-02-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,Easy answer. The answer is no.,1,845,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00845
2023-08-02-T-017,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan, you have a clarification.",1,846,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00846
2023-08-02-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, if I can just ask Mr Leong Mun Wai, earlier he had said something about if an MP is under investigation, he expected the Government to do something about it. So, can I ask Mr Leong to clarify, is it his position that if any MP is under police investigation, we should then suspend the MP or dock his salary?",1,847,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00847

2023-08-02-T-017,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"What I said was that when a Minister is under investigation and – in this case, it is not just an ordinary investigation – even if it is an informal investigation, for the CPIB to undertake and keep the Prime Minister informed, it is something quite serious. I would expect our Government's stance on zero tolerance to include what I said just now. That means once the Minister is under investigation, he should be relieved of his duties. That is, of course, my opinion.",2,850,2023-08-02-T-017-S-00850

2023-08-02-T-017,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,Let me ask Mr Leong again because I recall that Parliament referred the Leader of the Opposition to be investigated by the Public Prosecutor. Nothing has come out of that. But is it Mr Leong's position that the Leader of the Opposition cannot receive pay or carry out his duties because he is a Member of the Parliament?

Is Mr Leong saying that the minute a person is referred to the Police for investigation, the MP must be suspended or he must receive a salary cut?

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"In brief, a statutory declaration is a written statement that a person signs and solemnly declares to be true. Making a false statutory declaration is a serious criminal offence. For example, producing a false statutory declaration to a Court can result in a jail term of up to seven years.",4,885,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00885
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Apart from use in Court proceedings, statutory declarations may also be taken for a myriad of commercial or regulatory purposes, such as registering a ship, declaring that a company is solvent, transferring a bill of sale or affirming that contractual obligations have been complied with.",5,886,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00886
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Some public agencies may also require certain applications to be supported by a statutory declaration. For instance, applications to the Registrar of Titles for a replacement Certificate of Title must be accompanied by a statutory declaration setting out the circumstances leading to the loss of the original Certificate.",6,887,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00887
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Given the weight that can be placed on facts set out in a sworn statutory declaration and the serious consequences associated with making a false statutory declaration, the law today requires a statutory declaration to be made in a specific form and manner.",7,888,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00888
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Therefore, a statutory declaration must take the form that is set out in the Oaths and Declarations Act. And it must also be made before an authorised person, such as a Commissioner for Oaths, or CFO for short, who will check the identity of the declarant and ensure that the declarant is aware of what he is doing and aware of the consequences of making a false declaration.",8,889,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00889
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, an oath or affirmation is a solemn declaration by which a person swears or affirms that what he says is the truth or that he will do as he has promised to do.

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Second, a person may also be required to take an oath if he or she is appointed to an office, such as that of a Judge.

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The process of obtaining a notarial act is a stringent one. Notaries must keep a full and accurate record of the whole procedure.

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"This mitigates the risk of forgery, safeguards the integrity of the process and provides foreign recipients with the assurance that they need in order to rely on documents that are notarised by a Notary Public in Singapore.",15,896,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00896
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"As Members will have gathered from the brief explanation that I have given, historically, and today, the process for making a statutory declaration; taking an oath or affirmation; or obtaining a notarial act, is stringent and subject to several requirements, including the need to, generally, appear in-person before an authorised service provider, such as a Commissioner for Oaths or a Notary Public. Further, the process is often paper-based, involving the use of wet ink signatures.",16,897,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00897

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"This is in line with the Government’s ongoing efforts to facilitate electronic transactions, by progressively reviewing and updating the relevant legal frameworks in place. Just to give a few recent examples, in 2021, this House enacted  (a) the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act which empowered the Courts to conduct hearings remotely; (b) the Electronic Transactions (Amendment) Act, which enabled the creation and use of electronic bills of lading; and (c) the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act, which enabled the creation and registration of electronic lasting powers of attorney.",21,902,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00902

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The first aspect is that of electronic meetings with authorised service providers. Where a client is currently required by law and practice to appear before an authorised service provider to make a statutory declaration, take an oath, or obtain a notarial act, the framework under the Oaths, Declarations and Notarisations (Remote Methods) Bill will make it clear that the client and authorised service provider are allowed to meet using stipulated electronic means of communication.",23,904,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00904
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The Bill sets out certain minimum requirements relating to the quality of such electronic means of communication. And we also intend to prescribe further procedural requirements or safeguards that parties must comply with, in subsidiary legislation.",24,905,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00905
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,The Board of Commissioners for Oaths and Notaries Public under the Singapore Academy of Law also intends to issue refreshed guidelines that will assist CFOs and NPs in carrying out their functions under this framework. We understand that these guidelines will include guidance on the circumstances in which it may be inappropriate for a CFO or NP to provide their services remotely.,25,906,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00906
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"In some cases, such as oaths of office that are taken by officeholders under the Constitution or other Acts, the Bills will make clarificatory amendments so as to provide for greater legal certainty.",26,907,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00907
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The second aspect is that of electronic signing. For statutory declarations, the Oaths, Declarations and Notarisations (Remote Methods) Bill will provide clearly that these instruments can be signed using an electronic signature. There are various types of electronic signatures. As a safeguard for statutory declarations, it will be necessary to only use the type of electronic signature that will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation. In deciding the type of electronic signature to prescribe in subsidiary legislation, we will consider factors, such as performance standards, security, reliability and ease of access for Singaporeans.",27,908,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00908
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"For notarial acts or oaths that must be subscribed with a signature – such as oaths administered in the course of judicial proceedings, or oaths taken by officeholders under the Constitution – the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, and the Oaths, Declarations and Notarisations (Remote Methods) Bill do not change the position in relation to how these should be signed.",28,909,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00909
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Notarial acts or oaths arise in a variety of situations, with different needs and circumstances. We will, therefore, leave the precise signing requirements to be determined by the relevant sectorial agency.",29,910,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00910

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The first point is that the framework is enabling and not prescriptive. It provides individuals, businesses and service providers with an electronic option, for the various legal processes that I have spoken of. The framework does not require or mandate the use of such electronic options. This means that the public can continue with their existing in-person and/or paper-based processes, if they wish.",31,912,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00912
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"It follows that the legislative framework does not oblige Government agencies, a Commissioner for Oath or a Notary Public to provide or adopt an electronic option. For example, public agencies administer or require the taking of statutory declarations or oaths in a wide variety of circumstances. There may be important, or simply practical, reasons for physical processes to continue.",32,913,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00913
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"It may be that certain oaths of office or other Constitutional oaths continue to be taken in person as a general rule, because of the gravity and solemnity associated with such oaths. In other cases, it may be that the agency in question has some specific policy or practical reason to require a person’s physical presence when taking a statutory declaration or oath.",33,914,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00914
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The second point relates to statutory declarations and notarial acts that have already been made in a process that involved remote witnessing. For example, this may have been done during the COVID-19 pandemic, when movement restrictions were in place.",34,915,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00915
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Given the lack of clarity in the current law on whether these processes can be conducted remotely, the Oaths, Declarations and Notarisations (Remote Methods) Bill will make it clear that no statutory declaration or notarial act made or carried out prior to these amendments will be invalidated solely because video conferencing was used. This should address concerns around the validity of statutory declarations or notarial acts made in a process involving remote witnessing before this Bill.",35,916,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00916

2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The validation clauses also do not affect a person’s right to challenge the validity of a statutory declaration or notarial act on the basis that some other requirement, apart from the in-person witnessing requirement, was not met.",37,918,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00918
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The framework I have just outlined is crafted to strike a balance between convenience and efficiency on the one hand, and safeguarding the integrity of the process on the other hand.

2023-08-02-T-020,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, with the advancement of technology, it is useful that the Government is considering using such initiatives to allow certain oaths to be taken through live video or TV link, instead of in person. This would enhance convenience, efficiency and accessibility for the oath takers and the oath administrators. However, I seek a few clarifications in two broad areas  authentication and contingencies.",1,922,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00922
2023-08-02-T-020,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, on authentication. With the advent and advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) how do we prevent deep fakes or impersonations from compromising the integrity and validity of the oaths? In particular, will there be other means of verifying their identity and authenticity?",2,923,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00923
2023-08-02-T-020,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, on contingencies. What happens if there is a power failure, a network disruption or a technical glitch for these live links? How do we ensure that the feed is adequately fast, clear and secure for the oaths to be taken smoothly? How do we build in contingencies in such situations? And associated with this, will we allow overseas live links to take place and, if so, under what conditions and safeguards?",3,924,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00924

2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, COVID-19 taught us many things, including having many online options to settle what we used to have to perform face to face. Work meetings are one. In fact, the rules for Commissioner for Oaths were pragmatically altered to allow Commissioners for Oath to do the commissioning of affidavits via video conferencing. During such online commissioning, Commissioners for Oaths are required to verify through visual inspection, via video conference of the deponent and his or her identity document, and that the deponent is who he or she said she is. The rules also require, among other things, the Commissioner to maintain visual contact with the deponent during the commissioning or executing process, and in effect, confirm that the deponent has signed the same document.",6,937,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00937
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"For good order, may I clarify with the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, whether the proposed amendments in section 11, for the affirmation of statutory declaration by remote communications means such as video links, will apply to Commissioners for Oaths administering statutory declarations or whether there is an intention to add a similar clause to the current rules governing Commissioners for Oaths, allowing for the commissioning of affidavits via video conferencing.",7,938,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00938
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, it is noteworthy that unlike for commissioning of affidavits by Commissioners for Oaths during COVID-19, the Government did not at that point in time deem that it was necessary to allow notarisation by live video link or any type of remote electronic means of communication. I can recall that it was challenging for many notaries to perform notarial work during COVID-19, especially in the early days of COVID-19, even though there was still demand for such work. Notarisations were still required, especially for documents to be used abroad for a variety of reasons, notwithstanding COVID-19. A variety of business, legal and even personal transactions still had to be performed, requiring notaries to assist with the execution of documents.",8,939,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00939
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"During the circuit breaker days, not all notaries were officially allowed – at least initially – to do their work in their offices. Staff had to stay at home for sure. Arranging notarial appointments can be physically challenging, even when the work was legitimate and necessary. The proposed changes in this Bill would have provided good options for notaries even as the proposed changes still have some inherent challenges which I will discuss briefly below.",9,940,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00940
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, an important issue is the verification of the identity of the person executing a document before a notary, especially if such a person is not known to notary or may not be recognised by the notary from previous encounters. I will call this other person who is executing a document, the relevant person, for the remaining part of my speech.",10,941,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00941
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"The notary will need to look at the original identification documents of such a person, often keeping a copy of such documents for records purposes. However, for foreigners who come with their foreign passports as proof of identity, especially coming to see the notaries for the first time, or on a one-off basis, notaries often have no choice but to give the benefit of doubt that the passports are genuine, even if they have no idea what the passport should even look like or is authentic.",11,942,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00942
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Similarly, when clients come in with what they claim to be original documents for notaries to certify copies of such documents, notaries will not always be in a position to ascertain on the spot whether such documents are genuine or fake. They have to take the work of the client that they are genuine and notarise a certified true copy of it.",12,943,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00943
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"The above are already the common experience of notaries prior to the proposed amendments, which we are looking at today. I think the new amendments allowing notaries to notarise via a live video link may in some cases make it even more difficult for a notary to verify the relevant person's identity, or when executing documents before a notary via video link, or to verify the authenticity of documents. This is especially as the notary is not familiar with the relevant person and it is not easy to cite and verify the identification document or the documents which are the subject of notarial acts by just looking at the screen. The notary does not even get to touch or flip the documents.",13,944,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00944
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Some practitioners also shared with me that for online commissioning of affidavits, they may have the added reassurance that the clients or deponents were introduced by their own lawyers who helped to prepare the affidavits and these lawyers may be personally known to the Commissioners for Oaths or have regularly brought their clients to the same Commissioner for Oaths for affirmation of oaths. This may not be the case for much of the notarial work.",14,945,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00945
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Further, a notary is only able to exercise his/her jurisdiction as a notary when a notary and the relevant person signing a document before the notary are both in Singapore. It is not necessarily easy to determine whether a relevant person is in Singapore or not when a notarial transaction is being performed online. It will certainly be easier to require physical meeting with a client.",15,946,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00946
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"In short, it will not be easy for the notary to always avoid any fraudulent attempts on the part of the relevant person in some of the aspects that I have discussed above.",16,947,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00947
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Some practitioners may understandably be concerned, that as a matter of professional liability, their conclusions regarding the identity, the whereabouts of the relevant person or even regarding the authenticity of the documents in question are later contradicted by subsequent evidence coming to light after that.",17,948,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00948
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"But the relatively low fees they are supposed to charge as required by the authorities as compared to the fees of notaries in civil law countries, or to even the usual hourly charges lawyers may charge for other types of work. It may not be fair for notaries to bear the risk of having to ascertain certain facts when it would not be cost effective or even fully plausible for them to do so.",18,949,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00949
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"It is interesting to note that the COVID-19 guidance on remote notarisation document in the UK provide some useful protection for the notary in the areas we have discussed. For example, it provides, among other things, that ""the remotely located individual must demonstrate that he or she is physically in England or Wales"" and ""the notary should not be considered and should not describe himself or herself as an attesting witness to the document certified by him"".",19,950,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00950
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Such provisions, by way of example, will give fair protection to notaries. I hope that the authorities can incorporate similar guidelines in any subsidiary legislation or rules for notaries.",20,951,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00951
2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"A possible alternative solution will be to have a special jurat or prescribed wording on the document to be executed by the signing client before the notary for the relevant person to declare and confirm his or her own identity and the location he or she was in. Additionally, such declaratory wording by the relevant persons can even be subject to penalties for false declarations and acknowledgment of being subject to such penalties in the event of false declarations. Of course, such penalties will require further changes to the law.",21,952,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00952

2023-08-02-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, in summary, some of the issues I have raised are already encountered during current face-to-face notarisations, but arguably, the risk may be further enhanced when notaries perform notarial acts by remote means such as by live video link as I have explained above. I hope that the authorities will take cognizance of the risk and issues raised and will not accord an impractically high standard of care on notaries in expecting them to be professionally liable should the identity of the relevant persons or the location of the relevant persons or even the authenticity of the original documents provided be subject to a deliberate misrepresentation of fraudulent conduct on a part of the relevant person themselves.",23,954,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00954

Assuming of course that the verifications of identity are done appropriately and the administration is properly done online with unblocked line of sight, allowing such commissioning en mass online may truly capitalise the capability of e-communication means to reach many deponents all at once.",24,955,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00955

2023-08-02-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",10,985,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00985
2023-08-02-T-020,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam.,1,986,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00986
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Sir, I thank Members who spoke in support of the Bills. Let me now address the questions that were raised.",1,987,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00987
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"First, Mr Dennis Tan asked whether the amendments to section 11 apply to Commissioners for Oaths, or CFOs, administering statutory declarations. The answer is yes – the section 11 amendments are intended to apply to CFOs administering statutory declarations.",2,988,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00988
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how we can guard against fraud and impersonation. Mr Louis Ng asked what steps CFOs and NPs should take to ensure that the client is not under undue pressure over video link.",3,989,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00989
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,Mr Dennis Tan commented that the use of electronic means of communication may come with some difficulties and asked that we do not increase the standard of care expected of CFOs and NPs.,4,990,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00990
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"As I mentioned during my opening speech, the need to ensure the continuing integrity of the various processes was a key consideration when developing the electronic framework. The possibility of fraud, impersonation and undue pressure is not unique to the electronic space. Identity fraud and forgery can happen in the real world.",5,991,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00991
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"To guard against this, the Singapore Academy of Law has existing guidelines which advise CFOs and NPs to take steps to verify the identity of the person before them, for example, by requiring the person to produce a photo ID.",6,992,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00992
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Nonetheless, we recognise that the adoption of technology introduces new ways in which fraud can be carried out. Impersonation through deepfakes, which Mr Yip has mentioned, is one possibility that we need to be on our guard against.",7,993,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00993
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,Technology also has its limitations. It is probably easier for a person to exert undue pressure on a client in the same room without a CFO's or NP's knowledge when the CFO or NP is communicating with the client by video-link instead of in-person.,8,994,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00994
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"So, as mentioned earlier, the Bills set out some minimum requirements that the electronic link must satisfy.",9,995,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00995
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"One requirement is that the electronic link must enable the person who is administering the oath or statutory declaration to confirm the identity of the client. Further requirements may also be prescribed in subsidiary legislation under the Oaths, Declarations and Notarisations (Remote Methods) Bill, or the ODN Bill.",10,996,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00996
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,These requirements can be reviewed and updated from time to time to keep pace with technological developments and to address new ways of committing fraud.,11,997,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00997
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We will also work with the Singapore Academy of Law to update the existing guidelines for CFOs and NPs, so that CFOs and NPs are equipped with the practical know-how to conduct transactions in a secure electronic environment.",12,998,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00998
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"When formulating the revised guidelines, we will bear in mind the issues of fraud and impersonation which Mr Yip has raised. We will also bear in mind the need to guard against undue influence.",13,999,2023-08-02-T-020-S-00999
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"With this in mind, CFOs and NPs will likely be required to verify whether there are any other persons in the room with the client, and if so, who they are – a step that Mr Ng had alluded to and a step which CFOs are required to take today when commissioning affidavits remotely.",14,1000,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01000
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"All this being said, laws and guidelines are not in themselves sufficient. Those who are entrusted with the responsibility to administer the oath or statutory declaration must continue to be vigilant and to take the necessary steps to satisfy themselves of the identity of the person taking the oath or making the statutory declaration and that the person is not under undue influence.",15,1001,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01001
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"With regard to Mr Dennis Tan's point on keeping to the existing standard of care, the revised requirements and guidelines are unlikely to result in significant additional burden to CFOs and NPs. Any specific requirements that are put in place will be those that are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the various processes.",16,1002,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01002
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"In a related vein, Mr Ng asked whether there are methods by which clients can verify if the video links for oaths, affirmations and notarisations are valid, rather than a scam.",17,1003,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01003
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The best defence against scams is a vigilant and discerning public. Members of the public should take care to verify that the service provider they are engaging is legitimate and is not a scammer. In this regard, the public can visit the SAL's website today to check whether a person is indeed a CFO or NP.",18,1004,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01004
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"As with the use of any other online service, members of the public who wish to conduct transactions remotely should also keep a lookout for tell-tale signs of scams. For example, they should check that any links that they receive are sent from the email address of a CFO or NP that they have been communicating with; and that the links point to an established video conferencing platform. If in doubt, members of the public should verify the authenticity of any links received through a separate channel such as a phone call with the CFO or NP.",19,1005,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01005
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Yip asked about the reliability of the electronic link and what happens if the electronic link is disrupted. Mr Ng also asked whether there are any requirements as to the security of the permitted platforms and whether, for instance, they must be secured with end-to-end encryption.",20,1006,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01006
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The Bills are not prescriptive of the specific electronic platform that parties must use or how fast, clear or secure the electronic link must be. Instead, the Bills set out broad outcomes that the electronic link must be capable of achieving. Specifically, the electronic link must enable the service provider to communicate with the client; confirm the client's identity and verify any document that is to be signed.",21,1007,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01007
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"An electronic link will not meet these minimum requirements if it is of such poor quality that the service provider is unable to properly make out the client's face; or if it keeps dropping such that parties are unable to communicate properly. In such cases, parties will have to try again with a better connection, or fall back to an in-person meeting.",22,1008,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01008
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"As for the security of the electronic platform, it is up to the client and service provider to agree on an electronic platform that both are comfortable with using and that will best safeguard the confidentiality of the transaction. The client may also request for an in-person meeting instead.",23,1009,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01009
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"I should add that even in the absence of technical difficulties or concerns about confidentiality, it will still be open to any party to end the remote session at any time and request for an in-person meeting. For instance, the service provider may do this if he or she feels that something is amiss.",24,1010,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01010
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, Mr Yip asked whether an overseas live link is allowed – I understand this to mean a scenario where one or even both parties to the process are not physically present in Singapore. For statutory declarations and notarisations, both the service provider and the client must be in Singapore before they can rely on the electronic framework that is set out under the ODN Bill. This is consistent with the position under existing law.",25,1011,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01011
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"There is an existing framework providing various options for overseas Singaporeans who need to make a statutory declaration or who need a document to be notarised. For instance, they may approach a notary public in that country or seek assistance from a Singapore Overseas Mission.",26,1012,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01012
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"For oaths, I mentioned earlier that our laws provide for oaths to be taken in a wide range of different processes and circumstances. Requirements, such as who must take an oath, who the oath must be taken before and the form of words that must be used, are set out in those existing laws. What these amendments do, is to make clear that any witnessing requirement for an oath, can also be satisfied through the use of electronic means of communication such as video-conferencing.",27,1013,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01013
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"So, apart from making clear that the use of the stipulated electronic modalities is acceptable, the Bills do not make changes to the frameworks under existing law. Therefore, to Mr Yip's question on whether any specific oath can be taken when one or more persons involved in the process is physically outside Singapore, this is context specific and must be determined with reference to the legislation governing the process in question.",28,1014,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01014
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"For example, in the case of a witness who is appearing before Court, it is possible under the rules governing court procedure for the witness to be overseas and to take his oath and give evidence to a Singapore Court through live video link. However, this will be subject to the grant of permission by the Court. There are also existing rules and requirements on this in the Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Code.",29,1015,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01015
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Likewise, to Mr Dennis Tan's question on whether an oath may be administered en masse to polling or counting agents, this must also be determined with reference to the existing legislative provisions under the Parliamentary Elections Act and the Presidential Elections Act. The amendments under these Bills do not change the existing position under these Acts.",30,1016,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01016
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"The manner in which oaths are administered for polling and counting agents – including whether video link is used in the first place – is something that the Elections Department will decide, depending on their assessment of what is most appropriate, to ensure that the integrity of the election process, as the whole, is not undermined.",31,1017,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01017
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked whether consular officers may administer oaths and affirmations or perform notarial acts through virtual means. The powers of a consular officer to administer an oath or affirmation, take an affidavit or perform a notarial act are set out in the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act 1968, or the DCOA.",32,1018,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01018
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Today, consular officers only perform such functions in-person. These Bills do not affect the existing position under the DCOA. We are aware overseas Singaporeans sometimes face difficulties obtaining notarial services in-person at our overseas Missions. Together with MFA, we are studying possible ways, including by electronic means, to address such difficulties.",33,1019,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01019
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, Mr Louis Ng asked several queries relating to interpreters. Mr Ng asked whether an interpreter has to be present in person with the client. The Bills do not require this. It is possible for the CFO or NP, client and interpreter to be at three separate physical locations. Mr Ng asked what steps the CFO or NP should take to ensure that the interpretation and communication is accurately done.",34,1020,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01020
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Today, CFOs and NPs are already required to take steps to safeguard the integrity of the process when it is done in person. Similar requirements will continue to apply under the electronic framework. For example, CFOs and NPs may be required to ensure that they can hear and see both the client and the interpreter simultaneously. The specific steps CFOs and NP will be required to take will be set out in either subsidiary legislation, or in the refreshed guidelines to be issued by the Singapore Academy of Law.",35,1021,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01021
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Ultimately, however, it will be up to each individual CFO and NP to exercise their professional judgment and experience, to satisfy themselves that the contents of the relevant document have been properly interpreted.",36,1022,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01022
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"If the CFO or NP is at any point in time not satisfied with the integrity of the process, the CFO or NP should stop the process, and request that the statutory declaration or oath or affirmation, be made or taken physically in person instead.",37,1023,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01023
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Finally, Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked if remote commissioning or remote notarisations can be enabled through the promulgation of subsidiary legislation by the Minister.",38,1024,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01024
2023-08-02-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"In the present case, amendments to primary legislation are necessary because we are making changes to certain requirements currently found in primary legislation. Nonetheless, going forward, the Bills do provide the Minister with the necessary rule-making powers to adjust the electronic framework using subsidiary legislation. As I have mentioned, the Minister will be able to use subsidiary legislation to prescribe specific requirements that must be satisfied. These requirements will be reviewed from time to time, to keep pace with technological developments and address new ways of committing fraud.",39,1025,2023-08-02-T-020-S-01025

As I mentioned earlier, prior to 1970, all the Speakers of Parliament had been members of the legal profession, either judges or lawyers. Except for the brief period between 1963 and 1964, when Mr EW Barker was Speaker of Parliament, all the Speakers of Parliament were also non-partisan. When Mr Barker was elected as Speaker, Deputy Prime Minister Dr Toh Chin Chye explained that this was a temporary stop-gap measure until the consent of the Malaysian government, which was responsible for Singapore's judiciary at the time, when we were part of the Federation of Malaysia, could be solved, for a judge to be elected as Speaker. And indeed, this was followed through when AP Rajah was elected as Speaker in November 1964.",4,1105,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01105

The position of the Speaker of Parliament exists in almost all modern parliamentary systems.

One of the most important differences is that a judge makes decisions on the facts before them and their decisions bind all parties on those facts.

The Speaker is still required to discharge their duties independently and impartially.,11,1129,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01129
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The Motion talks about Parliament being a fair arena.

They may file Parliamentary Questions for written or oral answer, which Ministers will have to address publicly. They may speak on any Bills put forward by the Government, meaning, they have a say on any and every piece of legislation that passes this House. They may file Adjournment Motions if they need more time to speak on a specific issue and, again, the relevant Ministry will be required to address the issues raised. Finally, if they wish to speak at length on a topic, they may file a Motion, which Mr Leong is doing today.",13,1131,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01131

2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The substance of keeping Parliament a fair arena is, I would respectfully say, largely captured in these rules and the law.

2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"If, indeed, there is any allegation that the Speaker has not acted independently and impartially in his decisions, this should be the subject of a specific Motion. No such Motion has been put forward.",18,1136,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01136
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Our process also has its checks on the Speaker's conduct, should the Speaker fail to discharge his duties properly. The first is the Speaker's own party, if it feels the Speaker has not acted properly in any way. The second is Parliament itself, where Members are free to raise any objections they may wish to or even file the necessary Motion. Third, the ultimate check on a Member of the legislature is the ballot box. As Parliamentary debates are public, every action that the Speaker may take is up for public scrutiny. If there is any allegation that he has been unfair or impartial in the discharge of his duties, that is something the voters may take into account, both against him and even the party he is from, if the party endorses that conduct.",19,1137,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01137
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I think Mr Leong has made some references to the UK and the speaker there. I would say different countries may have different practices in selecting the Speaker. The UK has a practice of the Speaker resigning from his political party upon nomination and actually being ""dragged"", supposedly unwillingly, from this chair to take the seat of the Speaker. This is because of the history of the Speaker sometimes having to deliver uncomfortable news to the crown and for which he may face the consequences.",20,1138,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01138
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, even though the Speaker may resign from his party upon nomination, it is clear that he still has the support of the party that commands the majority in Parliament and, in most cases, was a former member of that party. That would suggest his personal beliefs are likely to be aligned with the party he was a member of. Notwithstanding that, in the discharge of his duties, he is expected to be independent and impartial.",21,1139,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01139
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There are other peculiarities in the UK's approach, including that the Speaker's seat is generally uncontested by other parties and he campaigns as Speaker.

2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"This means that unlike the Singapore system, where people vote for all legislators, including the Speaker, in the UK, the Speaker would not be subject to a challenge at the ballot box. So, his accountability in that sense is only to the Parliament itself, should the majority nominate him again, whereas under our system, as I mentioned, the Speaker has three sets of checks  the party he is from; the Parliament itself; and third, the ballot box.",23,1141,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01141

2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There are other Commonwealth Countries, such as Australia, which have a system very similar to ours. There, the Speaker remains a member of a political party and will have to campaign for re-election like any other member. The Speaker needs to get the support from the majority in Parliament. In practice, most of the Speakers have been from the ruling party, although there, too, were a few notable exceptions – just like in Singapore.",25,1143,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01143
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The Speaker in the Australian Parliament has often had to exercise a much firmer hand than the Speaker in Singapore on Points of Order and breaches of the Standing Orders of Parliament. Yet, despite the Speaker being from a political party and exercising these powers, nobody has seriously suggested the Australian Parliament is not a fair arena for debate.",26,1144,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01144
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I therefore do not think that the fact that the Speaker happens to be from a political party or from its leadership automatically means that he lacks independence in the performance of his duties as Speaker.,27,1145,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01145
2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Finally, I believe this obligation to keep Parliament a fair arena for all is not just for the Speaker, but also one in which every Member has a part. It is important for Members to respect the Standing Orders so that other Members would also have opportunities to speak and raise the points they need to speak. It is thus important for all Members to honour and comply with their obligations as set out in the Standing Orders as well as the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act.",28,1146,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01146

2023-08-02-T-022,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"I agree with the PSP that the Speaker must act independently in the discharge of his duties. The first amendment reflects this. This is being suggested so that the Motion is not misinterpreted to mean that the Speaker cannot be from a political party in order to be independent. The amendment therefore focuses on the independence in the discharge of his duties, which is the standard Speakers in all Parliamentary systems are held to. The Speakers in many Commonwealth Parliamentary systems come from the ruling party and this has never been a basis to say Parliament is not a fair arena for debate.",6,1160,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01160

As I had explained earlier, many of the rules that ensure Parliament is a fair arena, including the rights and obligations that Members have, are all actually in the Standing Orders and the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. These are rules that every Member should be committed to in our shared obligation to ensure Parliament is a fair arena.",7,1161,2023-08-02-T-022-S-01161

Mr Rajah had at one time been a member of the Legislative Assembly and was an eminent lawyer. He later became an ambassador and High Court Judge.",6,1197,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01197
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The second Speaker of Parliament, Mr Punch Coomaraswamy was also a non-MP. Mr Coomaraswamy was also an eminent lawyer and later also served as an ambassador and High Court Judge. All Speakers since then, as mentioned by both Mr Leong and Mr Nair, have been elected MPs from the ruling party. I do not know the exact reason why the first two Speakers were non-MPs, but I can fathom that it may well be because Parliament was young at that time and wanted to have eminent local lawyers who would be familiar with formal procedure to chair the House in its early years. Once MPs had sufficient experience, they were called upon to serve as Speakers and have done so until today. They have done a good job and their fairness has largely not been questioned by Members on both sides of the House.",7,1198,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01198
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Furthermore, even a cursory survey of current elected MPs would throw up many names who have the knowledge, experience, temperament and wisdom to serve as Speaker. It is only if we cannot find one within that we should look without. And we can find many elected MPs to take up the role.",8,1199,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01199
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"As mentioned by hon Member Nair, our Singapore system is different from the UK system, where the Speaker, upon his election, severs ties with his former political party so that he is in all aspects of the job a completely non-partisan figure. This independent character of the Speaker was attained over a long, gradual and uneven process over 300 years, and it evolved in response to the particular political situation in the UK.",9,1200,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01200
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Members may know the origins of the position of the Speaker in the UK. The Speaker is called the Speaker because he was the person appointed to speak to the King on behalf of the House of Commons. The Speaker was expected to provide the King with the politically unvarnished views of the House. It was considered a dangerous position as Speakers were from time to time subject to the guillotine if the King was not happy with what the Speaker spoke. Thankfully, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is no longer a hazard of that office or of your office. And it is in this regard that I will also take this opportunity to congratulate you in your elevation to the Chair.",10,1201,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01201
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The role of the Speaker in the UK has evolved with its independent nature solidified in both procedure and custom in the 19th Century. Such custom includes, for example, that an incumbent Speaker runs in the general elections not under a political party ticket but as Mdm or Mr Speaker in elections, and it is generally unopposed. The UK Parliament also abides by what is known as the ""continuity principle"", where an incumbent Speaker after being re-elected in a general election, would be re-elected as Speaker even if there was a change of the party forming the government. This custom is not something that is present in our system.",11,1202,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01202
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Most other jurisdictions that have a Westminster-type parliament also do not have an independent Speaker.

2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),The Canadian parliament rejected the notion that impartiality required independence and considered it a non-sequitur argument – it was not considered an unreasonable expectation of the Speaker to separate his party allegiances with his duty to parliament. It also determined that it did not possess the customary nor procedural history that the UK had to support an independent Speaker – an argument I similarly make in relation to our House.,13,1204,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01204
2023-08-02-T-024,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"In India, the committee considering this question came to similar conclusions as the Canadian parliament.

The constitutional responsibility endowed upon him has to be scrupulously followed, the court made it clear that his political affiliations cannot come in the way of adjudication.""

MPs can be arguing, quarrelling with one another. We note that in some countries, members of parliament fight in parliament. MPs can be criticising another person in public or in parliament, without giving them a fair chance of reply. This will be in breach of natural justice.",3,1213,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01213

Some of the older Members may remember Mr Lee Siew Choh who spoke seven hours in 1961 in the Singapore Legislative Assembly and you then keep everyone occupied because you just want to extend the length of your speech and extend the time. So, many Parliaments, not just Singapore, set time limits on the length of speeches.

This part, I agree with that part of the Motion of Mr Leong Mun Wai. This is also clearly stated in the website of the Singapore Parliament. The Speaker regulates and enforces the rule of debate. He decides who has the right to speak and puts the question for the House to debate on and to vote on. The Speaker does not take part in the debates of the House but can abstain, vote for or against the Motion as if he has the original vote as an elected Member.",5,1215,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01215

As a Deputy Speaker, whenever I am required to preside over Parliament or to chair a Committee, I am always mindful of this need to ensure that I remain fair and impartial to all the Members in the House. So, I make sure that Members, whether they are from the ruling PAP party, the Opposition party, or the NMPs, they are all given the chance to raise clarifications and to hold the Government to account. So, I am mindful that Parliament is a place for debate on policies and a good debate will allow better ideas to prevail and this would benefit all of Singapore. As a Deputy Speaker, whenever I hear speeches made by MPs from the PAP, MPs from the Workers' Party, I, too, form my opinion on the contents of the speech, but I keep my views to myself.

He could have taken action against Mr Leong Mun Wai for behaving in a manner that was disrespectful, disregarded authority, but he treated everyone fairly and he accepted the apology of Mr Leong and said that he concurred with the Leader's recommendation not to take further action on the matter. So, Mr Leong apologised, Speaker accepted it, matter was closed.

2023-08-02-T-024,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, going to the point of Mr Leong's Motion that the Speaker must be independent, I am not sure how Mr Leong measures the term ""independent"".

Hence, we have the Standing Orders, which are supposed to govern the conduct of Members vis-a-vis one another, and also, the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act which sets out what Members should and should not do, and what it means when you have privileges as a Member of Parliament, how you should act and not abuse them.",5,1233,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01233

2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, let me move on to the first point about the need for the Speaker to be fair and impartial. The major Commonwealth democracies all recognise the need for the person holding the role of Speaker to act in an impartial manner when discharging his or her duties, and Singapore is no different. Speakers must behave in an impartial manner in the discharge of their duties and successive Speakers of our Parliament have acknowledged this. The question is – how is this to be achieved?",2,1240,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01240
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The underlying assumption or presupposition put forward by PSP is that you can only achieve this if the Speaker is independent of any political party. That is their underlying premise. The premise is that the Speaker should not have any political association, so, he or she can be perceived to be completely neutral.",3,1241,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01241
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Well, what does our law provide? The Constitution sets out the eligibility requirements for the Speaker. MPs, except those who are Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, are eligible. And non-MPs are also eligible, but the Constitution requires that such persons must be persons who are qualified for election as an MP, such as being a Singapore Citizen above the age of 21 and resident in Singapore for at least 10 years in aggregate.",4,1242,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01242
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, our Constitution also recognises that MPs can be the Speakers, that is, members of a political party. Thus, under our law, any person who meets these eligibility requirements can be elected as the Speaker. So, PSP's proposal to require a Speaker to be independent in the sense of not being a member of a political party or not being an MP is actually not in accordance with and much more limiting than the Constitutional requirements. That is the first point.",5,1243,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01243
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second point is  what is the practice and the reality around the world? Actually, you will find that in most of the major Westminster-style democracies like ours, the Speaker comes from the majority party, and this is true of the current Speakers of the Australian House of Representatives, the Canadian House of Commons and the New Zealand House of Representatives, all of whom are from the majority party in those Parliaments.",6,1244,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01244
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In the US, the Speaker of the House of Representatives is also usually from the majority party in that House. The identity of the Speaker is typically determined by the party members at the organising caucuses held soon after the new Congress is elected. So, in short, the Speaker is somebody who can receive the support from majority of the House and that will very often be somebody from the majority party. And this arrangement reflects the reality that the person has to receive a majority of the votes in Parliament to be appointed Speaker. And it is quite natural for a candidate from the majority party to be in a position to receive the majority of votes.",7,1245,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01245
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"It is also important to bear in mind that the majority party would have derived its majority from the voters. You do not get to be a majority party without the majority of votes. It is the electorate, it is the voters who put the PAP in Parliament as a majority. So, you have to bear in mind that the mandate of the majority party is drawn directly from the people. And the person put up for election as the Speaker, if he or she has the confidence of the majority, then he or she gets appointed as the Speaker.",8,1246,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01246

So, for the first 14 ballots, he did not manage to obtain a majority of the votes.",9,1247,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01247

At the end of the day, it boils down to how the individual holding the office of Speaker conducts himself or herself, and it is very important that the Speaker is mindful of the duties and obligations that come with the office.",16,1254,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01254
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But equally, it is important for the MPs to be mindful of the duties and obligations that come with their office – whether they be Ministers or backbenchers – and to not make it difficult for the Speaker, because in making it difficult for the Speaker, you also force the Speaker to have to make rulings. It is incumbent upon MPs to not disregard the authority of the Chair, to be familiar with the Standing Orders, to know what the Standing Orders mean and, if referring to articles or principles or sections, to actually know which articles and sections they are referring to, and to not misrepresent proceedings in Parliament and essentially, comply with the Standing Orders.",17,1255,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01255

2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, in conclusion, what I would like to do is to just highlight some quotes in respect of previous Speakers, which really illustrate the point that I am making, which is at the end of the day, it is about the individuals. It is about how the individual in the Speaker's Chair conducts himself or herself. Previous Speakers of Parliament in Singapore have earned praise and respect from both sides of the House, even though they were a member of a political party.",19,1257,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01257
2023-08-02-T-024,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, for example, in 1995, Mr JB Jeyaretnam said when he spoke on the reappointment of Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng as Speaker, and Mr Yeoh, as you know, was a PAP MP. Mr JB Jeyaretnam said this, “Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, as it were from the other side of the House, give you my very sincere and hearty congratulations on your election. We have heard from the Leader about your long reign in this House, but I, Mr Speaker, Sir, have only been under your rule for three years after I entered this House in December 1981. But may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that during that short time of three years, you have gained greatly my respect and admiration for the charm and tact with which you brought to bear to this high office that you have hold with such esteem and honour. It has not always been easy for you and sometimes it has been made trying, and my only hope is that I did not contribute in any way to your trials.” That was Mr JB Jeyaretnam.

Mr Chiam said, ""Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will just allow me a moment also to convey my congratulations on your elevation to the Speakership. Sir, I think it would not be complete if it is just the Leader of the House conveying his congratulations to you. This is to make it complete. You have the approval of the whole House. I would also like to say a word of thanks to the previous Speaker who had a very good rapport with the Opposition.""",21,1259,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01259

And that something is a very well-meaning speech and policy proposal put up by the Assoc Prof Jamus Lim was just written-off in this House, in a very dismissive manner – although it is just a quiet comment. But nevertheless, it is an indication that we need to remind ourselves what is impartiality of the Speaker. Without that we would not be debating today.",3,1265,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01265
2023-08-02-T-024,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The second point I like to make is, some of the Members who have spoken have talked about our Parliament, that we have an untainted record, track record of the Speaker being impartial, but here is an example that we have to remind ourselves that we need to reaffirm the impartiality of the Speaker.",4,1266,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01266
2023-08-02-T-024,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"As a result of that, PSP had decided to put forward this Motion to suggest a gradual process whereby we can enhance the independence and impartiality of the Speaker, that this House remember in May this year, I actually have spoken about the rules and procedures of this House already, in my Adjournment Motion to make Parliament a fairer arena for all.",5,1267,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01267

2023-08-02-T-024,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"So, the Motion is meant to propose a gradual process. As a result, we brought out the historical examples. And at the same time, we have just proposed that for the time being, Government, please ensure that the Speaker does not belong to the central committee of the ruling party. That is a small step. Of course, as our democracy develops, more and more members from different parties come into Parliament, then we can think of reverting to a situation whereby we have a totally independent Speaker. That is an ideal idea that PSP is trying to put forward with this Motion.",7,1269,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01269

2023-08-02-T-024,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Well, I do not wish to go too much on Speaker Tan's case, actually, but just now I think what we have seen is just that there are certain rules that this House has that has just prevented this Motion to be debated in a more open, substantive and thorough debate because of a technical point, that the Motion statement was not done in the way that allows me to have a more thorough debate. I accept that. That is the current Standing Orders of the Singapore Parliament.",9,1271,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01271

These are all just incremental changes and the Government can actually consider this and allow our Parliament to move closer to a fairer arena for all.",10,1272,2023-08-02-T-024-S-01272

2023-08-02-T-027,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the justification for the distinction between the ethnic integration policy (EIP) and non-citizen criteria for open market rentals of HDB flats since both will alter the characteristics of a housing estate regardless of the duration of the tenancy; and (b) whether the Ministry has considered applying EIP criteria for open market rentals when they exceed a certain duration.,1,1322,2023-08-02-T-027-S-01322
2023-08-02-T-027,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) applies to the sale and purchase of all HDB flats. The EIP ensures a balanced mix of the various ethnic communities in our HDB towns. Tenants who rent HDB flats on the open market are not subject to EIP, as their stays are typically temporary in nature and do not affect the ethnic proportions in our public housing estates over the long term.",1,1323,2023-08-02-T-027-S-01323
2023-08-02-T-027,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Flat owners who wish to rent out their flats to one or more tenants who are neither citizens nor Malaysians, are subject to the Non-Citizen (NC) Quota. The NC quota helps to maintain the Singaporean character of our HDB heartlands and prevents the formation of foreigner enclaves, as it caps the maximum proportion of flats that can be rented out to such non-citizen tenants, regardless of their race.",2,1324,2023-08-02-T-027-S-01324
2023-08-02-T-027,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Together, the EIP and NC quotas help to ensure that our HDB estates reflect our ethnically diverse Singaporean character. The Ministry of National Development will continue to review our housing policies to keep pace with the societal changes and evolving needs of Singaporeans.",3,1325,2023-08-02-T-027-S-01325
2023-08-02-T-028,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider permitting one-year renewals of the Certificate of Entitlement in addition to the renewal options of five-year and 10-year durations.,1,1326,2023-08-02-T-028-S-01326
2023-08-02-T-028,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat (for the Minister for Transport),"The current policy allows vehicle owners to renew their Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) for another five years or 10 years. The decision to allow five-year renewals was made as a concession. Given the limited supply of COEs, we must strike a balance between existing vehicle owners who wish to renew their COEs and those who wish to buy a new vehicle. Each renewal is one less COE that is returned to the pool for new buyers.",1,1327,2023-08-02-T-028-S-01327
2023-08-02-T-028,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat (for the Minister for Transport),"Allowing one-year renewals may also inadvertently amplify the magnitude of the COE cycles, as vehicle owners may use it to time the market by deregistering their vehicles only when COE prices are low. The COE quota supply may be even scarcer when COE prices are high, exacerbating the COE cycle.",2,1328,2023-08-02-T-028-S-01328

2023-08-02-T-029,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Law in relation to the concerns expressed in the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) report for the financial year 2022/2023 about the authenticity of quotations provided for star rate items in a development project under the State Courts (a) whether the quotations have been provided by the contractor or sub-contractors of the project; and (b) whether there has been any proactive review of this matter following a similar observation made in AGO’s report last year and, if not, why not.",1,1331,2023-08-02-T-029-S-01331
2023-08-02-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Based on information provided by the State Courts on the abovementioned project, the quotations for star rate items in relation to the State Courts Towers development project were provided by sub-contractors to the project consultant of the project in accordance with the contract requirements. In this regard, the project consultant would refer to four quotations – three quotations obtained by the sub-contractor and one quotation obtained independently by the project consultant. The quotations were assessed by the project consultant and thereafter used to price the star rate item. As the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) had expressed concerns over the authenticity of the quotations received by the project consultant, AGO recommended that the State Courts carry out internal investigations. The State Courts lodged a Police report as there may be a potential conflict of interest should investigations disclose any criminal offence(s) and the case comes before the Courts. As Police investigations are ongoing to determine if there was any wrongdoing, it would not be appropriate for the State Courts to comment further.",1,1332,2023-08-02-T-029-S-01332
2023-08-02-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Courts have informed that processes were put in place in accordance with the principles in the Government Instruction Manual, with clearly segregated duties and independent layers of safeguards and validation checks performed by various parties, including the project consultant, superintending officer, the independent project manager and State Courts officers, to ensure that star rates used for variations were reflective of fair market prices. Specifically, the project consultant was primarily responsible for assessing the cost reasonableness of star rates independently by obtaining one or more quotation(s) from other sources to assess the sub-contractor’s quotations. The superintending officer from the project consultant was responsible for confirming the star rates and had certified the amount due to the contractor for the variation. The independent project manager was responsible for verifying that the requested sum for these star rates was in order before recommending to the State Courts to proceed with payment. In the design and development of its contract management process, the State Courts were cognisant of past AGO findings relating to star rate items concerning other public sector agencies and had, therefore, put in place the segregation of roles and independent checks before payment was made.",2,1333,2023-08-02-T-029-S-01333
2023-08-02-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The goods and services that were the subject of this observation were delivered. The State Courts have been conducting engagement sessions with its officers to share best practices on internal controls as well as lessons learnt from AGO audits and AGO’s Annual Report. The State Courts also regularly briefs its consultants and contractors of ongoing development projects to reiterate and remind them to adhere to the requirements for submission of documents for star rate items.,3,1334,2023-08-02-T-029-S-01334
2023-08-02-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In addition to its existing controls, the State Courts also consulted the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on additional measures that could be put in place to strengthen the management of star rate items. MOF recently shared a good practice guide that was issued in July 2021 containing tips on detecting irregular and fraudulent quotations. The State Courts have shared MOF’s guide with its officers and incorporated these additional good practices into its processes.",4,1335,2023-08-02-T-029-S-01335
2023-08-02-T-030,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Manpower in light of the recent findings from Duke-NUS and IMH on the economic impact of mental health issues on productivity (a) whether there are plans to introduce mandatory mental health awareness and training programmes for employers and managers; and (b) whether the challenges or considerations in implementing a mandatory approach can be elaborated.,1,1336,2023-08-02-T-030-S-01336

2023-08-02-T-030,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The Ministry of Manpower does not mandate mental health awareness and training programmes for employers and managers at the moment. There is a wide range of businesses and they vary in the nature of work, size of company, supervisor-employee ratio, employee needs and company resources. There is also a wide spectrum of mental health conditions and a wide range of factors affecting one’s mental health, some of which are beyond the workplace. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to supporting mental health and well-being for employees.",2,1338,2023-08-02-T-030-S-01338

2023-08-02-T-031,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for National Development for the 28% of HDB's BTO projects still under construction due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (a) how many residents are affected by these delays; (b) what interim housing options has HDB offered to the affected residents; and (c) how does the reimbursement sum offered to the affected residents help to cover the inconveniences caused by the delay.,1,1342,2023-08-02-T-031-S-01342
2023-08-02-T-031,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has completed 72% of Build-To-Order (BTO) projects that were delayed due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. About 49,000 out of the 71,000 households who were affected by these delays have been invited to collect or have collected their keys.",1,1343,2023-08-02-T-031-S-01343
2023-08-02-T-031,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Twenty-eight percent of the BTO projects delayed by the pandemic are still under construction.

2023-08-02-T-031,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We understand that affected residents are anxious and concerned about these delays. HDB is doing its best to catch up on these delays while ensuring safety and quality. Eligible flat buyers who need interim housing can apply for a Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) flat. For low-income households with no family support and no other housing option, HDB will also consider offering Interim Rental Housing (IRH) on a case-by-case basis. Some flats that are used for IRH or PPHS could otherwise have been used for the Public Rental Scheme. Even as we assist flat buyers who need temporary housing due to BTO completion delays, we must also balance the use of flats across different rental schemes to meet the needs of different groups, prioritising the most needy.",3,1345,2023-08-02-T-031-S-01345

Flat buyers whose flats are delayed beyond their DPD will be able to seek reimbursement for qualifying costs incurred for delays beyond the DPD. To further minimise the inconvenience, HDB has offered to pay these affected flat buyers the maximum reimbursement sum that they would be eligible for, without them having to submit any claims or proof of the expenses incurred.",4,1346,2023-08-02-T-031-S-01346

2023-08-02-T-032,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there have been studies conducted by the Government on the direct correlation between employee wellness and productivity in the workplace; and (b) whether there are any initiatives in place to measure the impact on employee wellness resulting from workplace transformation.,1,1348,2023-08-02-T-032-S-01348
2023-08-02-T-032,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"International studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between well-being and productivity. Since 2021, the Ministry of Manpower has been collecting data on mental well-being at the workplace via the iWorkHealth tool. The iWorkHealth tool is a self-administered psychosocial health assessment tool for companies and their employees to identify common workplace stressors. Based on responses from about 16,000 employees, we found that employees who experienced work stress or burnout (i) took about an additional 1.25 to 1.5 days of medical leave per year and (ii) encountered accidents or near miss incidents about two to 2.5 times more, compared to employees who did not. In other words, when employers take care of employee well-being, they can expect to see lower absenteeism and fewer accidents.",1,1349,2023-08-02-T-032-S-01349
2023-08-02-T-032,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"As businesses and jobs transform, employers should design work processes and workplaces with the physical and mental health and safety of their employees in mind.

The study concluded that the race would continue to bring significant benefits to Singapore. To allow time for international travel to recover after COVID-19 and to take into account the construction of NS Square, MTI and STB ascertained that an extension of seven years would be appropriate.

The bulk of this went into providing for the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI). JGI was an extraordinary measure introduced during COVID-19 to support employers to expand local hiring. MOM took on a more generous stance in providing funding to preserve and increase hiring activity in the labour market, given the uncertainties posed by COVID-19 on the economy. The lower-than-expected budget utilisation for the last financial year was largely due to significantly lower COVID-19-related spending, particularly in the utilisation of JGI. This was due to the rapid recovery in the jobs market and the economy in general.",1,1362,2023-08-02-T-036-S-01362

For example, wage support schemes, such as JGI, Enabling Employment Credit and Senior Employment Credit, are administered as automatic schemes, where eligible employers will receive support without having to submit an application. At the same time, we have to institute checks to detect possible cases of abuse or error, hence, a minority of cases are picked up for manual review based on a risk management framework.",2,1363,2023-08-02-T-036-S-01363

PMAs are subject to a device speed limit of 10 kilometres per hour, and mobility scooters must satisfy certain additional criteria, such as having three or more wheels, a single seat, a footboard and be steered by handlebars. Devices that do not satisfy these criteria, such as e-scooters, are considered motorised personal mobility devices. These would be regulated differently under the Active Mobility Act and require mandatory registration, labelling and inspection.",1,1382,2023-08-02-T-042-S-01382

2023-08-02-T-044,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Indeed, elderly men are generally more driven by specific interests when deciding whether to take part in activities, unlike women who may choose to participate for social reasons. We also observed that they also prefer activities that give them a sense of agency. To cater to this, some Active Ageing Centres (AACs) empower elderly men to initiate and take the lead to organise programmes that they are interested in, such as guitar playing or playing pool. AACs also encourage their male seniors to take up volunteering opportunities, such as delivering meals or checking in and befriending other seniors, to give them a useful role in the community. More AACs have also started offering communal dining which draws a good mix of male and female participants, enabling them to form social connections with the larger community.",1,1391,2023-08-02-T-044-S-01391

We have heard from the Leader about your long reign in this House, but I, Mr Speaker, Sir, have only been under your rule for three years after I entered this House in December 1981. But may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that during that short time of three years, you have gained greatly my respect and admiration for the charm and tact with which you brought to bear to this high office that you have hold with such esteem and honour. It has not always been easy for you and sometimes it has been made trying, and my only hope is that I did not contribute in any way to your trials.” That was Mr JB Jeyaretnam.
