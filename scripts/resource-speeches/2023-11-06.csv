2023-11-06-T-001-S-00035,2023-11-06-T-001,35,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, Question Nos 1 to 34 on the Order Paper relate to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.

2023-11-06-T-001-S-00037,2023-11-06-T-001,37,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Any Member who wishes to seek clarifications on the Government's response may also do so during the debate on the Motion. I seek your permission, Sir."

2023-11-06-T-002-S-00045,2023-11-06-T-002,45,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Transport whether he can consider providing additional support to existing owners of commercial vehicles who require these vehicles to continue their trade in light of high COE Category C prices.

2023-11-06-T-002-S-00050,2023-11-06-T-002,50,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take oral Question Nos 35 to 45 and written Question No 26 in today's Order Paper, as well as related questions that have been filed for subsequent Sittings?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00051,2023-11-06-T-002,51,Speaker,Please go ahead.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00052,2023-11-06-T-002,52,Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you. Sir, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) understands the concerns of Singaporeans regarding high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices. My residents and stallholders have also shared their feedback with me during my market and house visits. I thank Members for their questions on this topic."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00053,2023-11-06-T-002,53,Chee Hong Tat,"My response will have three parts. First, I will recap why our zero-vehicle growth policy remains relevant, as the COE system is one of the policy measures, which supports this goal. Second, I will clarify some of the questions that Members in this House and the public have raised regarding how the COE system operates. And finally, I will explain the steps we have taken to address the concerns."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00054,2023-11-06-T-002,54,Chee Hong Tat,"Let me start with our zero-vehicle growth policy, which is important for managing traffic congestion in land-scarce Singapore. We currently have about one million vehicles on our roads, including more than 650,000 cars. It is not tenable for our vehicle population to keep increasing, as it means that we have to either set aside more land to build more roads, or accept higher levels of congestion like what we see in many overseas cities."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00055,2023-11-06-T-002,55,Chee Hong Tat,"The Government's aim is to build an accessible, inclusive and sustainable land transport system that meets the needs of all Singaporeans, while bearing in mind our two key constraints  land and carbon emissions. Roads currently take up about 12% of our total land and the land transport system accounts for about 15% of Singapore's total domestic carbon emissions."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00056,2023-11-06-T-002,56,Chee Hong Tat,"Reflecting the views of many Singaporeans, we have adopted a ""car-lite"" strategy and placed mass public transport at the core of our transport strategy. Currently, 64% of peak-period journeys are made on public transport and we aim to increase this to 75% by 2030 as we expand our Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network. Conversely, the percentage of car-owning resident households has fallen from 40% in 2013 to about one-third in recent years."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00057,2023-11-06-T-002,57,Chee Hong Tat,"Mass public transport enables the greatest number of people to get to their destinations with the least land take and carbon emissions. With our current energy mix where the bulk of our electricity is generated using natural gas, a journey that is made on an electric vehicle emits 50% of the carbon compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle. However, if the journey is made using an electric bus, the carbon emission level drops to 30%. Using MRT is even better, as the carbon emission level is only 10% compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00058,2023-11-06-T-002,58,Chee Hong Tat,"To keep our buses and trains running, the Government subsidises public transport by more than $2 billion annually; and this translates to more than $1 in subsidies per journey. We are also expanding our public transport network significantly – an additional 100 kilometres of rail by 2035, which is almost 40% increase from our current network. Today, seven in 10 households are within a 10-minute walk of one of our 202 MRT and Light Rapid Transit (LRT) stations. By the next decade, it will be eight in 10 households. To achieve these improvements, the Government is investing more than $60 billion in the rail network this decade."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00059,2023-11-06-T-002,59,Chee Hong Tat,"Besides mass public transport, we are also enhancing the first-and-last-mile options such as walking and cycling, as well as access to point-to-point (P2P) services offered by taxis, private hire vehicles and car-sharing vehicles. These provide options for Singaporeans who do not own cars, but may need to use cars as a service from time to time, for example to take family outings during weekends or to send their parents for medical appointments."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00060,2023-11-06-T-002,60,Chee Hong Tat,"As Members are aware, the COE system is an allocation mechanism for our vehicle quota, to achieve the zero-vehicle growth policy. COE bidding takes place twice a month and the bid prices can fluctuate depending on the prevailing demand and supply. When demand is weaker and there is plentiful supply, prices will be lower. However, when supply is tight, like what we are experiencing for the past year, and demand is strong, prices will increase."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00061,2023-11-06-T-002,61,Chee Hong Tat,"Over the last three quarters, or from February 2023 to October 2023, the largest driver of demand has been from Singapore residents. Three in four Category A (Cat A) COEs and two in three Cat B COEs were won by Singapore residents. In comparison, foreigners won 1% of Cat A COEs and 4% of Cat B COEs. It is clear that the increase in COE prices was not due to foreign buyers."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00062,2023-11-06-T-002,62,Chee Hong Tat,"Some have asked if the high COE prices were caused by households who own multiple cars and whether we should impose additional taxes on such households when they purchase their second or subsequent vehicle. The percentage of multiple car-owning households has been reducing – from about 19% of car-owning households in 2012 to less than 15% today. This translates to just 5% of all households in Singapore, since about one-third of households own cars. Given the low proportion, demand-measures such as imposing additional taxes on foreigners or households that own multiple cars would have little effect on COE prices."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00063,2023-11-06-T-002,63,Chee Hong Tat,"Let me now turn to car-leasing companies, which bid for vehicles that are then leased out as private hire cars (PHCs). These companies won about 21% of Cat A COEs in the last three quarters. This is lower than the 27% of Cat A COEs they won in 2022. In fact, in the most recent bidding exercise, car-leasing companies won only 16% of the Cat A quota. Their proportion of Cat B winning bids also reduced slightly from 24% in 2022 to 23% in the last three quarters. The data shows that COE prices have gone up in a period where demand from car-leasing companies has come down, so it is unlikely that they are the main factor for the increase in COE prices."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00064,2023-11-06-T-002,64,Chee Hong Tat,"There are two categories of PHCs  self-drive PHCs and chauffeured PHCs. Both are available for rentals, but only chauffeured PHCs may be used to provide ride-hail services. As of September 2023, the total PHC population is around 78,000 – similar to what it was in end-2019. About two-thirds are chauffeured PHCs and the remaining are self-drive PHCs including car-sharing vehicles."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00065,2023-11-06-T-002,65,Chee Hong Tat,"As of September 2023, about 53,000 individuals hold a PHC Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL), allowing them to provide ride-hail services using a chauffeured PHC. Two-thirds of PDVL holders who made at least one ride-hail trip in September 2023 drive company-owned cars, while the rest drive cars owned by individuals, including their own vehicles."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00066,2023-11-06-T-002,66,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, as I explained earlier, PHCs and taxis complement mass public transport by providing Singaporeans with an alternative option for point-to-point journeys. The demand for P2P services is increasingly met by PHCs rather than taxis. Pre-COVID, PHCs provided around three out of every five P2P trips. This has increased to about two out of every three P2P trips as of September 2023."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00067,2023-11-06-T-002,67,Chee Hong Tat,"PHCs therefore play an important role in ensuring the availability of P2P services for commuters. They also serve more individuals and households compared to private cars. In addition, PHCs allow our drivers to earn a living using their own cars or leasing from PHC companies. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has started a review on the industry structure and regulatory framework for P2P providers to ensure that services stay relevant and are able to meet evolving commuter needs."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00068,2023-11-06-T-002,68,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Yip Hon Weng suggested having a separate COE category for car-leasing companies or treat them like taxis which do not have to bid for COEs.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00069,2023-11-06-T-002,69,Chee Hong Tat,"There are trade-offs to having a separate COE category for car-leasing companies. Similar to taxis, the quota for this new category would have to be drawn from existing categories given our zero-growth policy. As PHC demand is still evolving and could vary from quarter to quarter, it is difficult to ascertain what is the exact quota required to meet the needs of drivers and commuters. If we move too much of the existing quota from Cat A and B to this new category for PHC companies, it will further reduce the supply in these categories and there is a risk that COE prices may spike further. On the other hand, if we do not move enough quota to the new category, drivers will end up with insufficient vehicles to rent and commuters could be affected by shortages in P2P services."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00070,2023-11-06-T-002,70,Chee Hong Tat,"We will study if there are further options beyond COE bidding to address the concerns with car-leasing companies, recognising that PHCs do travel longer distances on our roads but they also serve an important function in providing P2P services for Singaporeans."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00071,2023-11-06-T-002,71,Chee Hong Tat,"Next, let me turn to concerns over speculative demand, including by dealers, as raised by Mr Saktiandi Supaat. We have a suite of measures in place to discourage speculation. For Cat A and B, there are a number of restrictions. The Temporary COE (TCOE) bid must be made in the name of the buyer and transfers are not allowed. The TCOE is valid for six months, within which it must be used to register a vehicle, otherwise it expires and the bid deposit of $10,000 is forfeited. For Cat E, the validity period of the TCOE is shorter, at three months."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00072,2023-11-06-T-002,72,Chee Hong Tat,"Specifically for Cat E, we have seen that the TCOEs are used to register vehicles, on average, within 14 days, way before the validity period of three months. Since January 2023, only one Cat E TCOE has expired. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Senior Minister of State for Transport"", Official Report, 06 November 2023, Vol 95, Issue 115, Correction By Written Statement section.]"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00073,2023-11-06-T-002,73,Chee Hong Tat,"This shows that the dealers are not speculating, but are bidding based on actual demand."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00074,2023-11-06-T-002,74,Chee Hong Tat,"The large majority of bids for cars are clustered within a small range around the clearing price, with most bids being made within the final hour of bidding. This shows that bidders are closely monitoring the clearing price and making bids based on their willingness to pay, while not paying more than necessary. It is typically not in the interests of dealers to bid higher than what is necessary to win the bid, as they have to absorb the higher COE prices since they have committed to certain sale prices for their vehicles."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00075,2023-11-06-T-002,75,Chee Hong Tat,"We will continue to closely monitor the COE market to detect speculative behaviour and, if necessary, we will introduce further measures to discourage such behaviour. The Government will also take enforcement action against dealers who make false claims or misleading representations to consumers on the nature of their transactions, for example, if they claim that consumers would have ownership of the motor vehicle with a 100% loan with no down payment when, in effect, consumers are merely leasing it from them."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00076,2023-11-06-T-002,76,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, let us move to the supply of COEs. Under a zero-growth policy, the number of COEs available for bidding is based on the number of deregistered vehicles. For Cat A, B and C, we are currently facing a tight supply situation because many of the existing vehicles have not reached the end of their COE period and are not due for deregistration. Looking ahead, industry players have correctly observed that the COE supply for these categories will increase significantly from the second half of 2024 before reaching the peak supply years from 2026 to 2027."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00077,2023-11-06-T-002,77,Chee Hong Tat,"Large differences in the supply during the peak and trough years result in higher volatility in COE prices across different years, assuming demand stays relatively constant. A better outcome can be achieved for all stakeholders, while still allowing the COE system to play its role as an allocation mechanism, if we can reduce the peak-to-trough ratio, by using a ""cut-and-fill"" approach to shave off the future peaks and using the supply to fill the current troughs."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00078,2023-11-06-T-002,78,Chee Hong Tat,"We have previously made several moves to reduce volatility in quota supply. Instead of just the preceding quarter, we now use the moving average of deregistrations in the four preceding quarters to compute COE quotas for the next quarter."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00079,2023-11-06-T-002,79,Chee Hong Tat,"In May 2023, MOT announced that we will bring forward the quota from guaranteed deregistrations in the peak years. This has helped to increase COE supply over the last six months. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Cat A supply increased by 11% in the second quarter and then 22% in the third quarter this year, while Cat B supply increased by 3% and 6% in the second and third quarter of this year respectively. However, demand has remained very strong and COE prices have continued to rise."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00080,2023-11-06-T-002,80,Chee Hong Tat,"We will, therefore, do further cut-and-fill to bring forward more quota from the peak years to fill the current troughs, while maintaining our zero-vehicle growth policy. Last Friday, LTA announced that the supply for Cat A and Cat B quota for the fourth quarter of 2023 will both increase by 35%, compared to the third quarter. Industry players have welcomed this move, as the additional supply injection this time is more significant, compared what we have done in previous quarters."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00081,2023-11-06-T-002,81,Chee Hong Tat,"I should also point out that the 35% increase in supply for both categories is larger than the proportion of bids won by car-leasing companies in the last three quarters. We will also ensure that the COE supply in the upcoming quarters will continue to increase in 2024 till the peak supply years in 2026 and 2027. As one motor dealer representative commented to The Straits Times, ""more COE quota will be made available going forward. So, the message is quite clear. There is no need to rush."""
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00082,2023-11-06-T-002,82,Chee Hong Tat,"With the increase in supply, we hope that COE prices would moderate. However, we know prices will also depend on market demand, and demand is not within the Government's control. I need to be upfront with everyone that it is not possible to predict how prices will move in the next few rounds of COE bidding, but I want to assure hon Members and the public that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are doing what we can to address the concerns. We will continue to closely monitor and explore ideas to improve the situation."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00083,2023-11-06-T-002,83,Chee Hong Tat,"I will now turn to commercial vehicles. Mr Leong Mun Wai, Mr Don Wee, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about this segment."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00084,2023-11-06-T-002,84,Chee Hong Tat,"Like Cat A and B, the quota supply for Cat C has also been rising in the recent quarters. It rose 58% in the second quarter and 66% in the third quarter. This has helped to moderate the Cat C prices, which have largely kept within the S$80,000 to S$85,000 range in the last few quarters, coming down from more than S$91,000 in March this year."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00085,2023-11-06-T-002,85,Chee Hong Tat,"As LTA announced last Friday, the Cat C quota supply for this current quarter will increase a further 65%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Similar to Cat A and B, I want to assure our businesses and commercial vehicle owners that the quota supply for Cat C will also continue to increase in 2024 and beyond, before reaching a peak in 2026."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00086,2023-11-06-T-002,86,Chee Hong Tat,"Let me now turn to motorcycles, or the Cat D segment. Mr Pritam Singh asked about allowing a marginal growth in the number of motorcycles, given our approach for commercial vehicles and in view that motorcycles take up less road space. Mr Murali Pillai had raised a similar suggestion in this House in November last year and MOT had explained that we have no plans to increase the growth rate of motorcycles as part of our zero-growth policy."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00087,2023-11-06-T-002,87,Chee Hong Tat,"It is true that motorcycles have a smaller footprint on the roads than cars. However, they can still contribute to congestion, as what we can see from the experiences of other cities. As individuals who own motorcycles may use them for both commercial and personal purposes, such use of motorcycles is similar to private hire cars, as compared to commercial vehicles which are used predominantly for business needs. The zero-growth rate policy, therefore, applies to both cars and motorcycles."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00088,2023-11-06-T-002,88,Chee Hong Tat,"That said, the Government recognises that some Singaporeans rely on motorcycles for their livelihoods and there are also higher proportions of lower-income individuals among motorcycle-owners, compared to car owners. This is one reason why the Additional Registration Fees (ARF), road taxes and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) charges for motorcycles are lower, compared to other vehicle types."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00089,2023-11-06-T-002,89,Chee Hong Tat,"To safeguard against speculative bidding behaviour for Cat D COE, MOT introduced several measures in the last two years. These include raising the Cat D TCOE bid deposit to S$1,500 and reducing the TCOE validity period to one month. Cat D COE prices have come down from more than S$13,000 in November 2022 and have stayed at around S$11,000 in recent bidding exercises."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00090,2023-11-06-T-002,90,Chee Hong Tat,"We will continue to study ways to improve the COE system for Cat D, including ideas which share the same intent as what Mr Singh and Mr Murali have raised."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00091,2023-11-06-T-002,91,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00092,2023-11-06-T-002,92,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to seek clarifications from the Senior Minister of State for Transport. With regard to the ""cut-and-fill"" approach, will there be any trade-offs in respect of the impact on the roads with this initial reduction of the peaks and troughs that the Senior Minister of State mentioned?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00093,2023-11-06-T-002,93,Saktiandi Supaat,"The second clarification is that I am glad to hear that LTA is looking at the COE market, in terms of speculative activities in relation to my Parliamentary Question, and I am wondering whether the Senior Minister of State can share a bit more about the possibilities on what are the measures that we can take to relook into the speculative activities going forward, on the side of car COEs."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00094,2023-11-06-T-002,94,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Saktiandi for his two supplementary questions. First, on ""cut-and-fill"", he is right that there is a trade-off. And the trade-off is this  because when we do ""cut-and-fill"", we are effectively borrowing from the future. We are taking the supply in the future peak years and we ""cut"" this to ""fill"" the current troughs. So, we are borrowing from the future peak years, ahead of time, before these cars are actually deregistered. What it means is that, in the near term, we do have the risk of having more cars on the roads in the next few years, before the cars are deregistered during the peak years."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00095,2023-11-06-T-002,95,Chee Hong Tat,"But this is a trade-off that we have to make in order to strike a balance between the volatility and to be able to do some ""cut and fill"" to raise the supply in the current trough years. And that is also why, because of this trade-off, we have to be quite calibrated and not overdo this ""cut-and-fill"", because there will be downsides in the short term."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00096,2023-11-06-T-002,96,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, on Mr Saktiandi's second question, this is not only by MOT and LTA, but we also working closely with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to closely monitor the situation and, certainly, if there are speculative behaviours that we need to take action against, we will do so."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00097,2023-11-06-T-002,97,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00098,2023-11-06-T-002,98,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) agrees that we need to control our vehicle population in Singapore. However, given the recent rise in the COE prices, we are concerned about whether the average Singaporeans will be squeezed out of car-owning opportunities very fast in the future. As a result of that, I would like to raise two supplementary questions to the Senior Minister of State."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00099,2023-11-06-T-002,99,Leong Mun Wai,"In the recent announced COE quota increase of 1,614 additional COEs, the Government has allocated 863 to Cat B; 546 to Cat A and 200 to Cat C. May I ask what is the reason for the Government to allocate fewer COEs to Singaporeans who are in need and more to Singaporeans who can pay?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00100,2023-11-06-T-002,100,Leong Mun Wai,"The second supplementary question is  would the Government consider scrapping the Open category altogether, because it tends to be for the bigger cars, and allocate the COEs in that category to Cat A and Cat C?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00101,2023-11-06-T-002,101,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, just to clarify factually for Mr Leong's first supplementary question, when we announced last Friday the additional supply that we are injecting for the different Cats A, B and C, is on top of what we had announced earlier in October. So, I would suggest maybe Mr Leong can add up the two numbers and he would then see very clearly that, since we started this ""cut-and-fill"" earlier this year, we have been allocating more additional COE supply to Cat A, and less so to Cat B overall. So, do not look at the 1,614 in isolation. Please add up also what we had earlier injected and look at the complete picture."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00102,2023-11-06-T-002,102,Chee Hong Tat,"The second supplementary question that Mr Leong raised, the design of our system is that we have the different categories contributing to Cat E, the Open category, and then the people who bid for Cat E can then decide what cars they want to use it for."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00103,2023-11-06-T-002,103,Chee Hong Tat,"If we look at Cat C, which is a question that Mr Leong has filed, because we have a growth rate of 0.25%, it is not zero-growth for Cat C. So, what happens is that the number of COEs that we transfer out of Cat C is still less than the number of new COEs that we have injected. So, the overall supply for Cat C has continued to rise, albeit less than if we have not taken out to transfer to Cat E. But the overall supply for Cat C has been increasing over the years."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00104,2023-11-06-T-002,104,Chee Hong Tat,"We will continue to monitor the situation carefully. And what we have done recently, with the additional injections into for Cat C, I hope it will help our business owners."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00105,2023-11-06-T-002,105,Speaker,Mr Gan Thiam Poh.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00106,2023-11-06-T-002,106,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Speaker, I have a few supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. First, will the high COE lead to fewer cars deregistering? Second, is there an increasing trend or decreasing trend for high-end cars purchased as a result of higher ARF that has been introduced? Third, are there any plans to change it to a usage-based system, that is to say, drivers will be charged based on usage?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00107,2023-11-06-T-002,107,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, has the higher COE prices in recent quarters resulted in fewer people deregistering? Maybe what Mr Gan meant was that they then extend their COEs. We are seeing some of that. That is the individual's prerogative because, all along, we have allowed this option that if you extend your COE by five years, then you cannot extend anymore; but if you extend by 10 years, we allow you to extend. It is an individual's decision. But when we look at it from a systems point of view, we have to bear in mind that most people do not extend their cars because we have a policy as well that if you extend your cars beyond 10 years, the road tax that you have to pay will be higher. So, what we have found is that the large majority of car owners, whether in years when the COE prices are lower, also including when years when COE prices are higher, most people do not keep on extending. They actually do deregister. So, that is the first point."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00108,2023-11-06-T-002,108,Chee Hong Tat,"The second point about high-end cars, after we increased the ARF for the high-end cars, the luxury cars, we have actually seen a moderation in terms of people buying those cars. And if you look at car ownership system as a whole, beyond COE, that is why we have the ARF tiered in a very progressive manner. So, if you buy a more mass market car, typically it will be in Cat A; and for most of the cars in Cat A, the amount of ARF you pay will be a lot less than if you were to buy a bigger car and, certainly, a lot less, than if you were to buy a luxury car."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00109,2023-11-06-T-002,109,Chee Hong Tat,"I am sorry. Can I ask Mr Gan to repeat his last question? Oh, yes, usage-based. Sir, we have already been using both. Our policies to control congestion require us to do both. So, we control the population of the cars through the COE system, but we also have ERP which manages the usage. As to whether we can look at the ERP policy, whether there is room to tweak this further? In the past, some people have suggested whether it is possible to tilt more towards usage and then, therefore, give us a bit more confidence on the car population side of the house. These are things that we can continue to review. But I do want to point out that there is a need for both tools. Because if you only rely on usage, it will not be adequate, it will not be enough; if you only rely on controlling the population, then you are also not achieving the optimal outcome. So, I think the best balance is to have both  control the car population, but also look at usage-based."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00110,2023-11-06-T-002,110,Speaker,Mr Don Wee.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00111,2023-11-06-T-002,111,Don Wee,"Speaker, many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are facing manpower constraints and rising business costs which include the escalating COEs when they refresh their commercial vans. I am enlightened by MOT's consideration, as explained by the Senior Minister of State. Can MOT work with agencies, like Enterprise Singapore and PUB, to promote the application of schemes like the Enterprise Sustainability Programme and Energy Efficient Grant so that the SMEs can reduce the overall business costs via these schemes?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00112,2023-11-06-T-002,112,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the short answer is yes, we have been doing so and we will continue to do so. There are different ways of helping our SMEs to reduce costs and to look at how to increase also on the other side, that means, it is not just the cost side of the equation, but also to help them to be able to increase their revenue and improve productivity."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00113,2023-11-06-T-002,113,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00114,2023-11-06-T-002,114,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, I have a question for the Senior Minister of State on the zero-vehicle growth policy which he mentioned, where we cap our vehicles at around one million on the road and the underpinning consideration is the road space as well as carbon emissions. So, can I ask the Senior Minister of State as we incrementally increase our road spaces and more vehicles are converted to EVs, will there be scope to review these numbers to have some growth when capacity can take it?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00115,2023-11-06-T-002,115,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think that will require a much larger review to look at what will best meet the commuting needs of Singaporeans and balancing the trade-offs very carefully. First, we need to recognise that we cannot keep on building roads. There is a cost to doing that because the roads will take up land. So, instead of building roads, if we could use the space that is taking up by roads for other purposes, it could generate more value for society as a whole."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00116,2023-11-06-T-002,116,Chee Hong Tat,"One example I can share with Mr Liang and the House is that as part of the North-South corridor, because we are building this corridor and moving the cars underground and, therefore, freeing up some of the surface space. So, over the next few years as a project is being completed, we will go round and talk to different communities along this stretch of the North-South corridor to explore how we can make better use of the surface space that is freed up. So, instead of roads, we use it for gardens, community space, public spaces, cycling and walking. That is something which we need to bear in mind. There is a trade-off to building more roads to cater to more cars."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00117,2023-11-06-T-002,117,Chee Hong Tat,"Second is  are there better ways to allow our people to still meet their commuting needs without necessarily having to own a car? That is one option, of course, that will still be available to some Singaporeans. But for the majority of households, which as I mentioned earlier, now only one-third of resident households own a car and two-thirds do not. So, the main mode will be public transport. I think what we can do to also meet their needs where on occasions they need the P2P service is to look at how we can also enhance point-to-point services and car-sharing services."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00118,2023-11-06-T-002,118,Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00119,2023-11-06-T-002,119,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his response. I just have a very short supplementary question which relates to my Parliamentary Question No 38. I thank the Senior Minister of State for sharing that LTA will study the issue of PHVs as well as P2P transport further. I just want to ask whether the Senior Minister of State can share what are the likely areas will be looked into under this study?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00120,2023-11-06-T-002,120,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, may ask if Mr Yip could state his question again? I am sorry. Thank you."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00121,2023-11-06-T-002,121,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, I note that earlier, the Senior Minister of State has shared that there will be a study looking into PHVs as well as P2P transportation. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether he can share what are the likely areas that this study is able to go into that he can share with the House."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00122,2023-11-06-T-002,122,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Mr Yip for his question. We have just started this review not too long ago, but the purpose is to look at how we can further enhance the provision of P2P services. So, I would say it is not focused only on the COE issue, even though today we are here in this House talking about the COE issue right now. But this P2P review is actually a larger review looking at how P2P services can better meet the evolving needs of commuters. So, we will share more information with the House when the study is completed. We are now going through the different parts of it together with our tripartite partners."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00123,2023-11-06-T-002,123,Speaker,Mr Xie Yao Quan.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00124,2023-11-06-T-002,124,Xie Yao Quan,"Speaker, on Cat A versus Cat B supply, if we look at the car population statistics, beyond any bidding exercise or even in any given year, but if we look at the population level, in 2012, 55% of cars were Cat A. But this has fallen to less than 50% in 2022. So, that is what the statistics tell us. I just wish to ask the Senior Minister of State if the Ministry would consider redeploying some Cat B supply to Cat A, especially in the longer term. I believe that at least part of the demand for Cat B will not be fungible and, therefore, will not move to Cat A. So, net-net, I am asking if the Ministry would consider increasing Cat A supply, which should mean decreasing Cat B supply, but I believe for the benefit of a middle-income Singaporean household who may just need to own an entry-level car."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00125,2023-11-06-T-002,125,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I understand where the Member is coming from. But I think we need to be mindful of the trade-offs when we make such a move. As we can see from the recent bids, there is a strong demand from Singaporean buyers for both Cat A and Cat B. So, in deciding how to re-allocate, we have to bear that in mind as well. It is actually the same kind of complexities that I explained earlier about why there are trade-offs to having a separate category for private hire cars. Because then, how do you decide how much to shift, to re-allocate? And if you do not do it correctly, it will actually lead to more negative outcomes for everyone."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00126,2023-11-06-T-002,126,Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00127,2023-11-06-T-002,127,Hazel Poa,"Mr Speaker, I would like to seek two clarifications from the Senior Minister of State. Firstly, the  Senior Minister of State"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00128,2023-11-06-T-002,128,Hazel Poa,"The second clarification is  does the Senior Minister of State have a breakdown of the percentage of COEs in the Open category that is eventually registered to the different categories? And when these COEs are being used to register, say, for Cat B vehicles, when it is deregistered, does the COE go back to the Open category or does it go to the Cat B category?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00129,2023-11-06-T-002,129,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, first, I need to clarify that I did not say that there are no additional support given to motorcycle owners. If Ms Poa had heard my speech correctly earlier, I said that we do recognise that some Singaporeans rely on motorcycles for their livelihoods and there are higher proportions of lower-income individuals among motorcycle owners compared to car owners, and that is why the ARF, road taxes and ERP charges for motorcycles are lower, compared to the other vehicle categories. So, just to clarify that point."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00130,2023-11-06-T-002,130,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, if I may just also add to earlier questions on the commercial vehicles. Our Light Goods Vehicles ARF is also set at a lower rate  5% of open market value (OMV), which is much lower than cars as well."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00131,2023-11-06-T-002,131,Chee Hong Tat,"So, we do recognise and we will, as part of the policy that we set, try and see how we can cushion and provide more help for these categories of vehicle owners, while not going against the fundamental principles that, ultimately, defines COE as an allocation mechanism, and we do need to allow the market to work to decide how to allocate the limited supply of COEs."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00132,2023-11-06-T-002,132,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, as for the motorcycles – it is actually not so straightforward because how do you consider whether this motorcycle is used for commercial or used for personal, when the individual actually uses it for both? And in different cases, and for different individuals, the proportion may actually change. Some of them do use it for commercial purposes from time to time, some of them use it more frequently, similar for PHCs that are owned by individuals. So, I think it is very difficult for us to tell for sure that this is the exact percentage."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00133,2023-11-06-T-002,133,Chee Hong Tat,"But what we recognise is that the nature of how these motorcycles are being used is similar to PHCs because you use it effectively for dual use, unlike say, commercial vehicles, where it is mainly, predominantly for business needs."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00134,2023-11-06-T-002,134,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the second question that Ms Poa raised about the Open category, I think I have explained earlier that this is a way for the system to be able to re-allocate, to better meet the demand from the car buyers. So, if the Open category bids are being won and it is being then used for a certain category, it actually reflects what the buyers, what the market demand is."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00135,2023-11-06-T-002,135,Chee Hong Tat,"There are different ways of addressing the need for a more progressive system. But I would put forth to Ms Poa and to the House that COE, while there is an element of that in having Cat A and B, it is actually not the only tool that we have to achieve that progressive element in our car ownership system. Actually, the bigger, and perhaps more direct, tool is the ARF where you very clearly differentiate based on different OMV of the vehicles, how much ARF they have to pay, and it is tiered and progressive."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00136,2023-11-06-T-002,136,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00137,2023-11-06-T-002,137,Pritam Singh,"Just one question for the Acting Minister for Transport. How does the Government, or specifically LTA, determine at any given point what is the appropriate number of motorcycles on the road in view of the incomes of Singaporeans across the board? In the past, we have had situations where motorcycle COEs were transferred to Open category, for example. So, how does the LTA determine and regulate what would be the appropriate level of motorcycle ownership in Singapore?"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00138,2023-11-06-T-002,138,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, Mr Singh is correct that previously, there was a transfer of the motorcycle COE to the Open category, but I think Mr Singh will be aware, that practice has now stopped. So, now it is not done for Cat D anymore."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00139,2023-11-06-T-002,139,Chee Hong Tat,"The second point is that the total number of supply for motorcycles in view of the changing and evolving needs of the users, I think that is something which, as I pointed out in my reply, we are studying – whether they are ways to achieve a better outcome to reflect the intent of, I think what Mr Singh has in mind and what Mr Murali Pillai had raised earlier as well, but perhaps not going to the extent of treating them like commercial vehicles and having a growth rate. Because the risk of doing that is it then becomes a structural change and then, every year you will have an increase. And the downsides of road congestion that can be caused by motorcycles, even though they take up less road space, are still there."
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00140,2023-11-06-T-002,140,Chee Hong Tat,But we will study the intent of what Mr Singh and Mr Murali Pillai had raised earlier to see what steps we can take on motorcycle COEs.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00141,2023-11-06-T-002,141,Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa.
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00142,2023-11-06-T-002,142,Hazel Poa,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State again. Just now, there was a question I asked which was not answered and that is when Open category COE is deregistered after being used to register for a certain category, when it is deregistered, does that COE go into  Open category"
2023-11-06-T-002-S-00143,2023-11-06-T-002,143,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, if the Open category COEs is used for a particular category of cars, then when that car is deregistered, it will go back to that category. But there is a mechanism to then flow part of it back to the Open category, in order for the quota to be re-allocated again. That is part of the system design."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00144,2023-11-06-T-003,144,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the Government's study on sodium taxes in countries where such measures have been implemented; (b) when will recommendations on potential policy changes arising from this study be put out; and (c) how does the Government intend to ensure that efforts to address sodium overconsumption do not inadvertently lead to increased business overhead costs and higher food prices.
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00145,2023-11-06-T-003,145,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, the Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s National Nutrition Survey 2022 showed that our intake of sodium is excessively high, which significantly increases the risk for hypertension, which can lead to diseases such as heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. We need to cut down on our consumption of sodium urgently."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00146,2023-11-06-T-003,146,Rahayu Mahzam,"Other countries have faced similar challenges and the Ministry of Health (MOH) has studied what they have done. Chile has implemented regulations in 2016 to require food and drinks high in sugar, salt and saturated fat to have a warning label. You can find such warning labels on soft drinks, sauces, processed meats and so on, in Chile. Finland has also successfully used food labelling laws to reduce salt consumption over the past three decades. Hungary went further, as beyond identifying food items which have unhealthy levels of salt and sugar, it imposes a tax on it."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00147,2023-11-06-T-003,147,Rahayu Mahzam,"These are useful practices for us to learn from, but we do not intend to emulate any of these systems. For example, our Nutri-grade labelling measures for pre-packaged beverages has been very effective in bringing down sugar consumption. We should likewise tackle excessive sodium consumption in a way that is suited to our context."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00148,2023-11-06-T-003,148,Rahayu Mahzam,"In many European and Western countries, their main source of sodium is processed foods which households buy from shops or supermarkets. In Singapore, sodium comes mainly from added salt, sauces and seasonings, such as soya sauce, dark sauce, fish sauce and chili sauce, and we consume them most when we eat out."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00149,2023-11-06-T-003,149,Rahayu Mahzam,"A key priority is therefore to work with the manufacturers of salt and sauces. Today, HPB offers grant support to salt and sauce suppliers to reformulate their products, through the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme (HIDS). As a result, lower-sodium alternatives are now more accessible. Today, the wholesale price of most lower-sodium salt, sauces and seasonings supplied to food operators are comparable to that of regular versions. To date, HPB has garnered the commitment of 15 major manufacturers and food operators, representing over 30% of the retail market for sauces and seasonings and 10% of the F&B market share, to increase the variety and demand of lower-sodium ingredients."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00150,2023-11-06-T-003,150,Rahayu Mahzam,"The other stakeholder to engage are food operators such as hawkers, restaurants, caterers and chefs to promote the adoption of lower-sodium ingredients. We will have to explain to them the need to cut our sodium intake, introduce them to lower-sodium ingredients, as well as provide them with samples that they can try out so that we can get them to use these products. We also hope that they will help us explain to the public that salt is an acquired taste and that if we over-consume it over some time, our taste buds will get accustomed to it and fail to taste other natural ingredients. We are planning a series of engagement sessions with them, including with the industry and professional associations."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00151,2023-11-06-T-003,151,Rahayu Mahzam,"Finally, HPB will also be stepping up its public education campaign. In Singapore, less salt often means more taste as it allows us to appreciate the natural flavours of the herbs, spices and other ingredients typically used in local cuisine. HPB will continue to educate Singaporeans on the need to cut sodium, increase their receptiveness to using lower-sodium ingredients and change the perception that we need more salt and sauces for flavourful dishes. It will conduct more activities, such as food sampling activities at supermarkets."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00152,2023-11-06-T-003,152,Speaker,Dr Lim.
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00153,2023-11-06-T-003,153,Lim Wee Kiak,"Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary the reply. I would like to check what is the price differential now between potassium salt versus sodium salt currently in the market? I mean, after all the efforts that you have done, does HPB know what is the number of households that have switched over to potassium salt?"
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00154,2023-11-06-T-003,154,Lim Wee Kiak,"And on the impact on businesses, she mentioned a grant was given for the food processing businesses for them to use potassium salt for their products. How much grant has been issued and what are the plans to promote this scheme further, including to the households as well?"
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00155,2023-11-06-T-003,155,Rahayu Mahzam,"I thank the Member for the questions. I do not have the specific numbers and the data that the Member has requested. But if he so wishes, he can file another Parliamentary Question and I can provide information."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00156,2023-11-06-T-003,156,Rahayu Mahzam,"I want to explain that we are cognisant of the concerns of consumers, especially in relation to the cost, as we move to the lower -sodium products. And we actually take a multi-pronged approach and an upstream approach in this to ensure that various stakeholders are with us and therefore will help alleviate the issues of cost."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00157,2023-11-06-T-003,157,Rahayu Mahzam,"Firstly, as I mentioned, the HPB has been offering grant support to suppliers to reformulate their products through the HIDS and this includes salt and sauce suppliers. With this grant, the wholesale prices of low-sodium salt, low-sodium sauces have actually reduced. Actually, all of the low-sodium salt is comparable now with the regular salt and half of the low-sodium sauces supplied in the market are comparable to the prices of the regular products. And now, we are still working on how we can enhance existing schemes further so that we can narrow this price differential even further especially for the low-sodium sauces as compared to the regular sauces."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00158,2023-11-06-T-003,158,Rahayu Mahzam,"Secondly, we are also now involving the different suppliers on board to supply the lower-sodium salt to the food sectors and actually, in total, these three suppliers supply close to half of the food service salt market share. That includes  250 hawkers, coffeeshops and food courts island-wide, as well as about 150 caterers that are already using the lower-sodium products. So, if there is anything to go by, these are healthy numbers which show growing appreciation and support for these efforts, and HPB has also garnered the commitment of major manufacturers and leaders in the food service sector to reduce sodium in their products and their food. So, this I think is something that we are going to continue to build on."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00159,2023-11-06-T-003,159,Rahayu Mahzam,"The third prong of this effort is, of course, our public education and that is important because it is not just the upstream and the supply but also public. So, there is going to be efforts that we are going to be complementing. As I mentioned earlier, there are going to be campaigns. There has been actually a campaign, and this is a multi-year public education campaign to raise awareness of the effects of high sodium intake, educate public on the available lower-sodium alternatives and ways to actually replace salt totally without compromising on taste. So, we are looking at a multi-pronged upstream effort, which we hope will then change the ecosystem and have everybody on board in this effort."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00160,2023-11-06-T-003,160,Speaker,Dr Lim Wee Kiak.
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00161,2023-11-06-T-003,161,Lim Wee Kiak,"Thank you, Sir. As a follow-up question – will the food labelling of low-sodium food products and sauces be made mandatory? Or the other way around  will high-sodium food warning signs and labels be made mandatory?"
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00162,2023-11-06-T-003,162,Rahayu Mahzam,"As how we had approached it with the lower sugar effort, I think we are going to look at the market and see how we can do this better. It will probably come in phases because, as the Member knows, we need to prepare the operators and the providers as well. So, this is something that we will announce as we roll it out and hopefully, we bring the whole community with us on this."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00163,2023-11-06-T-003,163,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00164,2023-11-06-T-003,164,He Ting Ru,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just one supplementary question based on the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's answer. I just wanted to check, the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned t"
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00165,2023-11-06-T-003,165,Rahayu Mahzam,"Thank you for the question. As I explained to Dr Lim earlier, I do not have the specific numbers and data here and I will be happy to answer the question if the Member files an additional question. But earlier, I also alluded to the different numbers and the different parties that we have been working with and the uptake on that front. We are continuing in these efforts."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00166,2023-11-06-T-003,166,Rahayu Mahzam,"I think this is all hands on deck and a multi-pronged approach, upstream approach on this. If we do work with the suppliers, the costs then need not be transferred to the hawkers, to the restaurants, all consumers will also not be affected."
2023-11-06-T-003-S-00167,2023-11-06-T-003,167,Rahayu Mahzam,"So, I hope that something is that we can get Members to also continue to share and encourage – these are different groups that we are talking about. We are working upstream, but at the same time, we also need the community to avail themselves to some of these products. Because as you know, when there is a higher demand for healthier food, for low-sodium options, this will also encourage the food service providers to move towards this direction. So, I hope that there will be a whole-of-community support in this effort."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00168,2023-11-06-T-004,168,Desmond Choo,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the recent digital banking disruptions by large local banks on 14 October 2023 are within MAS' expectations; (b) what has been the cost to consumers and business entities reliant on such banking services due to the recent disruptions; and (c) how will MAS ensure that consumers and business entities are given early warning of such service disruptions.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00169,2023-11-06-T-004,169,See Jinli Jean,asked the Prime Minister whether MAS will consider (i) imposing user-centric accountability measures on banks such as the requirement to publish service reliability reports of digital banking services and proactively engage customers on service recovery and alternative options during outages and (ii) requiring banks to compensate their banking customers who suffer financial losses due to outages.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00170,2023-11-06-T-004,170,Poh Li San,asked the Prime Minister with regard to the disruption to the digital banking services of DBS and Citibank on 14 October 2023 (a) whether MAS has any data on how many (i) customers and (ii) businesses have been affected; and (b) whether local banks are required to maintain robust levels of redundancy in critical banking infrastructure such as the data centre that is maintained by third-party service providers.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00171,2023-11-06-T-004,171,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Prime Minister (a) what lessons can be drawn from the recent disruptions to digital banking services of DBS and Citibank, in view that these occurred despite MAS' tightened Business Continuity Management (BCM) guidelines for financial institutions to better manage such disruptions; (b) whether MAS will consider regulating data centre service providers that serve major financial institutions in Singapore; and (c) how does MAS plan to tighten the oversight of its BCM guidelines on financial institutions in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00172,2023-11-06-T-004,172,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Monetary Authority of Singapore (i) conducts regular inspections and off-site reviews of outsourced parties to handle critical IT and infrastructure systems for the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and (ii) assesses the impact of outsourcing on the resilience of D-SIBs' IT infrastructure; and (b) if not, why."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00173,2023-11-06-T-004,173,Desmond Choo,asked the Prime Minister (a) how does Singapore's penalty framework on digital banking disruptions committed by financial institutions compare with other large financial centers overseas; and (b) how effective have the penalties been in improving such service reliability.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00174,2023-11-06-T-004,174,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Prime Minister with the greater reliance on digital services for payment and other financial services and in light of the impact on consumers due to recent disruption of banking services, whether MAS will be requiring financial institutions and their service providers to take further measures to strengthen the resilience and reliability of their digital services."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00175,2023-11-06-T-004,175,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Prime Minister whether the Government has put in place minimum redundancy requirements and monitors concentration risk in the use of data centres by key local financial institutions.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00176,2023-11-06-T-004,176,Alvin Tan,"Sir, may I have your permission to answer all the Parliamentary Question (PQ) nos 47 to 54 in today's Order Paper, as well as the questions filed by Members for subsequent Sittings relating to the banking services disruption of DBS and Citibank on 14 October 2023?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00177,2023-11-06-T-004,177,Speaker,Please proceed.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00178,2023-11-06-T-004,178,Alvin Tan,"Thank you, Sir. If Members are satisfied with the response, they may wish to withdraw their questions after my response."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00179,2023-11-06-T-004,179,Alvin Tan,"Let me start with the causes and impact of the disruption on Saturday, 14 October 2023. DBS and Citibank experienced system outages in the mid-afternoon of 14 October 2023, which affected their banking as well as their payment services. These outages were caused by a malfunction of the cooling system in the data centre hosting both DBS' and Citibank's IT systems. These IT systems support the delivery of retail and corporate banking services. The temperature in the data centre rose above the optimal operating range, causing the banks' IT systems to shut down."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00180,2023-11-06-T-004,180,Alvin Tan,"To restore the impacted services, DBS and Citibank immediately activated their IT disaster recovery and business continuity plans. However, both banks encountered technical issues which prevented them from fully recovering their affected systems at their respective back-up data centres  DBS due to a network misconfiguration and Citibank due to connectivity issues. Services at DBS and Citibank were progressively recovered from 8.21 pm and 7.05 pm respectively on 14 October, but only fully recovered in the early hours of 15 October."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00181,2023-11-06-T-004,181,Alvin Tan,"The impact of the service outage was wide. Up to 810,000 attempts to access the digital banking platforms of both banks were estimated to have failed between 2.54 pm on 14 October 2023 and 4.47 am on 15 October 2023. Approximately 2.5 million payment and ATM transactions could not be completed. DBS reopened its branches from 5.30 pm to 9.30 pm on 14 October to assist affected customers. Both banks provided updates via their social media platforms."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00182,2023-11-06-T-004,182,Alvin Tan,"Let me now address the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s requirements on  one, banks' business continuity; two, IT infrastructure resilience; three, their outsourced services involving critical IT systems. MAS requires banks to establish IT disaster recovery plans and to test these plans regularly. Banks must conduct disaster recovery exercises with their back-up data centres to validate that critical systems and services can be restored within four hours of an outage. The unscheduled downtime for a critical system affecting a bank's operations or service to customers must not exceed four hours within any 12-month period."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00183,2023-11-06-T-004,183,Alvin Tan,"MAS does not oversee banks' external service providers, which are typically not financial institutions. This is similar to the approach taken by regulators in other major jurisdictions. The onus is on the banks to ensure that the external service providers they appoint to support their operations or service to customers, can meet MAS' requirements on operational resilience. MAS also requires banks to maintain close oversight of the external service providers, so that they can deliver services with minimal disruptions."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00184,2023-11-06-T-004,184,Alvin Tan,"DBS and Citibank have fallen short of MAS' requirements to ensure that their critical IT systems are resilient against prolonged disruptions. While both banks conducted annual exercises to test the recovery of their IT systems at the back-up data centres, the specific issues that led to the delays in system recovery on 14 October did not surface during those tests."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00185,2023-11-06-T-004,185,Alvin Tan,I will now elaborate on the accountability and remediation measures taken to uphold the reliability and recoverability of banking services.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00186,2023-11-06-T-004,186,Alvin Tan,"First, accountability and holding banks accountable. Under the Banking Act, MAS can impose a fine of up to $100,000 on financial institutions found in breach of MAS' requirements on technology risk management. With the passing of the Financial Services and Markets Act in 2022, which will progressively come into force next year, the fine quantum will be increased to a maximum of $1 million. The fine quantum is consistent with existing local penalty regimes, such as those under the Telecommunications Act and the Personal Data Protection Act."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00187,2023-11-06-T-004,187,Alvin Tan,"Besides fines, MAS uses a range of regulatory tools to address lapses in banks' risk management. This includes additional capital requirements and suspension of specified businesses or activities. In May 2023, in response to repeated outages, MAS imposed a multiplier of 1.8 times to DBS' risk weighted assets for operational risk. This translated to approximately S$1.6 billion in total additional regulatory capital at the time. Holding additional regulatory capital comes with costs for the bank. It increases the cost of capital and it is a key metric that drives business decisions such as dividends and investments. It is a drag on the return on capital, which could in turn impact credit ratings as well as the stock price of the bank."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00188,2023-11-06-T-004,188,Alvin Tan,"Banks are also accountable to their customers, but matters of compensation are better dealt with between the bank and its customers as it would be highly dependent on individual cases and circumstances. MAS expects banks to have a fair process to deal with this."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00189,2023-11-06-T-004,189,Alvin Tan,"Second, remediation. MAS has instructed both DBS and Citibank to conduct thorough investigations into the root causes of the incidents that occurred on 14 October, as well as to put in place remediation measures to minimise future disruptions and outages and to strengthen their recoverability in the event of an outage. In addition, the banks are required to provide to MAS, regular system availability reports relating to their critical systems. MAS will also work with the financial industry to incorporate key learnings from these incidents into all banks' risk management controls, MAS' future technology risk supervisory approach as well as the next financial sector business continuity exercise, which is scheduled for 2024."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00190,2023-11-06-T-004,190,Alvin Tan,"MAS has adopted a tougher stance against DBS because it experienced five disruptions to its banking services in the last eight months. This is unacceptable. As directed by MAS, DBS convened a Special Board Committee earlier this year to oversee a full review of its IT resilience by an independent external expert. The review was completed in August and DBS has set out a technology resiliency roadmap to address the findings and to improve system resilience."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00191,2023-11-06-T-004,191,Alvin Tan,"To ensure that DBS keeps a sharp focus on restoring the resilience of its digital banking services, MAS has prohibited DBS from making any non-essential IT changes or acquiring any new business ventures for a six-month period. There must not be any distractions that take away the needed resources and attention by the bank to strengthen its technology risk management systems and controls. MAS has also barred DBS from reducing the size of its branch and ATM networks in Singapore until MAS is satisfied with the progress of DBS' remediation."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00192,2023-11-06-T-004,192,Alvin Tan,"Another dimension of remediation has to do with data centres, which host the IT systems of not just the banks but also other critical sectors. The Government is studying ways to further strengthen the security and resilience of data centres, where lapses could result in a significant impact."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00193,2023-11-06-T-004,193,Alvin Tan,"Finally, contingency. Contingency measures in the face of banking disruptions are key. No IT system is infallible. Disruptions can occur for a variety of reasons and can happen without warning. When they do occur, MAS expects banks to take prompt action to reduce inconvenience and costs to customers. This includes being proactive and transparent in updating affected customers on the status of service recovery and alternative services."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00194,2023-11-06-T-004,194,Alvin Tan,"While our banking system is generally robust, customers too must plan and prepare for contingencies. They can benefit from having alternative payment options and not be over-reliant on one provider for time-sensitive transactions. Indeed, during the recent service disruption, customers who were able to switch to alternative payment methods or providers or use cash as a last resort would have been less affected."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00195,2023-11-06-T-004,195,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, the digitalisation of financial services has brought significant conveniences to the public. While some disruption from time to time is unavoidable, we expect financial institutions to build and strengthen their capabilities to safely recover from any disruption within a reasonable time period. Where financial institutions fail to do so, as with this incident, MAS will work with them to thoroughly investigate the incident, apply lessons learnt in our supervisory oversight of the financial industry and take necessary action to further strengthen the resilience of financial service delivery."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00196,2023-11-06-T-004,196,Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00197,2023-11-06-T-004,197,Desmond Choo,"Mr Speaker, I have two clarifications for Minister of State Tan. I want to thank the Minister of State for reassuring us that there is a good plan laid out to strengthen our banking system."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00198,2023-11-06-T-004,198,Desmond Choo,"The first supplementary question is, over the last eight months as the Minister of State had pointed out, there were different parts of the digital banking system that has failed. Is the regulatory regime sufficiently tough enough of a deterrence to get the bank to focus its attention on strengthening the system? Because quite certainly, the non-essential items that were proposed, for example, merger and acquisitions (M&As) really depends on whether they have any in the pipeline. If they do not, then this will be nothing short of a slap on the wrist. How do these punishments compare to what we have in regimes overseas?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00199,2023-11-06-T-004,199,Desmond Choo,"The second one is, through the course of the last eight months, there were various breakdowns. Certainly, DBS would have the system to warn consumers and users of the banking system, that there was a possible disruption and they should prepare for alternative ways of conducting business. Because many consumers were caught out – some of them were in restaurants, some of them were running their businesses. But they were not warned of these until they had to start to pay. Nowadays, we get alerts quite frequently using the app or SMSes. Is this something the MAS will get DBS to consider?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00200,2023-11-06-T-004,200,Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. First of all, I want to reiterate that  one, the banks have fallen short of MAS' requirements and expectations; two, that the outages and the length of time that are required to restore services are unacceptable; and three, the banks and the financial institutions involved are being held accountable. How so? First, I mentioned earlier on that DBS is required to hold regulatory capital. Members will know that this will be at great cost to the bank, as I had mentioned earlier on."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00201,2023-11-06-T-004,201,Alvin Tan,"Second, they are also other measures. The bank, or DBS in this case, is not allowed to make any IT changes and also to involve themselves in any acquisitions, and the third, is that they are not to decrease the number of physical ATMs and branches."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00202,2023-11-06-T-004,202,Alvin Tan,"If you look at these as a whole, there is an impact on the banks in terms of regulatory capital that is costly to the bank – that is one. Second, in the whole suite of measures, this is meant to allow for them to focus all of their attention into this – that they have the time, attention and resources to focus on this."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00203,2023-11-06-T-004,203,Alvin Tan,"The third aspect of it, is to slow down the reduction of the number of ATMs and branches is also critical. Because while we want to be digital-first, in our approach to digitalisation, we cannot be digital-only. And therefore, all of these measures are, we think, at this point in time commensurate, but we will review them."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00204,2023-11-06-T-004,204,Alvin Tan,"If the banks' response and mediation measures are not adequate, MAS will take further necessary actions to ensure that that is so."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00205,2023-11-06-T-004,205,Speaker,Mr Ang Wei Neng.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00206,2023-11-06-T-004,206,Ang Wei Neng,"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister of State Tan for the very comprehensive reply. First, I would like to congratulate DBS for making record profit in the first half of this year, at more than $5 billion, which is a 45% rise compared to the same period in the previous year."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00207,2023-11-06-T-004,207,Ang Wei Neng,"However, we note that DBS' IT and banking system has continued to have a lot of disruptions, despite the additional measures imposed by MAS, including the increase in capital requirement. So, that does not have a big impact on them. I would like to ask the Minister of State, will MAS consider asking banks with these sort of disruptions to compensate directly to the bank customer, as that may have more impact than what MAS has imposed?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00208,2023-11-06-T-004,208,Alvin Tan,"I thank Mr Ang Wei Neng for his supplementary questions. As I mentioned earlier on, the banks are and will be held accountable. First, through MAS' actions – which I mentioned and went into detail on – how imposition of regulatory capital will impact the banks; in addition, it will be a drag on the return of capital, it could impact their credit ratings and it could impact their stock price. That is one."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00209,2023-11-06-T-004,209,Alvin Tan,"DBS, on its own, also has acknowledged that the bank had fallen short of expectations and that senior management will be held accountable. This is in line with MAS' expectation for incentive structure, the bank's incentive structure to promote accountability. The bank will reflect this in its year-end compensation process."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00210,2023-11-06-T-004,210,Alvin Tan,"So, all of these in concert is meant to send a very strong message that this is unacceptable and that we are holding banks accountable. But it does not stop there."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00211,2023-11-06-T-004,211,Alvin Tan,"The review will take place. We will look at what the banks have put in place during this period, how they are remediating, how they are fixing, how they are restoring this and, if necessary, we will have more – MAS will impose, potentially, more measures as necessary."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00212,2023-11-06-T-004,212,Alvin Tan,"Thirdly, consumers also will hold banks accountable. If I am unable to pay using one of the financial services providers, then I go to the other one; and if I lose confidence in one, I go to the other one."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00213,2023-11-06-T-004,213,Alvin Tan,"So, I think number one, MAS will and is holding the banks accountable; two, the bank is holding itself accountable; and three, consumers can also hold the financial institutions accountable."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00214,2023-11-06-T-004,214,Speaker,Ms Jessica Tan.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00215,2023-11-06-T-004,215,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just have one clarification for Minister of State. He mentioned in his reply that the two banks had done their testing – they had the plans, they had done their testing. But despite the testing, which was done annually, these errors did still occur"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00216,2023-11-06-T-004,216,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"So, is there a need to review the kind of testings and the requirements for the reporting of those testings, or further measures to be taken to ensure reliability?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00217,2023-11-06-T-004,217,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"I must thank the Minister of State for the earlier reply also, because I thought it was quite comprehensive. But it still requires the banks to adhere and also to ensure that the level of adherence is done."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00218,2023-11-06-T-004,218,Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank Ms Jessica Tan for her question. I think she raises a very important point. Let me take this in some detail."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00219,2023-11-06-T-004,219,Alvin Tan,"First, DBS' review; second, Citibank's review and then what MAS expects of all financial institutions, learning particularly from this incident, but also learning from the disruptions by financial institutions over the course of the last year or so."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00220,2023-11-06-T-004,220,Alvin Tan,"First, DBS' review, which was completed just a couple of months ago in 2023, has four pillars  first, technology risks, governance and oversight; second, incident management; third, how do you strengthen your system's resilience; and fourth, change management. So, DBS is undertaking this and they will look into this in detail."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00221,2023-11-06-T-004,221,Alvin Tan,"Second, for Citibank, MAS will assess the supervisory actions to be taken against Citibank following the conclusions of the investigations in the 14 October incident."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00222,2023-11-06-T-004,222,Alvin Tan,"But if you take a step back and look at the whole financial system as a whole, MAS expects all financial institutions to implement the adequate risk controls. MAS will work with financial industry to incorporate the key learnings from this incident into all banks' risk management controls and include it into the MAS' future tech supervisory approach and also discuss it and it will be a key measure for the next financial sector business continuity exercise in 2024."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00223,2023-11-06-T-004,223,Alvin Tan,"But Mr Speaker, Sir, if you allow me to just take one step back and to answer the Member's question also."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00224,2023-11-06-T-004,224,Alvin Tan,We will accept that all forms of technology are not infallible. They will fail from time to time. They are not foolproof. They are not watertight. You see that happen in your smartphones; you see that in laptops; you also see that in your light bulbs.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00225,2023-11-06-T-004,225,Alvin Tan,Our approach to digitalisation is being digital first but not digital only.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00226,2023-11-06-T-004,226,Alvin Tan,"Recently, when I had a dinner, I was unable to pay using my credit card that was not available to me. However, then I had to use my PayNow, for example."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00227,2023-11-06-T-004,227,Alvin Tan,"So, on a whole level, if you look at it, the service providers, the systems need to be accountable, they need to do their part. Consumers themselves also have agencies. All of us also have agencies. We can make sure that we have contingency, the different ways to pay. But, ultimately, I think it is important that in the age of digitalisation both financial institutions as well as consumers – have to be aware that some people may not be adept at technology. And the banks and financial institutions and, in fact, companies, service providers must acknowledge that and must be able to provide other forms of payment approaches, so that others who are not so adept can still participate in the economy."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00228,2023-11-06-T-004,228,Speaker,Mr Yip Hong Weng.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00229,2023-11-06-T-004,229,Yip Hon Weng,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for his response. I note that MAS does not oversee external service providers like data centres. But I am heartened to note that the Government will study strengthening the security of data centres."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00230,2023-11-06-T-004,230,Yip Hon Weng,"My supplementary question is this  will MAS consider working with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and, perhaps, even the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) for a whole-of-Government approach to ensure that for data centres, there are build-in redundancy systems as well as robust plans to deter cyber attacks?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00231,2023-11-06-T-004,231,Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank Mr Yip for his supplementary questions. The short answer to that is yes."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00232,2023-11-06-T-004,232,Alvin Tan,"Please let me explain why MAS does not require banks to operate their own data centres. Because not all banks possess the relevant expertise and the skills to do so. Therefore, banks are given the option to tap on data centre operators' specialised know-how as well as the state-of-the-art data centre technologies. But, of course, as I mentioned earlier on, these things fail from time to time and, even if they have their exercises and their testing, some other parts of the system may fail. And, therefore, the lessons learnt will be incorporated into reviews and as well as exercises."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00233,2023-11-06-T-004,233,Alvin Tan,"To the Member's point about the whole-of-Government's approach to data centres, because it is not just confined to the financial services, the questions about the regulation of data centres have been addressed in response to Parliamentary Questions in this House. As we know, data centres serve multiple industries, not just the financial sector, MAS will, indeed, work with the relevant authorities on the Government's policy over data centre reliance."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00234,2023-11-06-T-004,234,Alvin Tan,"But let me also assure Members that although MAS does not directly regulate data centres, MAS expects all financial institutions to implement adequate risk controls to ensure data centre resilience such as conducting a threat and vulnerability risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses and the protection that they should establish to safeguard data centres against physical and environmental threats."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00235,2023-11-06-T-004,235,Alvin Tan,Financial institutions are also expected to conduct due diligence and exercise adequate oversight of outsourced data centre service providers. These expectations are spelt out in MAS' Technology Risk Management Guidelines and Outsourcing Guidelines.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00236,2023-11-06-T-004,236,Speaker,"I see three more Members wanting to ask supplementary questions and I am conscious that Question Time is coming to an end. So, to all three, I will allow it and, likewise, for Minister of State Tan, if you can all keep your questions and your answers short. Ms Jean See."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00237,2023-11-06-T-004,237,See Jinli Jean,"Yes. I thank the Minister of State. For the consumers who were affected, the assurance that consumers would want is reliability of service. So, I do understand that Minister of State mentioned about a review that the MAS will be taking. Could we understand what will be the steps that MAS is looking into, to ensure that consumers' voices are heard in the review and that their assurance is actually reflected in the metrics of the review?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00238,2023-11-06-T-004,238,Alvin Tan,"Sir, the short answer is, we will do so."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00239,2023-11-06-T-004,239,Speaker,Mr Don Wee.
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00240,2023-11-06-T-004,240,Don Wee,"Thank you, Speaker. Many average Singaporeans and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), especially the smaller merchants like hawkers do not have spare cash and maintain only one operating account with a particular Singaporean bank. Neither do they have the means to seek legal recourse against the bank for the loss of business opportunities as well as the inconvenience caused. So, my question to MAS is, how does MAS decide when to impose a mortarium on new business venture or to impose a higher regulatory capital or to impose a larger network of ATMs?"
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00241,2023-11-06-T-004,241,Alvin Tan,"Sir, I can understand the Member's concerns and I share those concerns as well. I mentioned that earlier on with regard to how we are and must be digital first but not digital only."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00242,2023-11-06-T-004,242,Alvin Tan,"To Ms Jean's point also, for customers who incurred late charges due to the outrage, DBS and Citibank will waive these charges."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00243,2023-11-06-T-004,243,Alvin Tan,"To Mr Don Wee's question, in fact, I had already explained that the point of restricting some of these activities, either acquisitions or reduce the scale-back of ATMs and branches and restricting the IT changes, these are all meant for this particular period for the bank, for DBS, to focus on remediating and fixing the issues that led to 14 October and, in fact, other issues that have related to the multiple disruptions over the course of a year."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00244,2023-11-06-T-004,244,Speaker,"Mr Leong Mun Wai, did you want to ask a question? No, okay."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00245,2023-11-06-T-004,245,Speaker,"Any other supplementary questions for the Minister of State? If not, Mr Lim Biow Chuan."
2023-11-06-T-004-S-00246,2023-11-06-T-004,246,Lim Biow Chuan,"Question No 55, Sir."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00247,2023-11-06-T-005,247,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how will the new on-board unit (OBU) for vehicles under the next generation Electronic Road Pricing system be effective in regulating traffic congestion on the roads if motorists are unaware of the exact costs of using certain roads; and (b) whether the payment options using the OBU will be aligned to the car park payment options for all car parks in Singapore.
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00248,2023-11-06-T-005,248,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Transport in relation to the introduction of ERP 2.0 (a) whether there have been any updated considerations and measures put in place (i) to balance the usage of data, in particular geo location data and (ii) on the usage of this data to fight crime, weighed against concerns about data security and privacy; and (b) if so, what are they."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00249,2023-11-06-T-005,249,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Transport (a) when does the Government intend to commence the implementation of distance-based charging under the new satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing system; (b) what are the factors under consideration to determine such a start date; and (c) whether the pricing mechanism for distance-based charging has been determined.
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00250,2023-11-06-T-005,250,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the comparative cost per unit of the In-Vehicle Unit of the current ERP system relative to the on-board unit of ERP 2.0; (b) what is the anticipated lifespan of the ERP 2.0 system before it becomes obsolete; and (c) whether LTA has assessed if the crucial functions of ERP 2.0 system can be replicated to a smartphone App to offer motorists a choice between exclusively utilising the App and installing the On-Boarding Unit.
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00251,2023-11-06-T-005,251,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 55 to 58 on today's Order Paper?"
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00252,2023-11-06-T-005,252,Speaker,Please go ahead.
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00253,2023-11-06-T-005,253,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you, Sir. The current Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system has served us well for 25 years, since 1998, in mitigating traffic congestion and keeping traffic smooth along key roads. However, it is reaching the end of its operational lifespan. Obsolete parts in the gantries as well as the existing in-vehicle unit (IU) would require customised production or the use of less reliable substitutes which could affect the effectiveness and reliability of the system. Running such an ageing system will not be cost effective."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00254,2023-11-06-T-005,254,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had assessed that it is less costly to replace the current ERP system with ERP 2.0 based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology, compared to extending the existing system. The new system allows LTA to be more agile in managing congestion. LTA will have valuable insights into our traffic conditions to make quicker interventions without the need to build costly physical gantries in land-scarce Singapore. ERP 2.0 is planned with long-term use in mind. The system architecture is based on open standards and a modular design, which will allow for future upgrades, that will help keep ERP 2.0 relevant and up-to-date."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00255,2023-11-06-T-005,255,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked how motorists would be aware of ERP charges with the new on-board unit (OBU). Under ERP 1.0, the charge is displayed on the IU when the vehicle crosses the gantry. During the transition from ERP 1.0 to ERP 2.0, when the new OBUs are being progressively installed, there will be no change to how motorists will be charged as charging will continue to be carried out by the gantries."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00256,2023-11-06-T-005,256,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"When the transition to ERP 2.0 is completed, charging will be carried out through GNSS as the physical gantries are progressively decommissioned. There will be signages which demarcate the points at which ERP will be charged and the OBU will provide an alert when the vehicle approaches an ERP-charging location and indicate the relevant charges. For motorists who choose not to install the OBU screen, this information will be made available through compatible mobile applications on smartphones. Information on ERP charged locations and ERP rates will also be announced and made available publicly on the OneMotoring website, which is similar to the current practice."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00257,2023-11-06-T-005,257,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan also asked whether the OBU will be aligned to the car park payment options. The short answer is yes. The OBU is designed to work with existing systems, including ERP and Electronic Parking System carparks. Motorists can continue to pay via valid Contactless e-Purse Application (CEPAS) cards such as EZ-Link Motoring Card, NETS Flashpay and NETS Motoring Card, but not cash cards, as these are being phased out."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00258,2023-11-06-T-005,258,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked on the comparative costs between the IU and OBU. For all eligible existing Singapore-registered vehicles, the OBU will be installed free of charge if completed within the two-month period stated in LTA's notification. It will also come with a five-year warranty. All new vehicles purchased from first quarter of next year will be fitted with the new OBUs. The costs of the new OBU are being finalised and will be announced in due course."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00259,2023-11-06-T-005,259,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Mr Louis Chua asked when does the Government intend to commence the implementation of distance-based charging. LTA has no immediate plans to introduce distance-based charging. Distance-based charging is a different approach for congestion management and any plans to implement it must take many factors into consideration.
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00260,2023-11-06-T-005,260,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ms He Ting Ru asked whether our considerations on data usage had been updated. Our reply to her on this issue in 2020 remains valid. To reiterate, there are strict safeguards in place to govern the collection, usage and storage of data. For instance, LTA will only use anonymised or aggregated data for traffic management and transport planning purposes. For vehicle-specific data, LTA will only use it for payment, charges and enforcement, such as against non-payment of ERP charges."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00261,2023-11-06-T-005,261,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"LTA also adheres to Government-wide standards for data security, including strict guidelines on data sharing with other Government agencies. Robust safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorised access. There are also criminal penalties for unauthorised disclosure and improper use of information. The Ministry of Home Affairs is replying to a separate Parliamentary Question on the use of ERP 2.0 data by the Singapore Police Force and intelligence agencies."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00262,2023-11-06-T-005,262,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked if LTA had access if the ERP 2.0 system could be wholly replaced using a smartphone. The OBU has three key functions. First, to identify the vehicle's location and communicate with the ERP system. Second, to process transactions in real time safely and securely. Third, to notify motorists on the ERP charge and other key traffic information."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00263,2023-11-06-T-005,263,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For the first function, the precision of smartphone location data can vary across different devices and increases the risk of erroneous charging. As a common and trusted standard issue device for all Singapore-registered vehicles, the OBU can better ensure reliability and performance and reduce significant downstream operational challenges, such as disputes regarding charging inaccuracies. It is also crucial to ensure that there are strict safeguards for data collection and storage. The OBU has been designed with robust security measures and tested extensively to ensure that it can handle real-time charging transactions and data securely. Data stored in the OBU cannot be directly accessed by motorists or external mobile applications and are designed to be tamper-proof, with a high level of security and encryption. The OBU is also designed for one-way communication to ensure better security. Therefore, while the OBU can broadcast data, it is not designed to receive data or instructions from an external mobile application."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00264,2023-11-06-T-005,264,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For the second function, to allow the smartphone to process the ERP transactions, motorists will have to start their mobile apps, key in their passcode or use biometric authentication to enable ERP charging each and every time they travel. This is inconvenient to motorists and some may inevitably forget to start their mobile apps for the ERP."
2023-11-06-T-005-S-00265,2023-11-06-T-005,265,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For the third function, LTA has taken on board earlier feedback and a mobile interface has since been developed, allowing motorists to opt out of installing the accompanying touchscreen of the OBU and use their smartphones for information display."

2023-11-06-T-010-S-00277,2023-11-06-T-010,277,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Manpower, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00278,2023-11-06-T-010,278,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system is a key pillar of Singapore's social security system which helps residents with a long-term commitment to Singapore, such as Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs), set aside savings for retirement, housing and healthcare needs. This three-in-one feature is unique to our CPF system."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00279,2023-11-06-T-010,279,Koh Poh Koon,We regularly review and update the CPF system and the Bill brings into legal effect the following changes.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00280,2023-11-06-T-010,280,Koh Poh Koon,"First, we had earlier announced in March this year that CPF accounts of non-residents will be closed from 1 April 2024. This Bill will give effect to this by ceasing non-residents' participation in CPF schemes. Second, the Bill introduces amendments to clarify and streamline the administration of CPF schemes for better service delivery to residents."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00281,2023-11-06-T-010,281,Koh Poh Koon,"The first set of amendments brings us closer to the CPF system's core objective of helping residents meet their retirement, housing and healthcare needs."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00282,2023-11-06-T-010,282,Koh Poh Koon,"As non-residents may choose to leave Singapore permanently at any point in time and are not expected to reside in Singapore in the long term, they are responsible for their own retirement and healthcare adequacy or home-ownership needs. We have gradually reduced the participation of non-residents in CPF schemes over the years. Non-residents have not been required to make CPF contributions since 1995. The option to make voluntary contributions was also removed in 2003. However, those who already had CPF accounts have been allowed to leave their past contributions in their accounts."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00283,2023-11-06-T-010,283,Koh Poh Koon,The amendments to completely cease the participation of non-residents in CPF schemes are the final steps that put the CPF system's core focus on supporting residents.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00284,2023-11-06-T-010,284,Koh Poh Koon,Non-residents should transfer their CPF savings to their bank accounts by 1 April 2024. CPF savings that are not transferred by this date will be transferred to the General Moneys of the Fund and will no longer earn the prevailing CPF interest.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00285,2023-11-06-T-010,285,Koh Poh Koon,"As a transitionary measure, in the first three years from 1 April 2024, non-residents' monies in the General Moneys of the Fund will earn interest based on the three-month average of the three local banks' savings account interest rate, which is currently at 0.05% per annum. This is because non-residents can transfer their monies to their bank account at any time."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00286,2023-11-06-T-010,286,Koh Poh Koon,"From 1 April 2027, three years after the change kicks in, non-residents' monies in the General Moneys of the Fund will no longer earn any interest. Non-residents are, therefore, encouraged to transfer these monies to their own bank accounts as soon as they can."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00287,2023-11-06-T-010,287,Koh Poh Koon,"Non-residents' participation in CPF schemes, such as CPF LIFE, will also cease from 1 April 2024."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00288,2023-11-06-T-010,288,Koh Poh Koon,"With these changes, the resources dedicated for the administration of CPF schemes will be better focused on supporting the needs of residents who have a long-term commitment to Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00289,2023-11-06-T-010,289,Koh Poh Koon,The second set of amendments clarifies as well as streamlines the administration of CPF schemes so as to improve service delivery.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00290,2023-11-06-T-010,290,Koh Poh Koon,"Today, under the CPF Act, members need to explicitly authorise CPF Board to allow any person to access their CPF information after their demise. For those who were authorised by the deceased member, they still have to write in to CPF Board to obtain the deceased member's information. For those who are not authorised by the deceased to access the deceased member's CPF information, they would have to take the additional step of obtaining a Court order to access the information. Such processes complicate the handling of a deceased member's CPF account and add additional stress to families in bereavement. Just this year alone, CPF Board has already received more than 3,000 requests to access deceased members' CPF information, often from their family members who are trying to settle the members' post-death matters."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00291,2023-11-06-T-010,291,Koh Poh Koon,"We will amend the CPF Act to make post-demise handling more convenient for the nominees and beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws of CPF members who have passed away. The amendments will allow nominees and beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws to access CPF information of deceased members, without members needing to explicitly authorise CPF Board to do so before they pass on. The CPF information that will be disclosed includes details, such as the deceased members' CPF balances, names of all the nominees and the proportion of CPF monies that the nominees will receive. It will also include details of the CPF schemes which the deceased members had participated in."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00292,2023-11-06-T-010,292,Koh Poh Koon,"This is aligned to industry practices for wills and intestate distribution of assets by the Public Trustee where, generally, all beneficiaries are able to obtain information on the portion of the estate or assets each beneficiary will have."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00293,2023-11-06-T-010,293,Koh Poh Koon,Being able to access the deceased members' CPF information will also provide transparency to the nominees and beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws that the deceased members' CPF monies have been fully accounted for and disbursed accordingly.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00294,2023-11-06-T-010,294,Koh Poh Koon,The amendments will also clarify that CPF Board can process CPF transactions on or after a member's death.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00295,2023-11-06-T-010,295,Koh Poh Koon,"Today, under the CPF Act, CPF Board should, generally, process CPF-related transactions up to the date of death of a member. The amendments will make clear that CPF Board is empowered to process certain transactions on or after the date of death of the member. These transactions typically arise or follow from obligations preceding the death of the member. They include inflows to the CPF accounts, such as refund of CareShield Life premiums to the member's MediSave account after death; and outflows from the CPF accounts, such as refunds to employers, if there were excess CPF contributions made."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00296,2023-11-06-T-010,296,Koh Poh Koon,"Lastly, we will amend the CPF Act to allow CPF Board to have greater flexibility determining the form of the Notice to Attend Court for greater ease of administration and adopt more convenient and efficient modes of sending documents."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00297,2023-11-06-T-010,297,Koh Poh Koon,"Today, the Act requires CPF Board to prescribe the form of the Notice to Attend Court in subsidiary legislation. With the amendments, CPF Board can make changes to the notice without having to amend subsidiary legislation. This is aligned with legislation governing other public sector agencies and allows for greater ease of administration when changes to the notice are required. CPF Board will publish a sample copy of the Notice to Attend Court on CPF Board's website so that members of the public can easily access and verify the authenticity and legitimacy of any notice received."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00298,2023-11-06-T-010,298,Koh Poh Koon,"The amendments will also allow CPF Board to serve certain documents through an electronic service platform instead of in hardcopy, as they are required to do so today. This means greater convenience for CPF members, employers and other persons as they will be able to access more documents from CPF Board electronically."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00299,2023-11-06-T-010,299,Koh Poh Koon,"For a start, selected hardcopy documents, notifications, such as the Notice of Contributions issued by CPF Board to self-employed persons, will be served electronically. Self-employed persons will still have the option to receive a hardcopy notice, by simply going to the CPF website to indicate their preference."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00300,2023-11-06-T-010,300,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, this sums up the administrative amendments to the CPF Act."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00301,2023-11-06-T-010,301,Koh Poh Koon,"Allow me to conclude. The CPF Amendment Bill will effect the cessation of non-residents' participation in CPF schemes. This will allow us to focus the CPF system on supporting the needs of residents who have a long-term commitment to Singapore. It also clarifies and streamlines the administration of CPF schemes, such as by aligning with industry practices, to benefit residents and provide them with greater convenience. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move."

2023-11-06-T-010-S-00303,2023-11-06-T-010,303,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00304,2023-11-06-T-010,304,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the key amendments in this Bill is to limit CPF schemes to SCs and PRs only. Following the amendment, foreigners who currently have CPF accounts will either have to withdraw all CPF monies standing to their credit or have their monies transferred to the General Moneys of the CPF Fund which would not bear interest on or after 1 April 2024."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00305,2023-11-06-T-010,305,Saktiandi Supaat,"How many such accounts will be affected and what percentage of all CPF accounts do they constitute? Is there any particular demographic of workers that is especially affected by this change? As these workers will be entitled to withdraw all existing monies once they lose their right to participate in the CPF scheme, are we doing anything special to brace ourselves for the expected rate of outflow of monies from the system?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00306,2023-11-06-T-010,306,Saktiandi Supaat,"While it is understandable that we want to ring-fence the benefits of the CPF system to Singaporeans only, I am sure there were also good reasons why we allowed foreigners working here to participate in the CPF scheme previously. Can the Government share how those considerations have changed today?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00307,2023-11-06-T-010,307,Saktiandi Supaat,"One reason that immediately comes to my mind is to ensure the relative competitiveness and employability of Singaporeans. By disapplying the CPF system to foreigners working here, would that cause businesses and employers to turn away from Singaporeans to foreign workers since they do not have to pay additional CPF contributions for the foreign workers?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00308,2023-11-06-T-010,308,Saktiandi Supaat,"As the CPF system becomes inapplicable to non-PR foreigners, related schemes, such as the Lifelong Income Scheme and the Home Protection Insurance Scheme, will naturally have to be terminated for such individuals. I am just curious why the Bill expressly provides that the time prescribed for terminating such schemes ""may differ for different classes of members"". Perhaps the Minister can provide some clarification on what the provision seeks to address."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00309,2023-11-06-T-010,309,Saktiandi Supaat,"Is the move to ring-fence the benefits of CPF to Singaporeans a sign that we will be seeing significant changes to the system? When many Members, including me, queried the relevance of the CPF interest rate pegs amidst soaring inflation and global interest rates, Minister Tan See Leng stated during the Committee of Supply 2023 that the Ministry is watching this interest rate environment very closely to ensure that the CPF interest rate pegs remain relevant in the prevailing operating environment. Are we about to see an increase in the 2.5% and 4% pegs for the CPF Ordinary Account (OA) and other accounts respectively?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00310,2023-11-06-T-010,310,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am glad that we are taking steps to make it even easier for a CPF member's monies to be disbursed to beneficiaries upon the member's death. When we last debated amendments to the CPF Act in 2021, this House was informed of how CPF Board already reaches out to nominees once it is notified of a member's death and it disburses the monies within a month."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00311,2023-11-06-T-010,311,Saktiandi Supaat,The Bill now introduces a power for the CPF Board to disclose certain information about the deceased CPF member to his or her nominees or any persons who would be the member's beneficiaries if no nomination was made. This would enable nominees and beneficiaries to come forward and withdraw the member's leftover CPF monies even more quickly.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00312,2023-11-06-T-010,312,Saktiandi Supaat,"Since 2021, what percentage of deceased members' accounts was not disbursed and emptied within a month of the member's death being notified to CPF Board? And what percentage of deceased members' accounts still contained unclaimed CPF monies six months after CPF Board is notified of the member's death, such that the monies had to be transferred out into the general CPF fund and no further interest is payable on such monies?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00313,2023-11-06-T-010,313,Saktiandi Supaat,"Before these amendments, what percentage of CPF members gave their consent to the CPF Board to disclose information after death, when making their nominations of the persons entitled to receive their CPF monies upon their death?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00314,2023-11-06-T-010,314,Saktiandi Supaat,"Under the new section 59(11), the information which CPF Board may disclose without consent includes the deceased member's CPF accounts, any nomination made by the member and ""any other information as may be prescribed in regulations"". So, the question I have is  will the prescribed information be broader than the scope of information that a member can presently consent to the CPF Board's disclosure? Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the clarifications sought, I support the Bill."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00315,2023-11-06-T-010,315,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00316,2023-11-06-T-010,316,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the main objectives of this Bill being debated today is to amend the CPF Act 1953, to limit CPF schemes to SCs and PRs only. This is the culmination of changes to CPF that began almost 30 years ago. Prior to August 1995, some categories of foreign workers, most notably, Employment Pass (EP) holders, had to make CPF contributions in line with the prevailing rates of Singaporeans and PRs. Similarly, their employers also had to make CPF contributions for these foreign workers. However, after 1 August 1995, all foreigners were exempted from CPF contributions. At that time, the Ministry of Labour, which is now the Ministry of Manpower, stated that the only reason for the change was to streamline the CPF rule for all foreign workers. But even in 1995, there was already concern that exempting foreign workers, especially EP holders, from CPF contributions would have negative impacts on Singaporean workers, especially the middle-ranking PMETs, because employers would benefit from lower wage cost when they employ new foreign staff."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00317,2023-11-06-T-010,317,Leong Mun Wai,"An article in The Straits Times on 15 July 1995 noted that Singaporean workers would become less competitive against foreigners if employers do not make up for all or some of the CPF forgone by the foreign worker, especially if the foreigner was here on local terms. Even the then Menteri Besar of Johor, Mr Abdul Ghani bin Othman expressed his concern that the rule change would make Singapore a more attractive place to work for Malaysians, especially those from Johor."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00318,2023-11-06-T-010,318,Leong Mun Wai,"Were these concerns without basis? We can now examine this with the benefit of the experience of the last 30 years. Since the rule change in 1995, the number of EP holders in Singapore has increased substantially. In the mid-1990s, there were only 50,000 EP holders in Singapore, accounting for less than 3% of the labour force at that time. Today, as of June 2023, there are almost 200,000 EP holders in Singapore, accounting for close to 6% of the labour force. I am not suggesting that the exemption of EP holders from CPF contributions has been the only reason driving the increase in the number and proportion of EP holders among the workforce in Singapore. But there is no doubt that this policy does make our local professionals less competitive against foreign professionals. A company can hire a foreign professional holding an EP at a monthly salary of $5,000. Same as Singaporeans. But the employer would have to pay an extra $850 in CPF contributions for the Singaporean worker. The Singaporean's wage bill for the employer is $5,850, but the Singaporean only gets to take home $4,000. As for the EP holder, the employer's wage bill remains as $5,000 and the EP holder gets to take home the whole $5,000. It is a win-win situation for both the employer and the EP."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00319,2023-11-06-T-010,319,Leong Mun Wai,"It should be no wonder that the employers in Singapore have become more reliant on EP holders since the rules were changed almost 30 years ago. The Minister for Manpower has denied that several times in this House in response to my questioning, quoting other costs that the employers have to bear. However, the fact remains that the change of the law in 1995 has given an advantage to employers who employ foreign workers and PMETs. That advantage became a menace to Singaporean workers after the Government opened up the local job market to foreigners since the early 2000s. We are not calling for a return to the old days, where EP holders had to make CPF contributions, in line with Singaporean workers. However, we believe that, even until today, not enough has been done to mitigate the negative impacts caused by this policy, which has helped to make Singaporean workers less competitive against foreign workers and depress the wages of Singaporean workers. What can be done to mitigate these negative impacts?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00320,2023-11-06-T-010,320,Leong Mun Wai,PSP would like to put forth two suggestions.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00321,2023-11-06-T-010,321,Leong Mun Wai,"Firstly, we need to level the playing field for Singaporean workers by imposing a $1,200 monthly levy on all EP holders immediately. We have made this call in this House before, during the Budget debates in 2021 and 2023. In March, the Minister said that I keep harping on this thing about imposing a levy. But I am going to repeat this again. This levy will take up a smaller portion of the high salaries of the true foreign talents and differentiate them from lower-wage foreign professionals who are being used as low-cost labour and depressing the wages of Singapore professionals. This way, we will be able to get the best, highest quality talent to come to Singapore from anywhere in the world."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00322,2023-11-06-T-010,322,Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, we need to ensure that Singaporeans earn higher returns on their CPF balances to compensate for the lower wages they earn as a result of the expansion of the foreign PMET intake in the last two decades. In a written answer to my colleague Ms Hazel Poa's question in September, Minister Tan See Leng revealed that the overall average CPF interest rate, including extra interest, across the different types of CPF accounts and balances, from 2018 to 2022, is close to 4% per annum, which means it is less than 4% per annum. As CPF balances are long-term retirement funds kept with CPF Board for 30 to 40 years, there is room for the returns on CPF accounts to be higher. Singaporeans currently have limited options to increase the returns on their CPF savings. They can only leave the money in their accounts and earn the fixed interest rates given by the Government, or invest savings above a threshold in the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). Although the experience of the CPFIS, which is essentially a self-managed investment account is not encouraging, perhaps due to limited investor knowledge and lack of investment opportunities in the local capital markets, we should allow Singaporeans to put more of their CPF savings with professional managers."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00323,2023-11-06-T-010,323,Leong Mun Wai,"In 2016, the CPF Advisory Board had recommended that a new lifetime retirement investment scheme, which is managed by professionals, be introduced. Under this scheme, CPF members will be allowed to invest some of their CPF savings in simple-to-understand, low-fee, well-diversified life-cycle investment products."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00324,2023-11-06-T-010,324,Leong Mun Wai,"Such products will be passively managed and carefully selected by the CPF Board. The funds would most likely invest in higher-risk, higher-return assets such as equities when the CPF member is younger and lower-risk, lower-return assets such as bonds when they are closer to their retirement age."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00325,2023-11-06-T-010,325,Leong Mun Wai,"Similar funds are offered by the Australian superannuation scheme or 401K scheme in America, which some Singaporeans may already be familiar with. This will be an additional option for most CPF members which may earn higher returns on their investable CPF savings."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00326,2023-11-06-T-010,326,Leong Mun Wai,"According to statistics published by the US Department of Labor, 401K plans return about 6% to 10% per annum when we assess the rate of return over a five-year period."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00327,2023-11-06-T-010,327,Leong Mun Wai,"While the returns each year will be much more volatile than a fixed interest rate from CPF, CPF members should be able to earn a higher return through the lifetime retirement investment scheme over 30 or 40 years."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00328,2023-11-06-T-010,328,Leong Mun Wai,"On top of this, the lifetime retirement investment scheme can help grow our local fund management industry and preventing Singaporeans from being over-invested in property."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00329,2023-11-06-T-010,329,Leong Mun Wai,"The Government had accepted the recommendation to set up the Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme in 2016. However, it has still not yet been implemented. Why is this the case?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00330,2023-11-06-T-010,330,Leong Mun Wai,"The Government should not stay silent on this issue and set up the Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme so that Singaporeans have the option to increase the returns on their Ordinary Account and Special Account savings by investing them in low-fee, passively managed investment products."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00331,2023-11-06-T-010,331,Leong Mun Wai,"If the Government is not prepared to allow Singaporeans to do this, then it should increase the interest rates that it pays to CPF members. This is possible because GIC returns more than 4% a year."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00332,2023-11-06-T-010,332,Leong Mun Wai,The Government should share with Singaporeans more of the differential between what it pays Singaporeans in CPF interest and what it earns from GIC in investment returns. This will go a long way in improving the retirement adequacy of Singaporeans whose wages have been depressed by the influx of lower-wage foreign workers over the last few decades.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00333,2023-11-06-T-010,333,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, notwithstanding what I have said, I support the Bill. For country, for people."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00334,2023-11-06-T-010,334,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00335,2023-11-06-T-010,335,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, this Bill updates the CPF rules to limit the CPF scheme to only SCs and PRs. The Bill also updates rules relating to the death of a CPF member."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00336,2023-11-06-T-010,336,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,CPF is one of Singapore's unique features. CPF plays an important role in our social stability by helping Singaporeans have a strong retirement nest egg set aside to age gracefully. I support this Bill as it represents a continued focus on this purpose.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00337,2023-11-06-T-010,337,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have three points of clarification to raise.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00338,2023-11-06-T-010,338,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My first clarification is how we ensure that new citizens or PRs will have sufficient amounts set aside for their retirement.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00339,2023-11-06-T-010,339,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The changes in this Bill reinforce that CPF is meant for the retirement needs of Singaporeans and PRs. However, Singapore remains an open economy. There are people who continue to take up citizenship or PR status. At the point that they take up citizenship or PR status, they may not have any CPF savings. Depending on their age, they may not have the time to build up their retirement reserves. If new citizens and PRs do not have sufficient retirement reserves, they too will have to rely on public infrastructure in their retirement years. How does the Government ensure that any new citizens and PRs have sufficient savings to be self-reliant in their retirement years?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00340,2023-11-06-T-010,340,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second clarification is on the change of timing when making computations for deceased members. The Bill changes this from the actual time of death to the time CPF is notified. Can the Minister elaborate what practical effect these changes will have for Singaporeans?
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00341,2023-11-06-T-010,341,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,The CPF website states that there is no need for Singaporeans to notify the CPF Board. Can Singaporeans assume that notifications are made automatically to the CPF Board on the same day a death is reported? Is there any risk that this would adversely affect the accounts of a deceased member or payouts to their nominees?
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00342,2023-11-06-T-010,342,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,CPF can appear complex to Singaporeans and making sure the rules are clear to Singaporeans will give them greater confidence in the system.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00343,2023-11-06-T-010,343,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My third and final clarification is on the adjustment to CPF interest rates. We are in an environment of rising interest rates. Many Singaporeans save in and even voluntarily top up their CPF, knowing it is a safe vehicle for their retirement savings with an attractive interest rate."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00344,2023-11-06-T-010,344,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"However, this year we saw the pegged rate for the Special and MediSave accounts go above the floor rate. Various savings and investment products are also advertising rates above the Ordinary Account interest rate. Singaporeans may thus want to chase higher interest rates and through riskier products. Can the Minister elaborate on the Government's approach to adjusting the interest rate? Will the rates be reviewed in the near future so that our ageing population can have a larger retirement nest egg?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00345,2023-11-06-T-010,345,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00346,2023-11-06-T-010,346,Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00347,2023-11-06-T-010,347,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments in the CPF Bill enhance our CPF system in two key aspects – prioritising Singaporean Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs) and streamlining the administration of CPF schemes for improved service delivery. I seek clarification on a few points."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00348,2023-11-06-T-010,348,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek clarification on the policy intent behind the closure of CPF accounts for non-SC/PR individuals."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00349,2023-11-06-T-010,349,Yip Hon Weng,"When was the requirement for CPF contributions by non-SC/PR members introduced? Despite the prohibition on contributions from foreigners since 2003, about 300,000 non-SC/PR individuals remain in the CPF system. Among them are those who received contributions or made voluntary contributions since 2003 as well as former SC/PRs who relinquished their citizenship or permanent residency."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00350,2023-11-06-T-010,350,Yip Hon Weng,Were active steps taken to encourage SC/PRs to close their accounts over the years? How much does CPF expect to pay out when these accounts are closed and how much of these payments are accrued interest? Can CPF share projections regarding the number of individuals expected to transition to the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)?
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00351,2023-11-06-T-010,351,Yip Hon Weng,"Regarding the impact of individuals transitioning to the SRS, SRS contributions are entitled to income tax relief. However, withdrawals are subject to income tax. Does this policy align with our broader economic goals? Do the economic benefits of this policy, such as potential tax revenues and investment funds, outweigh the incentives provided to foreigners to grow their retirement accounts in Singapore?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00352,2023-11-06-T-010,352,Yip Hon Weng,These questions reflect the concerns and curiosity of some Singaporeans who may perceive the policy as the Government simply facilitating the growth of retirement funds for foreigners.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00353,2023-11-06-T-010,353,Yip Hon Weng,Can the Government share more about the policy considerations on this matter? Will individuals in the process of applying for SC/PR status be allowed to retain their CPF accounts during this period or are they required to close their accounts and later re-establish them upon attaining SC/PR status?
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00354,2023-11-06-T-010,354,Yip Hon Weng,"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have queries on the policy amendments on the disclosure of deceased members' CPF information. I would like to seek clarification on whether disclosure will be limited to one instance or if all next of kin, beneficiaries or nominees will be entitled to request such information."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00355,2023-11-06-T-010,355,Yip Hon Weng,"What mechanisms will be in place to ensure that the requestors are likely beneficiaries when a member passes away without a will or Court order? Moreover, how does the Board determine that such information will be accessed by individuals whom the deceased member did not intend to be beneficiaries?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00356,2023-11-06-T-010,356,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the changes in this Bill to focus the CPF system on Singaporeans and PRs are the right approach. The CPF system was set up as a compulsory savings plan for working Singaporeans and PRs primarily to fund their retirement, healthcare, education and housing needs. We should ensure that the system remains focused on its target beneficiaries. Additionally, we should strive for efficiency and resident-centric administration of CPF schemes for better service delivery. I support the Bill."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00357,2023-11-06-T-010,357,Speaker,Mr Don Wee.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00358,2023-11-06-T-010,358,Don Wee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the proposed amendments to limit the CPF system to SCs and PRs. Much work and resources are required to administer CPF accounts and to pay interests on the funds. It is timely to close the roughly 300,000 accounts set up by non-SC/PRs from more than 20 years ago, before 2003."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00359,2023-11-06-T-010,359,Don Wee,"May I ask the Minister what is the total amount in these accounts? How much operational savings is expected as a result of these amendments? With the closure of these accounts, the remaining savings will cease to earn the prevailing CPF interest rates. Would CPF consider to stop paying any interest at all? How will CPF Board return the funds to account holders whose bank accounts are closed? Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00360,2023-11-06-T-010,360,Don Wee,"(In Mandarin)  What is the deadline for the withdrawal of the monies? In the event of the death of account holders, what is the deadline for the family members or beneficiaries to claim the monies?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00361,2023-11-06-T-010,361,Don Wee,"What happens if the account holder does not have any beneficiary in Singapore? What will CPF do with the unclaimed amount? Can the money, for example, be included as part of the Ministry of Manpower's budget and be used for purposes, such as helping SMEs to train and develop their Singaporean workers?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00362,2023-11-06-T-010,362,Don Wee,"If both the account holder and the spouse had passed on and the account owner had few children, will all their children be classified as the next-of-kin and receive the same amounts?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00363,2023-11-06-T-010,363,Don Wee,"Regarding the amendments to disclose deceased members' CPF information to nominees and beneficiaries without the need to obtain a Court order, what happens if the next-of-kin is neither a nominee nor beneficiary? Can he still get the deceased's CPF information?"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00364,2023-11-06-T-010,364,Don Wee,(In English)  I support the Bill.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00365,2023-11-06-T-010,365,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Koh.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00366,2023-11-06-T-010,366,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, let me begin by thanking Members for their support for the CPF (Amendment) Bill."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00367,2023-11-06-T-010,367,Koh Poh Koon,Let me first start by addressing questions related to the first set of amendments to cease participation of non-residents such as non-SC/PRs in CPF schemes.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00368,2023-11-06-T-010,368,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether there are new considerations that led to these changes. Actually, we have been gradually moving towards ceasing the participation of non-residents in the CPF system across the years. We have removed mandatory CPF contributions for non-residents since 1995 and disallowed voluntary CPF contributions by non-residents since 2003."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00369,2023-11-06-T-010,369,Koh Poh Koon,"Hence, the amendments in this Bill are the final steps to ensure that the CPF system is focused on the core objective of supporting the retirement, housing and healthcare needs of residents here in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00370,2023-11-06-T-010,370,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked whether ceasing the participation of foreign workers in the CPF system will cause businesses and employers to turn away from Singaporeans since employers do not have to pay additional CPF contributions for foreign workers. Mr Leong Mun Wai is similarly concerned about Singaporean workers being less competitive than foreign workers.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00371,2023-11-06-T-010,371,Koh Poh Koon,Let me explain that Qualifying Salaries for Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders are in place as a lever to ensure that non-residents are not under-cutting wages of residents.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00372,2023-11-06-T-010,372,Koh Poh Koon,"Qualifying Salaries are benchmarked against local wages, inclusive of employer CPF contributions. The EP and S Pass Qualifying Salaries are benchmarked to the top one-third of local professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) and associate professionals and technicians (APTs) respectively."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00373,2023-11-06-T-010,373,Koh Poh Koon,"Based on the way that we benchmark the wages of EP and S Pass holders, there is no wage-cost advantage for employers to hire foreign professionals. That is one area that Mr Leong has raised that I would like to dispel."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00374,2023-11-06-T-010,374,Koh Poh Koon,"And this has been previously addressed in various Parliamentary Questions (PQs). Mr Leong's characterisation of EP salaries being lower than local PMETs is also inaccurate as we have been raising it regularly and have now benchmarked it to the top one-third of local PMET wages. In fact, the $5,000 qualifying salary that Mr Leong cited is for a young EP – a young EP holder at the age of 23, just joining the workforce."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00375,2023-11-06-T-010,375,Koh Poh Koon,"This increases progressively with age to $10,500 a month at age 45 and above. And for the financial services sector, it is even higher, to take into account the consideration that there are higher salary norms in these other sectors."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00376,2023-11-06-T-010,376,Koh Poh Koon,"The rest of Mr Leong's obtuse and illogical argument to link this to CPF returns is outside the scope of this Bill and it is quite irrelevant to this discussion. So, I will not attempt to do mental gymnastics with Members here in this House."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00377,2023-11-06-T-010,377,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked how many non-resident accounts will be affected and whether we are going to do anything to prepare for the expected outflow of monies from the CPF system. Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Don Wee also asked about the size of CPF balances being transferred out of the CPF system.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00378,2023-11-06-T-010,378,Koh Poh Koon,"There are approximately 300,000 non-residents who will cease participation in the CPF schemes. The majority of these non-residents have low CPF balances, with approximately 70% of them having less than S$5,000 in their CPF accounts. The median CPF balance is $1,500. Non-resident CPF balance is, in fact, only about 1% of all CPF balances. So, the outflow of non-resident CPF balances will not pose liquidity issues."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00379,2023-11-06-T-010,379,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Don Wee asked how much operational savings are expected as a result of these amendments. To give Members some sense of the additional operational load on CPF Board to serve non-residents, let me explain that CPF Board has separate manual processes to manage service requests from non-residents, such as undertaking additional steps to verify their identity, as these non-residents do not have access to Singpass. Hence, ceasing the participation of non-residents in CPF will result in more efficiency for CPF Board."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00380,2023-11-06-T-010,380,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked why the timeline to cease non-residents' participation in CPF schemes may differ for different groups of members. There are broadly two different groups of members. The first are existing non-residents who have already left Singapore or have not been working for some time here in Singapore. The second are members who become non-residents after 1 April 2024.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00381,2023-11-06-T-010,381,Koh Poh Koon,"For existing non-residents who are already known to us, we are able to process the accounts ahead of time so that their participation in CPF schemes will cease starting from 1 April 2024. However, for current residents who become non-residents only after 1 April 2024, we can only cease their participation in CPF schemes from the date that they renounce their Singapore Citizenship or their Permanent Residency. Hence, some time is required to wind up their participation in CPF schemes, depending on the specific circumstances."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00382,2023-11-06-T-010,382,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether those in the process of applying for Singapore Citizenship or Permanent Residency can be allowed to continue participating in CPF schemes.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00383,2023-11-06-T-010,383,Koh Poh Koon,"Those who already hold Permanent Residency and are applying for Singapore Citizenship will continue to participate in CPF schemes. For non-residents who are applying for Permanent Residency, the general application processing time is about six months and some applications may take longer to process. Hence, for those who still hold non-resident status as of 1 April 2024, their participation in CPF schemes will cease."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00384,2023-11-06-T-010,384,Koh Poh Koon,"Nonetheless, once they are granted Permanent Residency, they will then be part of the CPF system. CPF Board had also announced in March this year how non-residents' participation in CPF schemes will cease, which should give ample lead time for the transition of these members."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00385,2023-11-06-T-010,385,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Don Wee also asked how CPF Board will return the CPF balances to account holders whose bank accounts are closed. Non-residents can choose to transfer their CPF monies to their local or overseas bank accounts or via cheques.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00386,2023-11-06-T-010,386,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Don Wee also asked about the deadline for the transfer of monies by the member, or, if they are deceased, by their beneficiaries who may not be in Singapore. He also asked what CPF Board would do with the unclaimed monies and whether it could be used, for example, as part of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s budget."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00387,2023-11-06-T-010,387,Koh Poh Koon,"There is no deadline for non-residents to transfer their CPF monies. They can do so at any time. If non-residents have passed on, there is also no deadline for their nominees or beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws to claim the monies. These unclaimed monies will continue to be held for the non-residents in the General Money of the Fund. And while I would like to have additional budget for MOM's needs, we cannot use this money as part of MOM's operating budget or, for that matter, for any other purposes."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00388,2023-11-06-T-010,388,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Louis Ng asked if new citizens and PRs will have sufficient savings to be self-reliant. In general, new citizens and PRs are required to either be economically active or have the means to support themselves through employment or family support. CPF savings are not their only means to attain retirement adequacy. And, in fact, many Singaporeans and PRs also tap on their savings and family support to meet their own retirement needs."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00389,2023-11-06-T-010,389,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether there are projections regarding the number of non-residents expected to sign up for the Supplementary Retirement Scheme, also known as SRS, and whether the Government is, in fact, facilitating the growth of retirement funds of non-residents by providing them tax relief through SRS."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00390,2023-11-06-T-010,390,Koh Poh Koon,The Member has linked SRS to CPF. Let me clarify this very common misconception.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00391,2023-11-06-T-010,391,Koh Poh Koon,"SRS is operated by the private sector, where participation is voluntary and contributions are made through cash, not CPF monies. Contributions to SRS are separate from the CPF scheme and SRS is a mechanism for anyone who wishes to save money for retirement. So, SRS members are able to use savings in their SRS account to invest in commercial investment products in the market and the investment returns from these commercial products can complement CPF to support their retirement. But it is, in fact, quite a separate thing from CPF."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00392,2023-11-06-T-010,392,Koh Poh Koon,"The only thing they have in common, is that they help to add to the retirement adequacy needs of the individual. So, as SRS is voluntary, we are not able to predict the number of sign-ups."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00393,2023-11-06-T-010,393,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Leong Mun Wai asked about whether the interest rates and returns of CPF accounts will increase in the future. This is not relevant to today's CPF (Amendment) Bill, but nonetheless, let me respond briefly by saying that the Ordinary, Special and MediSave Account interest rates are reviewed quarterly while the Retirement Account interest rate is reviewed annually, according to the pegged rates."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00394,2023-11-06-T-010,394,Koh Poh Koon,"Despite the low interest rate environment in the last decade since the global financial crisis, the Government paid generous CPF interest rates due to the floor rates of 4% for the Special, MediSave and Retirement Accounts and 2.5% for the Ordinary Account. When the pegged rates exceed the floor rates, members will correspondingly earn the higher interest rates on their CPF savings. So, we will continue to review the CPF interest rates to ensure that returns remain relevant while taking into consideration the longer-term outlook."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00395,2023-11-06-T-010,395,Koh Poh Koon,"Let me move on to clarifications regarding the second set of amendments to streamline the administration of CPF schemes for better service delivery. On aligning disclosure practices upon a member's death to industry practices, Members have asked questions about who will receive the deceased member's CPF information and what information will be disclosed. Some Members have also asked questions on the disbursement of CPF monies after a member's death."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00396,2023-11-06-T-010,396,Koh Poh Koon,"On who will receive the deceased member's CPF information, Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether the disclosure of deceased member's information is limited to one person or all of the next-of-kin, beneficiaries and nominees. Mr Don Wee also asked whether the information would be disclosed to a next-of-kin who is neither a nominee nor a beneficiary under the relevant intestacy laws."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00397,2023-11-06-T-010,397,Koh Poh Koon,"All nominees and the deceased's beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws will be allowed to access the deceased member's CPF information. To be clear, if a family relation is not considered a next-of-kin under the relevant intestacy laws, they will not be allowed access to the deceased member's CPF information."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00398,2023-11-06-T-010,398,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked what percentage of CPF members gave consent to CPF Board to disclose information after death when making their nominations of the persons entitled to receive their CPF monies upon their death. Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked whether the amendments entail information being accessed by those not intended by the deceased member.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00399,2023-11-06-T-010,399,Koh Poh Koon,"Today, nine in 10 members who make nominations have already authorised all their nominees to access their CPF information upon the members' demise. Hence, for the vast majority of those members today, the amendments are, in fact, aligned with their intentions."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00400,2023-11-06-T-010,400,Koh Poh Koon,Being able to access the deceased member's CPF information and nomination details without requiring explicit authorisation by deceased members is aligned to industry practice for wills and intestate distribution of assets by the Public Trustee. It is intended to provide convenience to settle deceased member's post-demise matters. It also ensures transparency so that all nominees and beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws are assured that the deceased members' CPF monies have been fully accounted for.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00401,2023-11-06-T-010,401,Koh Poh Koon,"On what information will be disclosed, Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether the information that nominees and beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws can access is broader in scope than what authorised members can access today."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00402,2023-11-06-T-010,402,Koh Poh Koon,"In general, only details that will help nominees or beneficiaries under relevant intestacy laws settle the deceased member's post-demise matters will be disclosed. This will include details of the deceased's participation in CPF schemes, but exclude details of the relationships between nominee and the deceased, as well as information on the deceased's witnesses to the nomination."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00403,2023-11-06-T-010,403,Koh Poh Koon,"On the disbursement of CPF monies after a member's death, Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked what percentage of deceased members' CPF monies was not disbursed within a month and remained unclaimed six months after the notification of death to CPF Board."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00404,2023-11-06-T-010,404,Koh Poh Koon,"From 2021 to 2023, on average, around 70% of deceased members' CPF monies were disbursed by CPF Board or transferred to the Public Trustee for disbursement within five weeks upon notification of death. For the same period, on average, only 5% of nominated monies remained unclaimed six months after notification of death."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00405,2023-11-06-T-010,405,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Don Wee asked whether in the event that the member and their spouse have passed on, would the children from the marriage be considered as next-of-kin and receive the same amount of CPF monies. Now, where the deceased member did not make a nomination for his CPF monies, the member's children would be considered next-of-kin and receive equal portions based on the distribution rules under the Intestate Succession Act. However, if there is a valid nomination, it will go to the surviving nominees, which may or may not be the children, depending on the nomination."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00406,2023-11-06-T-010,406,Koh Poh Koon,"On allowing transactions to continue after a member's death, Mr Louis Ng asked what practical effect these amendments will have for Singaporeans. As explained in my opening speech, the amendments seek to clarify the Board's powers to process the necessary transactions after a member's date of death. Singaporeans will not experience any changes in the computation of the CPF balances to be paid out to the nominees and beneficiaries under the relevant intestacy laws."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00407,2023-11-06-T-010,407,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, in closing, I would again like to express my appreciation to Members of the House who have expressed their support for the Bill. The Bill will allow us to continue to focus the CPF system on supporting residents' retirement, housing and healthcare needs. Residents will also benefit from the streamlined administration of CPF schemes. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00408,2023-11-06-T-010,408,Speaker,Do Members have any clarifications for the Senior Minister of State? Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00409,2023-11-06-T-010,409,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, I would like to clarify with the Senior Minister of State on the impact of the CPF contribution on the Singaporean workers vis-à-vis the EP."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00410,2023-11-06-T-010,410,Leong Mun Wai,"I have discussed or debated about this several times with the Minister and also the Senior Minister of State, over the course of the last few years in this House. And the reasons that the Minister and the Senior Minister of State have given, are the same as what he had said today – that that disadvantage for the Singaporean workers has been mitigated through adjusting the minimum Qualifying Salary."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00411,2023-11-06-T-010,411,Leong Mun Wai,"But what I would like to clarify and like to say is that one, there are two things about the minimum Qualifying Salary. One is that the Minister and the Senior Minister of State has said that the minimum Qualifying Salary will be adjusted according to the age of the EP. But that adjustment is not totally transparent to the public or to all of us. We need more information as to how they adjust that and then that would negate the negative impact on Singaporeans."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00412,2023-11-06-T-010,412,Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, the minimum Qualifying Salary has been adjusted over the years. However, I think I would also like to point out that it is only in recent years that a minimum Qualifying Salary has been adjusted upwards many times. For the longest time, since 2000, when we opened the flood gates for foreign workers, the minimum Qualifying Salaries has actually remained at very low levels. In fact, I think until December 2020, the minimum Qualifying Salary was only $3,900. I cannot remember all —"
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00413,2023-11-06-T-010,413,Speaker,"Mr Leong, your clarification please."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00414,2023-11-06-T-010,414,Leong Mun Wai,"So, I would like the Senior Minister of State to explain how adjusting the minimum Qualifying Salaries can totally negate the negative impact of Singaporeans workers having to pay CPF but EPs do not have to pay CPF."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00415,2023-11-06-T-010,415,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, how we derive the Qualifying Salary is a methodology we adopt from wage data that we get and it has all been published. This question that Mr Leong has asked has also been answered several times in the PQs. It is irrelevant to today's amendment Bill and I think if he wants to really have even more PQs answered on this, he should file PQs in subsequent Sittings. I do not want to waste Members' time arguing about something that has been answered before, that is irrelevant to today's administrative amendment of two particular aspects of the CPF."
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00416,2023-11-06-T-010,416,Speaker,Anyone else? Any clarifications to seek from Senior Minister of State Koh? No.
2023-11-06-T-010-S-00417,2023-11-06-T-010,417,Speaker,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2023-11-06-T-011-S-00421,2023-11-06-T-011,421,Speaker,"Before I call Member, Mr Vikram Nair, to move his Motion, I wish to inform Members who asked the more than 40 Parliamentary Questions (PQs) on the Israel-Hamas conflict that I will give ample opportunity for all of you to ask any Supplementary Questions at the end of the debate on the Motion. I am making this ruling, so this is to ensure the orderly flow of debate on the Motion and to enable all Members to make your speeches without disruption."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00422,2023-11-06-T-011,422,Speaker,I will also allow other Members the opportunity to raise their clarifications after all Members have spoken. Mr Vikram Nair.

2023-11-06-T-011-S-00426,2023-11-06-T-011,426,Vikram Nair,Israel's military operations in the Gaza strip
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00427,2023-11-06-T-011,427,Vikram Nair,(a) expresses its deepest condolences to all innocent victims and civilian casualties;
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00428,2023-11-06-T-011,428,Vikram Nair,(b) advocates the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population in Gaza;

2023-11-06-T-011-S-00433,2023-11-06-T-011,433,Vikram Nair,[(proc text) *The Motion also stood in the names of Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. (proc text)]
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00434,2023-11-06-T-011,434,Vikram Nair,"Sir, the situation in the Gaza is tragic. On 7 October 2023, Israel was attacked by air, land and sea by Hamas. This included a physical invasion into Israeli territory and rocket attacks, killing more than 1,200 people in Israel, and with more than 200 being taken prisoner and held as hostages."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00435,2023-11-06-T-011,435,Vikram Nair,"Since then, the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has moved into the Gaza with the aim of eliminating the threat from Hamas in self-defence. According to both the Reuters and BBC, the civilian death toll in the Gaza is more than 9,000."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00436,2023-11-06-T-011,436,Vikram Nair,"Over the weekend, I listened to stories played on BBC radio, interviewing family members of the victims of this war and those who have been living in the war zone. These were heart-wrenching."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00437,2023-11-06-T-011,437,Vikram Nair,I would like to express my deepest condolences to all the innocent victims and civilian casualties both of the initial terrorist attacks by Hamas as well as the subsequent ground operations by the IDF as set out in limb (a) of the proposed Motion.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00438,2023-11-06-T-011,438,Vikram Nair,"I now move to limb (b). The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire and, since this Motion was filed, has gotten worse. The civilian population has had to deal with shortages of drinking water, power, food and medicines. The Isreali blockade is ostensibly to prevent these being used for military purposes."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00439,2023-11-06-T-011,439,Vikram Nair,"However, this position has been doubted even by leading Jewish lawyers, including former UK Supreme Court President, Lord Neuberger, who reiterated in an open letter that international law requires minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00440,2023-11-06-T-011,440,Vikram Nair,"The United Nations, the International Red Cross and other international organisations wish to provide aid and support to the people in Gaza, but have been facing difficulties doing so because of the blockade, as Israeli forces have cited concerns that these supplies may go into the hands of Hamas and be used for military purposes. This is why limb (b) advocates for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00441,2023-11-06-T-011,441,Vikram Nair,"Since this Motion was filed, events have moved on."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00442,2023-11-06-T-011,442,Vikram Nair,"The UN has since passed resolution ES 10-21, which calls for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities. Singapore voted in favour of this resolution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00443,2023-11-06-T-011,443,Vikram Nair,"In the same resolution, the General Assembly of the UN reiterated that unhindered access should be given to United Nations humanitarian agencies, the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations. This is a recognition that Israel has a positive duty to permit humanitarian access."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00444,2023-11-06-T-011,444,Vikram Nair,"As these are important developments, I had wanted to amend the Motion to include a specific limb for this house to support the UN resolution ES 10-21 as well as to amend limb (b) to clarify that unhindered access should be given to UN agencies, the International Red Cross and other international organisations to provide humanitarian support."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00445,2023-11-06-T-011,445,Vikram Nair,"However, procedurally, I am not able to amend my own Motion if it changes the scope of the debate, so my colleague, Mr Alex Yam, will propose specific amendments to address both these points in his speech."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00446,2023-11-06-T-011,446,Vikram Nair,"Next, limb (c) condemns those responsible for terrorist acts and also violations of international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00447,2023-11-06-T-011,447,Vikram Nair,"The ostensible reason for the attack by Hamas against Israel had to do with unhappiness with the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank as well as the clashes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Unsuspecting civilians in Israel were therefore targeted to send a political message by Hamas. Any attack that targets civilians to send a political message is a terrorist attack, and we should condemn such attacks in no uncertain terms."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00448,2023-11-06-T-011,448,Vikram Nair,"Related to this, I have received feedback asking why the attacks by Hamas are considered terrorist attacks while the response by the IDF, which has resulted in civilian casualties, has not been called one. People are especially concerned about the IDF's response because of the mounting civilian deaths and casualties in Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00449,2023-11-06-T-011,449,Vikram Nair,"Sir, I would say that the IDF is entitled to act in self-defence and to take the necessary steps to eliminate the threats to Israel. While there is some debate in international legal circles about whether or not the law of armed conflict applies to Hamas' attacks since Hamas is not a state actor and Israel may be considered an occupying force in Gaza, I think the better view is that a state is entitled to take action against a non-state actor where that non-state actor poses a threat to the country or its people and there is no state that is able to contain or take action against that non-state actor. This was the legal basis for the US-led attack on Al Qaeda in Afghanistan after the 9-11 attacks, and I think as a small country, it is important for us to recognise this principle."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00450,2023-11-06-T-011,450,Vikram Nair,"Having said that, I would also state that the IDF is obliged to comply with international humanitarian law, which is also sometimes referred to as the law of war or the law of armed conflict, when responding. There are several important principles applicable here. First, while it is legitimate for the IDF to target Hamas' military assets and weapons, it is not legitimate to target civilians or object the civilian population needs for its daily survival. Related to this, Hamas should also not be using civilians and civilian objects as human shields or co-locating military assets within them."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00451,2023-11-06-T-011,451,Vikram Nair,"Second, any attack must be proportional to the threat faced and the method used to respond should cause as little collateral damage as possible. Thus, where a precision strike is possible, that would spare civilian life and is able to achieve the military objective, that should be used over an option that would cause a large amount of collateral damage."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00452,2023-11-06-T-011,452,Vikram Nair,"Third, steps must be taken to minimise the impact of war on the civilian population. On this limb, there are conflicting views on Israel's direction to civilians to leave the war zone. One view is that this is Israel's attempt to comply with international law by asking civilians to leave the areas they intend to strike and because Hamas' military objectives are interspersed in the civilian population, this is a necessary step. Another view is that this is creating a wholesale and unnecessary displacement of the civilian population and could therefore be a breach of international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00453,2023-11-06-T-011,453,Vikram Nair,"Sir, based on the publicly available news, I am unable to take a definitive stance on whether the IDF has breached international law in the conduct of war, but I would strongly urge all participants in the combat to comply with international humanitarian law, both in spirit and letter. We should roundly condemn all breaches of international law by any participant. No matter how emotionally upset we are, we should not abandon the rule of law. These laws are designed to curb our most savage instincts in the heat of battle."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00454,2023-11-06-T-011,454,Vikram Nair,"This brings me to the next limb, which calls for all parties to ensure safety and security of civilians and to release all hostages."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00455,2023-11-06-T-011,455,Vikram Nair,The points I had made in the earlier limbs apply here. Steps should be taken to facilitate humanitarian aid reaching the civilian population and both parties should take into account international humanitarian law when conducting the conflict. This requires both actors to take steps to protect civilians from the effect of war.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00456,2023-11-06-T-011,456,Vikram Nair,"On the one hand, there are allegations that the IDF has been conducting its war with disregard to the civilian population and the mounting death toll in Palestine is cited as evidence of this."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00457,2023-11-06-T-011,457,Vikram Nair,"On the other hand, Israel contends that Hamas is using the human population as a shield, including by placing part of its military tunnel system and command network under civilian objects."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00458,2023-11-06-T-011,458,Vikram Nair,"Peter Beaumont from The Guardian, which is a newspaper that is generally sympathetic to the cause of Palestinian statehood, has said in an article on 30 October 2023, ""Hamas' attitude towards civilians during the conflict in Gaza often appears to be cynical at best. After five conflicts with Israel since 2008, Hamas is well aware of the high potential for civilian deaths in fighting with Israeli forces – and has instrumentalised those fatalities in its messaging to the world."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00459,2023-11-06-T-011,459,Vikram Nair,"That is a damning statement from a newspaper that is otherwise supportive of the Palestinian cause. I certainly hope that Hamas would take steps to prove these allegations are incorrect. In order to do so, it must make sure it does not locate its military targets amongst the civilian population and does not take steps to prevent civilians leaving conflict areas if they wish to do so."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00460,2023-11-06-T-011,460,Vikram Nair,"Next, Hamas continues to hold more than 200 civilians hostage from its invasion of Israel on 7 October."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00461,2023-11-06-T-011,461,Vikram Nair,"The taking of hostages is a violation of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. These are mainly civilians who have nothing to do with the conflict. Hamas is demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons in exchange for these civilians. These prisoners have been convicted of a range of crimes, including terrorism."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00462,2023-11-06-T-011,462,Vikram Nair,"Sir, this is unlawful hostage taking at its worst – to capture and use civilians for collateral purposes."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00463,2023-11-06-T-011,463,Vikram Nair,"The observance of international law is particularly important for the weak and the vulnerable. If Hamas and its combatants wish to hold the moral high ground in their fight for a Palestinian state, they must show that they respect international law. Many of us, myself included, are sympathetic to the cause of Palestinian statehood, but we respectfully say this is the wrong way to win the moral support for it."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00464,2023-11-06-T-011,464,Vikram Nair,"My colleague, Mr Alex Yam, will be proposing some amendments to this limb of the Motion to expressly reiterate that parties must comply with the positive obligations under international law, including to minimise the effects of war on the civilian population."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00465,2023-11-06-T-011,465,Vikram Nair,"The next limb, Sir, reiterates Singapore's long-standing commitment to a negotiated two-state solution consistent with the relevant United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions. This has been Singapore's position since 1967."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00466,2023-11-06-T-011,466,Vikram Nair,"While the history of this land, now shared by the Palestinian and Jewish peoples, goes back thousands of years, I will focus on the more recent events that have brought these two peoples together."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00467,2023-11-06-T-011,467,Vikram Nair,"At the end of World War I, the Ottoman Empire, which fought alongside Germany, was to be dismantled. Palestine, which was under the rule of the Ottomans at this time, was transferred to the British, who administered it with a special mandate from the League of Nations. The area was therefore known as Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to the end of British rule in 1948."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00468,2023-11-06-T-011,468,Vikram Nair,"The Zionist cause, or movement for the creation of a Jewish nation, was also growing in Europe around this time. In 1917, the British has signed the Balfour declaration that promised its support for a Jewish ""national home"" in Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00469,2023-11-06-T-011,469,Vikram Nair,"The Jewish people had been displaced from their homeland and had been dispersed in many parts of the world, including Europe, other parts of the Middle East and the US for centuries. The Zionist movement grew from a longing by the Jewish community to return to their homeland and have a nation of their own."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00470,2023-11-06-T-011,470,Vikram Nair,"During the period of British rule, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine. As the Jewish population grew and the demands for Jewish statehood got stronger, the local Palestinian population also started asserting themselves and there were various clashes between the Jewish and Palestinian communities during this period, with both demanding independent statehood."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00471,2023-11-06-T-011,471,Vikram Nair,"The UN first proposed a partition plan to divide the territory into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, in November 1947, with the British ready to relinquish control. Unfortunately, this agreement did not prevent conflict and civil war broke out shortly thereafter between the Jewish and Arab peoples in Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00472,2023-11-06-T-011,472,Vikram Nair,"The British terminated their mandate on 14 May 1948 and Israel declared independence on the same day. The next day, on 15 May 1948, the armies of five neighbouring Arab states invaded the area of Mandatory Palestine, starting the first Arab-Israeli war."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00473,2023-11-06-T-011,473,Vikram Nair,"At the end of the war in 1949, which resulted in an armistice amongst the warring parties, Israel had more territory than the original UN partition plan while no independent state of Palestine emerged. Instead, the remaining territory in the former Mandatory Palestine was held by Egypt and Jordan."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00474,2023-11-06-T-011,474,Vikram Nair,"There followed large waves of immigration thereafter, both of Palestinian people out of Israeli territory as well as of Jewish people out of Arab territories and into the newly formed nation of Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00475,2023-11-06-T-011,475,Vikram Nair,"In 1967, Israel was once again attacked by its Arab neighbours and the resulting six-day war resulted in the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian lands of West Bank and the Gaza Strip, along with the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and the Syrian Golan Heights. These are all territories which were part for the former Mandatory Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00476,2023-11-06-T-011,476,Vikram Nair,"In 1973, there was yet another attack on Israel, the Yom Kippur War, from which Israel again emerged victorious."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00477,2023-11-06-T-011,477,Vikram Nair,"Although Israel's right to self-defence is universally acknowledged, its prolonged occupation of these territories was criticised, even by its own allies. The most controversial aspect was the starting of Israeli settlements on the occupied territories. These settlements would make any subsequent disengagement of Israel from these lands more difficult."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00478,2023-11-06-T-011,478,Vikram Nair,"While relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours appeared moribund, signs of thawing emerged in the late 1970s, which culminated in the Camp David Summit brokered by US President Jimmy Carter in 1978."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00479,2023-11-06-T-011,479,Vikram Nair,"Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadar met. Here, a framework for peace in the Middle East was agreed upon, with a process for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza and a framework for conclusion of a peace treaty between Israel, Egypt and other Arab nations. This paved the way for the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, in which Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt and Egypt opened the Suez Canal to Israeli ships."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00480,2023-11-06-T-011,480,Vikram Nair,"Unfortunately, at this time, many other Arab nations rejected this, as did the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00481,2023-11-06-T-011,481,Vikram Nair,"The next big step to Palestinian statehood came with the Oslo accords, which were signed in 1993 and 1995, this time involving Israeli Prime Minister Yithzak Rabin and PLO Leader Yaasar Arafat in a process facilitated by Norway. Both men won the Nobel Peace prize, along with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, for their efforts on Middle East peace."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00482,2023-11-06-T-011,482,Vikram Nair,"An agreement was reached for the setting up of an interim Palestinian government for five years, during which unresolved issues would be addressed. These accords also provided a framework for the withdrawal in phases of the Israeli armed forces from Palestinian territory, with Israel retaining responsibility for protecting the territories from air and sea attack but with the Palestinian authorities setting up a stronger police force to take over the responsibilities for internal security."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00483,2023-11-06-T-011,483,Vikram Nair,"While this was a landmark move towards Palestinian statehood and peace in the Middle East, the leaders involved both faced criticisms from their own populations or, at least, from parts of them. Prime Minister Yithzak Rabin himself was tragically assassinated in November 1995 by Yigal Amir, a far-right extremist in Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00484,2023-11-06-T-011,484,Vikram Nair,"In 1996, elections were held in Palestine, with Yaasar Arafat emerging as President. His party, Fatah, won 55 of the 88 seats in parliament too. In 1999, the interim Palestinian Authority became permanent."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00485,2023-11-06-T-011,485,Vikram Nair,"Israel, for its part, began its disengagement from the Gaza, with its settlers and military presence withdrawn by 2005. Israel takes the position that it is no longer occupying the Gaza, although the UN and other agencies still views Israel as an occupying force because it maintains control over the Gaza's air and maritime space as well as several land borders."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00486,2023-11-06-T-011,486,Vikram Nair,"Notwithstanding this, the withdrawal of settlements and the military from the Gaza was a positive step for Palestinian statehood."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00487,2023-11-06-T-011,487,Vikram Nair,"Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated following the 2006 parliamentary elections in Palestine, where Hamas won the majority of seats in the parliament, with most of their support coming from the Gaza. The presidential elections had been won the year earlier, in 2005, by Mahmoud Abbas from the Fatah party. Shortly after this, in 2007, after the failure of a national unity government involving Fatah and Hamas, fighting broke out between the two."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00488,2023-11-06-T-011,488,Vikram Nair,"In the course of this fighting, Hamas seized control of the Gaza with its militia. The Palestinian Authority under President Mahmoud Abbas retained control of the West Bank. Since then, the legal status of the Gaza has been grey. It is part of the Palestinian territory but under the de facto rule of Hamas. There have been no presidential or parliamentary elections in Palestine since then, so neither Hamas nor Fatah can point to any recent mandate."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00489,2023-11-06-T-011,489,Vikram Nair,"The journey to Palestinian statehood is a complex one and in order to get there, it will be necessary both for Israel to play its part in withdrawing its military forces and settlements, as well as for the Palestinian peoples to show that they are capable of governing themselves and will not be a security threat to their neighbours. Unfortunately, this latest attack by Hamas on Israel adds to the legitimacy of Israel's security concerns and may set back the journey to Palestinian statehood even further."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00490,2023-11-06-T-011,490,Vikram Nair,"Notwithstanding this, it is my hope that both parties realise that the only long-term solution is one where there is a framework for both to co-exist securely. Both should refocus on achieving the two-state solution, where the two people can live together securely."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00491,2023-11-06-T-011,491,Vikram Nair,I now come to the final limb of the Motion – urging all Singaporeans to safeguard and uphold our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00492,2023-11-06-T-011,492,Vikram Nair,"Singapore is a small country, far away from the conflict. Yet, when this conflict emerged, many in Singapore felt moved by it. I received many emails from residents, quite a number expressing sympathy for Hamas. Others I have spoken with said we should speak up more strongly for Israel's right of self-defence and should not be going soft on terrorist attacks."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00493,2023-11-06-T-011,493,Vikram Nair,"In Singapore, our racial and religious harmony is one that we have worked hard over the years to develop. People of different faiths live together, work together and even take steps to understand each other. It is not uncommon for people to visit places of worship even if they do not personally worship there. I myself have been to churches, mosques and temples, Hindu, Buddhist and Taoist, and I have always enjoyed learning about different religions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00494,2023-11-06-T-011,494,Vikram Nair,"In order to maintain this peace, we need to find common ground and tolerance. We need to look for things that bring us together rather than differences that divide us. I think many of us share an understanding that both the Palestinians and Jewish people have a right to peaceful existence and a nation of their own."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00495,2023-11-06-T-011,495,Vikram Nair,"Let us come together, in solidarity, to support the cause for peace and security in the Middle East. I hope for your support for this Motion. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00496,2023-11-06-T-011,496,Speaker,"Mr Vikram Nair, you are correct that procedurally, you cannot amend your own Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00497,2023-11-06-T-011,497,Speaker,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00498,2023-11-06-T-011,498,Speaker,Mr Alex Yam.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00499,2023-11-06-T-011,499,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, before I begin, with your permission, may I propose an amendment to the Motion, which has the agreement and support of my co-sponsors of the earlier Motion?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00500,2023-11-06-T-011,500,Speaker,Can I have a copy of your amendment? [
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00501,2023-11-06-T-011,501,Alex Yam,"Yes, Mr Speaker. May I also seek Mr Speaker's agreement to distribute copies of the UN Resolution to be quoted in the same amendment as well as the Explanation of Vote by Singapore's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Burhan Gafoor?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00502,2023-11-06-T-011,502,Speaker,Please proceed. [
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00503,2023-11-06-T-011,503,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following amendments"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00504,2023-11-06-T-011,504,Alex Yam,"One, ""After line 4, to insert a new part with the words 'Supports UN Resolution ES-10/21, which calls for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities'"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00505,2023-11-06-T-011,505,Alex Yam,"Two, ""In line 5, the words 'and unhindered access to United Nations humanitarian agencies, the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations' be added at the end"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00506,2023-11-06-T-011,506,Alex Yam,"Three, ""In line 7, after the word 'Calls', to delete the word 'for' and insert 'on'"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00507,2023-11-06-T-011,507,Alex Yam,"Four, ""In line 7, after the words 'all parties to', to insert the following  'comply fully with international humanitarian law, including to'"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00508,2023-11-06-T-011,508,Alex Yam,"Five, ""In line 7, to delete 'including the release of all hostages' and insert 'release all hostages and minimise the effects of combat on the civilian population'""; and lastly,"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00509,2023-11-06-T-011,509,Alex Yam,"Six, ""Consequential amendment to rename the current parts from (b) – (f) to (c) – (g)""."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00510,2023-11-06-T-011,510,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, as the hon Mr Vikram Nair has pointed out in his opening speech, we have updated our Motion to further reflect developments that have taken place since our original Motion was filed."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00511,2023-11-06-T-011,511,Alex Yam,"This includes Singapore's vote in support of the UN Emergency Session Resolution ES-10/21, which calls for an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities. A copy of the said resolution has been distributed earlier for Members' reference."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00512,2023-11-06-T-011,512,Alex Yam,"In the time since the original Motion was tabled, the situation on the ground has been fluid, with more bloodshed and accusations surfacing even as we speak right now."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00513,2023-11-06-T-011,513,Alex Yam,"Members would be well aware of the complex historic background of the conflict. Mr Vikram Nair has given a concise summary in his speech earlier. Members would also be well acquainted with the broad context of the current hostilities which I would not go into. Some in this House would perhaps have also seen or watched the content that has emerged from the last four weeks with great alarm. Let me put it plainly  horrific, tragic, unfathomable and, on occasion, unforgiveable."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00514,2023-11-06-T-011,514,Alex Yam,"As a parent, some of the images has left me stupefied and almost close to tears. It is not easy to watch and they were heart-rendering. Whatever your support for either side in this conflict, you would have to be so cold and unfeeling to deem any of it acceptable. To level such violence, barbarity, upon innocent civilians, especially children and the elderly, cannot be acceptable in any way or form."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00515,2023-11-06-T-011,515,Alex Yam,"So, let us for a moment agree, that whatever our views on the conflict, that no civilian should be considered as a legitimate and deliberate target in any conflict."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00516,2023-11-06-T-011,516,Alex Yam,I therefore call upon Members to express our deepest condolences to all innocent victims and civilians in this conflict – both Israeli and Palestinian – as well as other citizens that have been caught up in this conflagration. We therefore need also to condemn those responsible for the terrorist acts and violations of international law.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00517,2023-11-06-T-011,517,Alex Yam,"To call a spade a spade, what Hamas perpetrated on 7 October, is terrorism, plain and simple. The onslaught was to terrorise civilian targets and resulted in the deaths of over 1,400 Israelis and foreigners, mostly civilian. Not since the Holocaust have so many Jewish lives been taken in a single day."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00518,2023-11-06-T-011,518,Alex Yam,"This includes 260 people killed at a music festival in Re'im, mostly young people. Throw your mind back to the Manchester Arena bombing of May 2017. Now imagine that at the F1 Festival. Let that sink in."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00519,2023-11-06-T-011,519,Alex Yam,"Over 240 people have also been taken hostage by Hamas. This is a war crime under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, UN Resolution 34/146 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages and Article 8.2 of the ICC Statutes make it an offence as well."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00520,2023-11-06-T-011,520,Alex Yam,Israel has pursued a legitimate right to defend itself against an organisation whose expressed intent is the annihilation of Israel.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00521,2023-11-06-T-011,521,Alex Yam,"However, with that right provided by international law to defend itself comes the same obligations with the conduct of war. Even as Israeli troops encircle Gaza City and late last night – they have divided Gaza into North and South Gaza – the death toll has risen to an as yet unverified 9,227, of which an estimated 40% are children, 65% if you include women. Proportionality, a dirty word in Israel at the moment, has come to mind. It is codified in the Geneva Conventions and is a core principle of international humanitarian law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00522,2023-11-06-T-011,522,Alex Yam,"Proportionality states that while it is recognised that in operations against military objectives, civilian casualties are sometimes unavoidable, it is however imperative that the various warring parties – states and non-state armed groups alike – take all possible measures to minimise losses amongst the civilian population. If it is feared that an attack will cause excessive, disproportionate collateral damage to the concrete and direct military advantage expected, it should be cancelled or interrupted."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00523,2023-11-06-T-011,523,Alex Yam,"We, must therefore considering these two circumstances"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00524,2023-11-06-T-011,524,Alex Yam,"Firstly, demand the cessation of terror attacks and the immediate safe release of all hostages by Hamas; and"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00525,2023-11-06-T-011,525,Alex Yam,"Secondly, that Israel, in its pursuit of a legitimate defence, ensure full adherence to the norms of humanitarian law in the conduct of war, and avoiding a collective punishment of a population."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00526,2023-11-06-T-011,526,Alex Yam,"Thirdly, both sides are to ensure the safety and security as well as minimise the effect of conflict on all civilians and allow full access to humanitarian aid."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00527,2023-11-06-T-011,527,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, Singapore's unwavering commitment to international law stands as a cornerstone of our foreign policy. We have consistently advocated for the adherence to established international legal norms and principles, and we are not hesitant to speak forthrightly even to our own close allies when we believe they have transgressed these said principles."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00528,2023-11-06-T-011,528,Alex Yam,"When Russia invaded Ukraine, we stood in solidarity with Ukraine. We resolutely maintain that only through the collective respect for international law can rights and security of a small nation like ours be safeguarded."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00529,2023-11-06-T-011,529,Alex Yam,"Over the years, Singapore has consistently voted in alignment with these principles and commitment to international law. We have taken a firm stance on numerous resolutions related to Israel and Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00530,2023-11-06-T-011,530,Alex Yam,There are some who imply that Singapore is biased in our support of one party in this conflict. Allow me to briefly recap the key occasions in which we have voted against a key ally in favour of peace and stability in the region in various UN General Assemblies over the past two decades.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00531,2023-11-06-T-011,531,Alex Yam,"Most recently, as I quoted earlier, the Emergency Session Resolution on 27 October 2023 in which we voted in favour of a resolution titled ""Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations"". The resolution called for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce, provision of essential supplies to civilians in Gaza and for Israel to rescind its evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00532,2023-11-06-T-011,532,Alex Yam,"Our Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Burhan, explained our support that despite registering our regret for the omissions in the said Motion as Singapore has ""always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system"". The full text of the EoV is in the documents that were circulated earlier."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00533,2023-11-06-T-011,533,Alex Yam,"Moving back further, I would not go into the details, but this can be easily found in the UN Library 2017, 2011, 2004, 2003, 2002, 1997, even as far back as 1967 when the Israelis were extending support for our armed forces, we voted against the Israelis at the UN over matters of principles."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00534,2023-11-06-T-011,534,Alex Yam,"By consistently casting our vote in alignment with those principles, we emphasise our unwavering stance on the importance of a negotiated two-state solution and the need for all parties to act within the bounds of international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00535,2023-11-06-T-011,535,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, while this conflict may be geographically far away from us, with the ubiquity of social media, regional conflicts no longer remain confined to their immediate surrounds. They possess the potential to reverberate and touch us here even in Singapore, while we observe the unfolding tragedy from what seems like a safe distance."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00536,2023-11-06-T-011,536,Alex Yam,This reality underscores the profound impact that such conflicts can have on the fabric of our local community relations. It becomes imperative for us to recognise and address the potential toxicity that may seep into our own midst as a consequence.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00537,2023-11-06-T-011,537,Alex Yam,"Perhaps, for many of us it is due to all too natural human instincts to be consumed by genuine concerns, influenced by our own religious affiliations, our relationships and our affinity as we digest the information flow in the news outlets and on the social media. Yet we must be restrained in how we react."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00538,2023-11-06-T-011,538,Alex Yam,"We must appreciate that the social environment which we have built our society and our nation around that we must be vigilant against allowing these differences to fracture the unity of our diverse community. The Government's pledge to safeguard our multi-religious harmony remains unwavering. Members of the House, as representatives of our voters, it is therefore our duty to uphold these principles as well and ensure that our local relationships remain resilient, transcending the turbulence of global conflicts."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00539,2023-11-06-T-011,539,Alex Yam,"We must unite at times like these, rather than seek to divide or seek political dividends."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00540,2023-11-06-T-011,540,Alex Yam,"Let us not kid ourselves, all it takes is a cursory search and you will see that since the 7 October, online traffic and misinformation targeting Singapore and our local population has been on an exponential rise."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00541,2023-11-06-T-011,541,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, we are at risk."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00542,2023-11-06-T-011,542,Alex Yam,"In this vein, I have earlier in my PQs asked for the Home Affairs Ministry's assessment on the heightened risks to our social fabric and how we can better safeguard ourselves."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00543,2023-11-06-T-011,543,Alex Yam,"We must also engage in an open and honest conversation about the situation which is why Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Zhulkarnain and myself have decided to propose this Motion for debate today. Misguided beliefs and distorted narratives can further escalate tensions and lead to divisions within our community and, collectively, we must re-double our efforts to ensure that Singaporeans have access to reliable sources of information and are equipped to discern fact from fiction. By doing so, we empower Singaporeans to make informed decisions and engage in constructive dialogues, even in the face of contentious global issues."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00544,2023-11-06-T-011,544,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, a wise man once asked, how do we know when the darkness of night becomes the light of day? Is it when we can see the sun? No, his answer was that darkness can only truly give way to light when we see the humanity in each other, when we can regard each other as a brother or a sister, despite our differences."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00545,2023-11-06-T-011,545,Alex Yam,"Mr Speaker, this is a complex conflict, with a complex history. While we do not have a simple quick-fix solution to it, we can play our part by not complicating it even further."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00546,2023-11-06-T-011,546,Alex Yam,"Here in Singapore, we need to make sure that we are always in the light of day – standing by our principles and regarding fellow Singaporeans regardless of our views as fellow Singaporeans. We must regard each other, of course, with respect, compassion and an acknowledgement of our kinship with each other as fellow citizens."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00547,2023-11-06-T-011,547,Alex Yam,"May Singapore continue to stand as a shining example of tolerance and mutual understanding in our multicultural, multiracial and multi-religious community, a testament to the strength that emerges from our diversity. It is, therefore, important now, more than ever, that we uphold and protect this precious legacy, for it is the bedrock upon which our nation's peace and security is built. Let us unite our voices in the collective call for a safer and more harmonious world and for a resolution to the current conflict in Israel and the Gaza. Mr Speaker, I beg to move. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00548,2023-11-06-T-011,548,Speaker,There are five substantive amendments proposed by Member Mr Alex Yam to the Motion and a consequential amendment. They are
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00549,2023-11-06-T-011,549,Speaker,"Amendment No 1, ""After line 4, to insert a new part with the words 'Supports UN Resolution ES-10/21, which calls for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities'"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00550,2023-11-06-T-011,550,Speaker,"Amendment No 2, ""In line 5, the words 'and unhindered access to United Nations humanitarian agencies, the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations' be added at the end"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00551,2023-11-06-T-011,551,Speaker,"Amendment No 3, ""In line 7, after the word 'Calls', to delete the word 'for' and insert 'on'"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00552,2023-11-06-T-011,552,Speaker,"Amendment No 4, ""In line 7, after the words 'all parties to', to insert the following  'comply fully with international humanitarian law, including to'"";"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00553,2023-11-06-T-011,553,Speaker,"Amendment No 5, ""In line 7, to delete 'including the release of all hostages' and insert 'release all hostages and minimise the effects of combat on the civilian population'""."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00554,2023-11-06-T-011,554,Speaker,"And if the new part is agreed to, Mr Alex Yam's consequential amendment is to ""rename the current parts from (b) – (f) to (c) – (g)""."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00555,2023-11-06-T-011,555,Speaker,It may be convenient that the debate on the original Motion and on any other amendments moved by Members be proceeded with simultaneously as a debate on a single question. Do I have hon Members' agreement to this?
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00556,2023-11-06-T-011,556,Speaker,[(proc text) Hon Members indicated assent. (proc text)]
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00557,2023-11-06-T-011,557,Speaker,"""The Question is the amendments as moved by Mr Alex Yam"". Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00558,2023-11-06-T-011,558,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir. I rise in support of this Motion moved by my hon friend, Mr Vikram Nair. Like him and many others in this Chamber and across the world, I share the concerns about the plight of innocent civilians impacted."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00559,2023-11-06-T-011,559,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"We must reject and condemn violence against the innocent and any civilian. There is no justification for what has happened on 7 October, amongst those killed are citizens from other countries including those from our close neighbours in ASEAN  18 Thai nationals killed with another 11 taken hostage, seven Filipinos missing and one Cambodian student killed."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00560,2023-11-06-T-011,560,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,What happened after that – the chaos and destruction in Gaza – is even more distressing.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00561,2023-11-06-T-011,561,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In Gaza, out of the almost 9,000 people reportedly dead, more than 3,600 were children killed in the first 25 days. That is a staggering 40% of the entire fatalities. We are not even talking about children who have become orphans overnight, found themselves without a roof over their heads, or those who will have to live the rest of their lives permanently disabled."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00562,2023-11-06-T-011,562,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"There are also about 30 Israeli children who have been taken hostage. These children must be returned to their parents and families. It is now over a month and their safety is not just unknown but also uncertain, given the bombardment of Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00563,2023-11-06-T-011,563,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Sir, allow me to speak as a parent. Earlier last year, I welcomed the birth of my newborn son in difficult and emergency circumstances. I saw firsthand in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU), babies who are clinging on to their lives, fighting to survive every single day."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00564,2023-11-06-T-011,564,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"What I saw and read of the reports in Gaza, was the bombing of hospitals and health facilities, the cutting of electricity, medical aid and other necessities. The helpless children and newborn in the ICUs of such hospitals in Gaza would stand no chance. This is compounded by the shutdown of Internet and communications essential to emergency services. As such, I support the Singapore Government's actions on 28 October to vote in favour of the UN General Assembly Resolution calling for, among other things, a humanitarian truce and aid access to the besieged Gaza Strip."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00565,2023-11-06-T-011,565,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Singapore could have just remained apathetic like the 45 other countries in the world who abstained in vote, but we stood up and put forward our position, voting on principles of humanity and international law. I thus support the amendments to this Motion proposed by Member Mr Alex Yam and co-sponsor of this Motion, which highlight this recent UN resolution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00566,2023-11-06-T-011,566,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not an overnight issue that has just been brought to light. This is an issue, although complex and emotive, is very important to the peace and stability of not only the Middle East but the rest of the world. This is not a religious or theological issue either; neither can we paint everyone with the same brush – not all Israelis voted for their government, not all Palestinians in Gaza are supporters of Hamas."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00567,2023-11-06-T-011,567,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"This is also not an issue on Gaza alone but the rest of Palestine. For instance, in West Bank, where Hamas has no control, according to the humanitarian charity Save the Children, before 7 October, at least 38 Palestinian children have been killed this year, making it the deadliest year since records began. This equates to more than one Palestinian child killed per week. Further, at least six Israeli children were killed in the same period, three times more than last year."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00568,2023-11-06-T-011,568,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"This is a long-standing issue with deep historical roots. The world needs to do more globally to stop this cycle of violence and protect the children, whether they are Arabs or Jews, Israelis or Palestinians."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00569,2023-11-06-T-011,569,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised issues impacting civilians in Israel and the Palestinian Territories previously in this House."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00570,2023-11-06-T-011,570,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In 2021, following the violence in Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, I posed a question in Parliament. Minister Balakrishnan, in his responses, made it clear that Singapore's primary concern has always been the safety and security of civilians on all sides and that international law and agreements must be upheld. Last year, I asked about Singapore's efforts to support the Palestinian Authority. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) updated that since 2013, more than 700 Palestinian Authority officials and students have benefited through the Enhanced Technical Assistance Programme (ETAP) training courses and study visits to Singapore. This year during the Committee of Supply (COS) debates, I asked again on Singapore's role to alleviate the Palestinian-Israeli tensions, whether on our own or together with the Gulf countries."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00571,2023-11-06-T-011,571,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Where there were breaches of international law through illegal settlements and unilateral declarations of Jerusalem as capital city, Singapore has shown the courage of conviction to call it out through voting at the UN General Assembly resolutions ever since 1967."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00572,2023-11-06-T-011,572,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Singapore's position has always been constant and principled. As a small country, we must always mean what we say and say what we mean. We can only take the side of principles and the law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00573,2023-11-06-T-011,573,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, war or conflict in the history of mankind is inevitable. But over the years, there are rules of engagement and international humanitarian law to ensure non-combatant casualties are kept to a minimal. The law balances a nation's right to use deterrence as self-defence while mitigating the excessive brutalities and destruction that war would bring."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00574,2023-11-06-T-011,574,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Assistant Professor Yuan Yi Zhu, of International Relations and International Law at Leiden University, the Netherlands, and a Research Fellow at Harris Manchester College, Oxford, recently stated  ""International humanitarian law has broad acceptance because it seeks to mitigate the worst effects of armed conflict instead of banning it entirely. If it's construed in a way that allows no practical military operations to take place, belligerents might just ignore it outright."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00575,2023-11-06-T-011,575,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"International law, namely the Geneva Convention, is intended to protect innocent civilians during armed conflict and prohibits the targeting of civilians and essential objects indispensable to the survival of civilian population. There are four basic principles  first, distinction between non-combatants and others; second, military necessity; third, unnecessary suffering; and fourth, proportionality."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00576,2023-11-06-T-011,576,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"On necessity and proportionality, there is a grey line when collateral damages cross into collective punishment. International humanitarian law ensures that collective punishment for a crime committed by an individual is forbidden."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00577,2023-11-06-T-011,577,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"For the current conflict, in the face of what has been reported or what appears to be breaches of humanitarian law, I am deeply distressed and concerned because I am only human. But I remain calm because I believe in justice and the due process of the law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00578,2023-11-06-T-011,578,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"After the dust settles, a fuller investigation of the evidence and such breaches of international law can and must be made. In this age of technological advancement and social media, evidence can be found, witnesses can corroborate and false information can be sifted out so that any breaches of international law would one day come to light and the perpetrators would be brought to the International Courts of Justice for their day of reckoning."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00579,2023-11-06-T-011,579,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Against this backdrop, we must continue to have faith and continue to abide by our principles and the rule of law. In this regard, the UN has already constituted an Independent International Commission of Inquiry which has been collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes since 7 October 2023."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00580,2023-11-06-T-011,580,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I would like to ask, firstly, after this conflict has de-escalated, whether the Singapore Government would support a call for parties to render full cooperation and facilitate the investigative work of the Commission of Inquiry and seek that the Commission discloses its reports or outcomes as soon as possible."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00581,2023-11-06-T-011,581,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Secondly, given that most of our humanitarian aid donated to Gaza will go through Egypt, whether the Singapore Government will ask our Egypt counterparts to assist and facilitate the movement of aid and assistance through the opening of the Rafah crossing bordering Gaza, which has seen tight restrictions since 2014."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00582,2023-11-06-T-011,582,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Thirdly, besides the current assistance pledged by the Singapore Government, I hope that Singapore can also perhaps consider providing critical vaccinations and other medication for the Palestinian population who are facing a health crisis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00583,2023-11-06-T-011,583,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, putting aside what needs to be done by the world collectively which goes beyond our powers, we are not entirely without hope and we are not completely helpless because of what we can do here in Singapore. Mr Speaker, in Malay please."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00584,2023-11-06-T-011,584,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Palestinian civilians in Gaza are now facing a health crisis sparked by the destruction of public infrastructure, such as hospitals, ambulances and medical supplies that were blocked. The UN on 2 November stated that ""Gaza is running out of time"" and it is a critical time for Palestinians right now."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00585,2023-11-06-T-011,585,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Innocent children have become victims of the relentless violence of war. Those caught in the middle of the conflict are Palestinians from different religions and backgrounds. Palestinian civilians who have done no wrong are yearning for peace and prosperity for their families and children. But now, they are facing a bleak future. We need compassion and protection of the Palestinian civilians' rights."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00586,2023-11-06-T-011,586,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I would like to call on everyone, that this crisis in Gaza requires a humanitarian effort that needs mass support."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00587,2023-11-06-T-011,587,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Over the years, I have raised this issue in Parliament about humanitarian efforts and Singapore's support towards the peace process in the Middle East."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00588,2023-11-06-T-011,588,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I was thankful when a humanitarian channel was recently opened for supplies to enter Gaza even if it was for a brief period. I am also touched by the encouraging amount of donation for humanitarian aid in Gaza, not only from our Malay/Muslim community, but from all Singaporeans. This demonstrates our collective effort regardless of race, religion or age."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00589,2023-11-06-T-011,589,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Spiritually, our Malay/Muslim community has also prayed for peace in our mosques through special prayer sessions and reciting the supplication Qunut Nazilah during prayer. For instance, Pergas organized the first special prayer session at the Kassim Mosque. I also attended the special prayers at Al-Firdaus mosque with our foreign workers and at the Al-Khair mosque with Chua Chu Kang residents. Many of our old and young congregants were also there. This is not only a way to practice our faith, but it also demonstrates to everyone that our religion teaches us to give emphasis to compassion, peace and humanity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00590,2023-11-06-T-011,590,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I hope we can do more to also make the call to our foreign Muslim workers who are working here, so that they also understand our ways and become part of this effort in Singapore"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00591,2023-11-06-T-011,591,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Globally, I hope the Government will also support a humanitarian ceasefire as voted by the UN, so that basic aid can be allowed to continue. I also support the Commission of Inquiry that is set up by the UN to gather and preserve evidence of war crimes, and investigate allegations of international law violations. I hope Singapore will support the proposal to bring anyone who is guilty and who violates international law, so that they will face justice and a day of reckoning in future."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00592,2023-11-06-T-011,592,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, Sir, I spoke in Malay about the efforts of the community to support the humanitarian cause in Gaza, together with our nation."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00593,2023-11-06-T-011,593,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Our Mufti exemplified leadership in extending not only compassion and our condolences for those who have lost lives and loved ones but also our collective condemnation against violence. During this period, our religious leaders have also guided our asatizah and community in handling the deluge of information and emotional impact on all of us through the khutbah sermons during Friday prayers and religious guidance. Mufti's leadership showcases to the world that Islam emphasises peace and compassion for all."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00594,2023-11-06-T-011,594,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"However, there is a view questioning the need for such religious guidance. In this regard what is the Government's position on such views, especially in conflicts which are complex and go beyond the religious realm?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00595,2023-11-06-T-011,595,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we must guard against rhetoric which cause divisions in our society. We cannot be pulled into a partisan fight pitting one against the other."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00596,2023-11-06-T-011,596,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Let us have the conviction of courage to do the right thing and show empathy for all affected. Let us not allow conflicts overseas to sow discords of disharmony amongst us. Let us remain united with fellow Singaporeans to stand side by the side – on the side of humanity and compassion.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00597,2023-11-06-T-011,597,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The one thing that this tragedy proves to us is this – the Palestinians people's aspirations, pain and suffering cannot be ignored if we want longstanding peace and stability for both Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side and prosper together. Longstanding peace cannot be achieved through a cycle of violence. It is broken through the intervention of love, humanity and compassion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00598,2023-11-06-T-011,598,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Quoting from Martin Luther King, ""Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00599,2023-11-06-T-011,599,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Motion and beg to move. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00600,2023-11-06-T-011,600,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00601,2023-11-06-T-011,601,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, before speaking on the substantive and amended Motions, I would like to recall the perspective of our first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, which he shared in 2013, referring to the larger canvas against which the latest hostilities between Israel and Hamas have occurred."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00602,2023-11-06-T-011,602,Pritam Singh,"I quote, ""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the biggest problem plaguing the Middle East. It is a running sore that oozes pus all the time. To end the conflict, there has to be a two-state solution – one for the Israelis and one for the Palestinians. The Palestinian state must also be economically and politically viable. Its people must feel that they have a reasonable chance of making a success out of their country. Only then will they have a vested interest in keeping peace in this troubled region."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00603,2023-11-06-T-011,603,Pritam Singh,"""Because of the pro-Israel policy the Jewish lobby has succeeded in forging for America, a hardline stance is allowed to prevail in the Israeli leadership. This can have adverse and irreversible effects on the peace process. By building settlements in the occupied territories, for example, Israel is slowly but surely annexing land that would be handed over to the Palestinians in any potential deal between the two sides."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00604,2023-11-06-T-011,604,Pritam Singh,"""Ultra-conservatives in Israel believe the settlements bring Israel closely to its rightful historical borders as laid out in the Hebrew bible. They believe recovering the land is ordained by God, no less. The settlements represent an unwelcomed revision to an already complicated status quo. They are causing the prospects of any future possible deal to become ever remote."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00605,2023-11-06-T-011,605,Pritam Singh,"Mr Lee continues, ""With every passing day, a permanent solution to the conflict becomes less likely. The United Nations has declared the Israeli settlements a violation of international law, describing them as a creeping annexation. The Israelis, however, know that such declarations are toothless unless they are endorsed by the Americans."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00606,2023-11-06-T-011,606,Pritam Singh,"""If, for example, the Americans are willing to cut off financial aid to Israel amounting to $115 billion since 1949 as well as other forms of military and political support until the building of settlements stops, Israel will have no choice but to act. Without the Americans putting pressure on Israel, there is no end in sight for the conflict."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00607,2023-11-06-T-011,607,Pritam Singh,"Mr Lee also warns, ""The conflict also serves as an evergreen cause which Jihadists can exploit as part of their propaganda efforts to attract young recruits. The cause is kept alive across the Middle East as well as in other parts of Asia through television images that play up Palestinian sufferings."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00608,2023-11-06-T-011,608,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, since 7 October, thousands of innocents have been killed and wounded in Israel and Gaza. Among those are thousands of children, the overwhelming majority of which are Palestinian. The sight of dead children being pulled from the rubble, their parents weeping, is something no sane human being could ever wish for anyone."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00609,2023-11-06-T-011,609,Pritam Singh,"Why should we in Singapore even be speaking in Parliament about what is happening in Israel and the occupied territories, including Gaza? A conflict more than 8,000 kilometers away has prompted Singaporeans from all communities to speak out and donate money to assist those in Gaza who are in dire circumstances. It is clear that Singaporeans care and are very concerned about what is happening there."

At the same time, we call for the immediate return of all Israeli hostages captured in Hamas' military operation in Southern Israel on 7 October 2023. De-escalation by all parties must be followed by a withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories, followed by serious negotiations to achieve a lasting peace in the Holy Land – a peace that legitimises the existence of the state of Israel and establishes a viable Palestinian state."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00619,2023-11-06-T-011,619,Pritam Singh,"By the time the WP released its statement on 18 October, ordinary Singaporeans were troubled and even agitated about the issue. Many wrote to the WP Members of Parliament and continue to do so."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00620,2023-11-06-T-011,620,Pritam Singh,"In the assessment of the WP, one reason that precipitated this frustration was the perception of a dominant narrative at that point in the West and other advanced economies to focus only on the actions of Hamas."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00621,2023-11-06-T-011,621,Pritam Singh,"Let me be clear – the atrocities committed against innocent civilians by Hamas militants on 7 October cannot be supported. There can be no reason to target, kill or take civilians hostage. But it is important to point out that the West's one-dimensional narrative was inadequate and incomplete because it suggested that the Israel-Palestine conflict started on 7 October 2023, with the killing of innocent civilians in Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00622,2023-11-06-T-011,622,Pritam Singh,"Absent was context – context of Israel's occupation and subjugation of the occupied territories, a matter that has not been resolved for decades, nor was there any reflection on past UN fact-finding missions to Gaza in the aftermath of previous Israel-Hamas conflicts. Nor was there any consideration of the impact of the wanton expansion of settlements in the occupied territories by successive right-wing Israeli governments, which de-legitimised the right of a Palestinian people, making any future peace even harder to reach. Ultimately, these omissions, amongst others, operated to decontextualise the tragedy that befell Israel and their people on 7 October 2023."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00623,2023-11-06-T-011,623,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, the Motion as worded by the three Members and the amended Motion as proposed by the Member, Mr Yam, is not objectionable and will be supported by the WP."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00624,2023-11-06-T-011,624,Pritam Singh,"I assume Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain will agree with me that the Israel-Hamas conflict is a subset of a larger struggle that arises out of the absence of a political resolution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. I invite all three Members to disagree with me now and for the record, if they do not agree with this statement. I am prepared to give way."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00625,2023-11-06-T-011,625,Pritam Singh,"I will continue, Mr Speaker."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00626,2023-11-06-T-011,626,Pritam Singh,"The first objective of the WP's statement of 18 October was to put out this seemingly obvious fact – that the latest eruption in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians should not be seen in isolation even as we condemn the killing of civilians by any country or organisation, including Hamas."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00627,2023-11-06-T-011,627,Pritam Singh,"Having done so, it was important to state that this latest outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas was not new. Since the withdrawal of Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip in 2006, four other major conflicts have broken out between Israel and Hamas. The tragedy that is befalling the people of Gaza today is a continuation of what has happened many times before."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00628,2023-11-06-T-011,628,Pritam Singh,"In previous bouts of violence between Israel and Hamas, 5,365 Palestinians are reported to have been killed, many of them children, while 308 Israelis are reported to have lost their lives. The same history always repeats itself."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00629,2023-11-06-T-011,629,Pritam Singh,"In the end, the story on the Palestinian side is always far more gruesome in scale – overwhelming casualties, with a large number of children among the dead. Only the ill-informed could have thought that the latest instalment was going to be any different. If history is a guide, we will soon see the number of dead Palestinians in Gaza cross the 10,000 mark, with many of the dead being women and children."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00630,2023-11-06-T-011,630,Pritam Singh,"As one senior former Israeli Defence Forces commander told me once, the Israeli way of war in the Gaza Strip is to strike hard so that the Palestinians learn a lesson they never forget. So, they live in fear and, as a result, are deterred from ever attacking Israel again. With such an approach to warfare, one that invokes collective punishment in the name of self-defence, the death of many innocent Palestinians is all but certain. Far from deterring future attacks on the Israeli state, this disproportionate response gives birth to a new generation of Palestinians that seek to avenge their forebears and some of whom see martyrdom as something to aspire to. This sad reality repeats itself ad infinitum, scuttling both the birth of a viable Palestinian state as well as creating conditions in Israel where its borders are secure and its people live in peace with their neighbours. These are the reasons that explain why the WP statement calls for an immediate ceasefire, a return of hostages and the conveyance of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, to be followed by serious negotiations towards a two-state solution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00631,2023-11-06-T-011,631,Pritam Singh,"A second important aspect of the WP statement was to identify the threat of the latest edition of the Israel-Hamas conflict to multiracial and multicultural societies and communities like Singapore. The reality of radicalisation and the prospect of uncalled for and senseless attacks against Jews and Muslims all over the world and a more unsafe world as a result, cannot be understated. Singaporeans should be alive to this and not fall prey to calls, especially online, that target Jews or Muslims. The threat is not imaginary. The long-standing Israel-Palestinian conflict was, according to the Internal Security Department, one of the reasons why a 20-year-old Singaporean was remanded some two years ago, because he planned to attack and murder Jews worshipping at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00632,2023-11-06-T-011,632,Pritam Singh,"While the call for a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict, consistent with UN Resolutions, is a clear way forward, we all know that the reality is more complex and layered, and getting to this outcome will be a struggle. For example, many months ago, the most famous historian of his generation, Yuval Harari, a Jew living in Israel, was quoted as saying on the BBC that ""my house is burning"". Prior to Hamas' unprovoked attack, an intense political battle had been taking place for Israel's soul. Deep political fissures over a fundamental tenet of democracy, the separation of powers, pitted many elements of Israeli society against the plans of a right-wing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu. I quote Yuval Harari from a piece he penned for The Financial Times in July this year, ""To understand events in Israel, there is just one question to ask  what limits the power of government? Robust democracies rely on a whole system of checks and balances, but Israel lacks a constitution, an Upper House in the Parliament, a federal structure, or any other check on government power except one, the Supreme Court. The Netanyahu government plans to pass the first in a series of laws that will neutralise the Supreme Court. If it succeeds, it will gain unlimited power."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00633,2023-11-06-T-011,633,Pritam Singh,"The International Institute for Strategic Studies, which hosts the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, reported that between March and July this year, Israeli air force reservists refused to keep up their training hours, helicopter instructor pilots refused to report for duty, and active reservists in the Special Forces refused to volunteer for service, all in the protest of the country's direction. These differences in Israeli society should remind those of us far removed that not all Israelis think alike, and that there are Jews and Israelis who may not necessarily agree with the right-wing political leadership on issues that include pursuing a strategy of settlement expansion that seeks to unilaterally change facts on the ground. It would be incorrect to think that all Jews and Israelis are monolithic in their views, even as their desire for a homeland where they can live in peace without being subjected to terrorist attacks is shared by all Israelis and friends of Israel, including Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00634,2023-11-06-T-011,634,Pritam Singh,"The nuances are no different in the case of Palestinian organisations that operate in the Gaza Strip and in the other occupied territories. This point was shrewdly emphasised by the Palestine ambassador to Malaysia last month. On the one hand, he thanked Malaysians for their steadfast support for the Palestinian cause but, on the other, warned them to channel their donations and support carefully, lest they reach the wrong hands. Some months ago, in a different context, he was on record noting that there were sectarian issues, such as internal politics involving the Palestinian population. For those who are familiar with this, the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas, for example, have different approaches to achieve their goals, even if Israel has deemed the Palestinian Authority as supporting Hamas after the latter's actions on 7 October 2023."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00635,2023-11-06-T-011,635,Pritam Singh,"While the Israel-Hamas confrontation and broader conflict look set to continue for some time, Singaporeans should be aware that in view of our multiracial and multi-religious society, this conflict will test us. But it should not be allowed to compromise our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony. As Singaporeans, we should not analyse a political issue through religious lenses. For us, it is a humanitarian issue, and both Israel and the Palestinians deserve to live in peace and harmony. Our contribution is a humanitarian one, to advocate and support calls to stop the killing, particularly of civilians and children, and to support the international community in reaching a lasting settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. To that end, the WP supports the major decision taken by Singapore at the UN General Assembly, which is referred to in the amended Motion, calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce, leading to a cessation of hostilities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00636,2023-11-06-T-011,636,Pritam Singh,This brings me to my third and final point on the importance of international law for Singapore.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00637,2023-11-06-T-011,637,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, we speak in this House on this matter because it is important for Singapore to put its position on the record. Both the parties directly involved in the conflict, as well as the rest of the international community, must know Singapore's position and our firm belief in international law and our desire for the protection of human life. The WP supports the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols that prescribe international humanitarian law. We endorse the UN Charter and other international agreements. We support them because our survival depends on them. Singapore is a small state that relies on international law, and small states need international law and their protections."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00638,2023-11-06-T-011,638,Pritam Singh,"For example, Singapore has made its position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict clear. We took particular umbrage at the Russian claim that its aggression in Ukraine was justified because of historical errors and crazy decisions. In the context of the Israel-Palestinian dispute, Singapore has voted in the UN against calls for Jerusalem to be recognised as the capital of Israel. The principles and reasons for doing so are readily apparent."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00639,2023-11-06-T-011,639,Pritam Singh,"If some religious group, militant organisation or other country justified its aggression on something other than international law, we would have to aggressively stand against such perspectives. For example, some group or organisation in a neighbouring country may argue that Singapore has been part of the Malay archipelago for centuries and, therefore, should expect to be occupied and annexed. International law is clear that this cannot be so."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00640,2023-11-06-T-011,640,Pritam Singh,"To conclude, Mr Speaker, about two decades ago, a grouping called the Middle East Quartet, made up of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, has recognised that in order to have peace, it is necessary to fulfil the aspirations of the two parties for an independent homeland through two states for two peoples – the state of Israel and an independent viable state of Palestine, both of which must be able to live in peace and security. The WP backs this stand, which is also that of the Government of Singapore, as the only feasible path to a durable, just and comprehensive resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00641,2023-11-06-T-011,641,Pritam Singh,"Today, this prospect may feel far removed, but until that day comes, it is important that Singapore advocates strongly for the safety and security of civilians and children who are the innocent victims of this long-standing conflict. We call on both Israeli and Palestinian leadership to make compromises for peace, to prevent future generations from paying for the actions of their elders – I should say, actions and omissions of their elders. A price that has proven and will continue to prove to be a high one for the world well beyond the borders of Israel and Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00642,2023-11-06-T-011,642,Speaker,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00643,2023-11-06-T-011,643,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"""I am not truly free if I am taking away someone else's freedom. Just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others"" – Nelson Mandela."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00644,2023-11-06-T-011,644,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Sir, today I rise in support of the Motion and add my voice in this Chamber to express my sorrow for the loss of innocent lives and the injustice of the cycles of violence, even as the Israel-Palestine crisis rages on. This is a fight in distant lands, but here, in Singapore, many feel empathy and distress as the news, photos and videos fill our social media feeds and our daily consciousness. If you are truly engaged with the breadth of society, you will see a range of views and levels of awareness. A number of our youths, in particular, have written to me. They seek an outlet to use their voices to do something, anything, for they cannot unsee the suffering in Gaza, they cannot reconcile it with our life as per normal and our precious peace here, and we cannot sit silent. It is reported that almost half of the Gazan population is aged 18 and under, and we feel for the mothers who have lost their children, for the men who have buried their brothers in mass graves, for the elderly who are too frail to move, and for the children whose normalcy is rubble and dust."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00645,2023-11-06-T-011,645,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"These divides arose many years, even before 7 October 2023, and have no easy answers. One might point to a time in history and someone else would go back a few years for a different view. It is hard to find common ground. Yes, there are religious bearings, but there are Christians, Jews and Muslims on both sides of the border. We cannot ignore the political, historical, land and security dimensions. There is a lot to unpack, but a few things are clear."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00646,2023-11-06-T-011,646,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"First, the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza needs to be addressed urgently. The Gaza health ministry has released figures that thousands have died, even more injured. Refugee camps, hospital areas and schools have not been spared from airstrikes. The UN relief agency, UNRWA and Committee to Protect Journalists shared that eight workers and media personnel have been killed. Civilians in Gaza were restricted access to food, water, electricity, communications, and aid was prevented from entering."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00647,2023-11-06-T-011,647,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Second, even in a fight, there are rules. International humanitarian law, as set out in the Geneva Conventions and similar treaties, has been forged from the bitter ashes of world wars as a practical balance between the security and military requirements of a state, and the protection of humans. Yes, Sir, we agree that any and all violence and kidnapping of innocent civilians are wrong. But while a state has a right to self-defence, this must be tempered by proportionality. Parties must distinguish between combatants and civilians, and many have asked  is the loss of so many innocent non-military personnel proportionate? When will the collective punishment against the Palestinian people end?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00648,2023-11-06-T-011,648,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Third, both sides must work towards a durable peace with the support of the international community. This is not the first time that violence has broken out. The result of these prolonged cycles is a gradually reduced confidence and support for a long-lasting two-state solution, according to public polls among both Israeli and Palestinian people. Some wonder, is it even possible now? Can mistrust and injustice turn to peace? Can people in positions of power in Gaza and Israel come to the table to negotiate for peace with open hearts?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00649,2023-11-06-T-011,649,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The international community must direct resources to invest in peace, so as to manage tensions at all stages of the conflict curve, involve independent parties with the conviction to see this through, prioritising local communities before it is too late."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00650,2023-11-06-T-011,650,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"This is not the first time that violence has broken out and the result of these prolonged cycles is a gradually reduced confidence and support for a long-lasting two-state solution, according to public polls among both Israeli and Palestinian people. Some wonder, ""Is it even possible now? Can mistrust and injustice turn to peace? Can people in positions of power in Gaza and Israel come to the table to negotiate for peace with open hearts?"""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00651,2023-11-06-T-011,651,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The international community must direct resources to invest in peace so as to manage tensions at all stage of the conflict curve – involve independent parties with the conviction to see this through, priorisiting local communities, before it is too late. Sir, in Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00652,2023-11-06-T-011,652,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The crisis in Gaza is deteriorating due to rising tensions. Many people around the world, including those in Singapore, have come forward to appeal for the violence to stop immediately."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00653,2023-11-06-T-011,653,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Apart from making comments, sharing videos and showing photos on social media, Singaporeans have also banded together to act collectively. We witnessed how Singaporeans from all walks of life have joined hands in efforts to provide humanitarian assistance – from supplying medical paraphernalia with Humanity Matters on 29 October, to the special mass prayer session organised by Pergas and mosques across Singapore, as well as a fundraising campaign by Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF) which managed to collect more than S$4.6 million within two weeks, and other community-based efforts by groups, such as Chendol Kita and Fabmarket, which have used their own platforms to contribute to local efforts."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00654,2023-11-06-T-011,654,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"However, humanitarian aid alone is not enough to repair and rebuild a community. To achieve lasting peace for all parties, a long-term solution should be worked out. In Singapore, we are also aware that harmony is something that is difficult to achieve and very fragile, as it requires sacrifices and an understanding that is built over decades."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00655,2023-11-06-T-011,655,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As a small nation, we must uphold integrity and be pragmatic because this will determine our future. At the UN General Assembly, Singapore supported the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and the two-state solution that was agreed by both sides through negotiations. We have also voted in favour of Palestine in various resolutions, including those in 1967 after the Six-Day War, in 1997 and 2003 against Israel in connection with the construction of the Har Homa settlement, and demanded that Israel stop the construction of the West Bank Wall, and the latest on October 27, for an immediate ceasefire, so that humanitarian aid can be extended."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00656,2023-11-06-T-011,656,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"To quote the UN Chief's speech, we are aware that the Hamas attack did not happen in isolation. Although many have mentioned the October 7 incident, we will still remember the sufferings of the people of Gaza from October 6 and the days before that. Although we acknowledge that the Hamas attack on October 7 in Israel is wrong, we mourn the loss of lives in Gaza and the West Bank and feel the injustice."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00657,2023-11-06-T-011,657,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Sir, the attack does not warrant collective punishment being inflicted upon the Palestinian people. Many Singaporeans including our youths have asked about the Singapore Government's views on the killing of civilians in Gaza, as well as other immediate actions, that the Government can take to try and stop the violence before it is too late."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00658,2023-11-06-T-011,658,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In English)  Sir, on 27 October at the UN General Assembly, Singapore voted for UN resolution ES-10/21. Our stand is consistent with the principles that are necessary for Singapore survival. In navigating tensions, we do not unequivocally support one side over another. We advocate for an inclusive, rules-based, multilateral order as a system to have recourse to when necessary."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00659,2023-11-06-T-011,659,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"But, Sir, even as we have voted in support of resolution over the years including for statehood and against illegal settlements, it appears that little progress has been made. We find ourselves in deepening divides with worsening intensities of the violence. What more can be done to enforce the rules which give us order?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00660,2023-11-06-T-011,660,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The Government does not act alone in promoting peace and providing humanitarian aid. Two weeks ago, I and around a hundred Singaporeans from all walks of life, spend time with Humanity Matters, packing about eight tonnes worth of relief supplies to Gaza. A team of four has followed the aid to Egypt donating it to the Palestine Red Crescent. And I pray for the safe return. This is our Singaporean way; not just speaking about harmony during times of peace, but being brave through our differences and rallying together during times of crisis around our common humanity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00661,2023-11-06-T-011,661,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Sir, when we speak of peace, it is not about the absence of conflict, but what prevails in spite of the differences."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00662,2023-11-06-T-011,662,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Here, in Singapore, which has been ranked as one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world, we know this intimately. We each desire the freedom to express our different identities, but this means in turn that we are committed to seeing that others with different beliefs can express their identities authentically as well."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00663,2023-11-06-T-011,663,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As an advisor to the recently concluded Harmony Circles Refresh work group together with Minister of State Alvin Tan, I know that harmony does not occur by chance. We work for it every day as a people, through compromise and acceptance and by learning from each other what makes our beliefs so secret? We treasure the safety of living in peace with others whose beliefs are different from ours while being united as one Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00664,2023-11-06-T-011,664,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"This peace is made possible in no small part due to the selfless commitment to inter-faith harmony from our religious leaders across different faiths. Mutual respect and the willingness of these leaders to stand in solidarity create a quiet but steadfast example. Notably, in the Inter-Religious Organisation of Singapore, 10 faiths, such as Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism, regularly come together and exchange views. In a world where rhetoric and sound bites go viral on social media and longer messages run the risk of getting twisted, where popularity is currency and common ground is the first casualty in a fight, it takes courage to stand for peace and conviction to nurture it, even when the position may be hard to swallow."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00665,2023-11-06-T-011,665,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"To this end, I am grateful for the discernment and compassion of our faith leaders in society. The exchange of letters between faith leaders and Singapore during times like these demonstrate commitment to protect the precious collective peace that we share. Rabbi Mordechai Abergel and Mufti Dr Nazirudin Nasir address each other with respect, express condolences and prayers for innocent lives taken unjustly and have called for a permanent peace. Even as emotions run high, let us not give in to Islamophobia, anti-Semitism or other forms of discrimination in our places of worship, our schools, our workplaces and society."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00666,2023-11-06-T-011,666,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Sir, our peace is tested in less obvious ways too, where feelings run so deep that friendships are broken over how and when people choose to use their voice. Peace breaks down when anger consumes and we feel that we cannot communicate."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00667,2023-11-06-T-011,667,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Let us hold space for each other. It is important for us Singaporeans to grow in our ability to seek understanding, step up quickly and communicate in managing a crisis while always having our nation's interests at our core. In particular, how can we encourage safe outlets for the expression, processing and validation of emotions and the promotion of understanding even when we disagree? How can our leaders at all levels in our communities and places of worship be better equipped to guide on such matters, which have implications on our shores? As the front lines of conflict are increasingly digital, how do we care for, equip and soothe a society where many spend approximately seven hours a day online."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00668,2023-11-06-T-011,668,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Sir, this conflict has exposed how untenable this current situation in Israel and Palestine is and its impact on the rest of the world. In this fractious world, Singapore is a small voice. It is easy to believe that we do not have a stake or that we cannot do much. Our sovereignty and safety are tied to a fair rules-based world order and a common humanity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00669,2023-11-06-T-011,669,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In the past few weeks, we have seen the good in humanity as well. With people of all ages, various backgrounds, faiths, all over the world, using our voice some in protest, some in prayer, donations, to converse, to listen, to bear witness to this crisis. We do what we can and here in this Chamber, we understand the desire for statehood and safety of the Palestinians and the Israelis. We use our voices to call for the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians to end. And I end with a solemn appeal for parties to abide by the humanitarian truth for an immediate cessation of the violence in Gaza and the West Bank and for justice to prevail."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00670,2023-11-06-T-011,670,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, at the outset, I would like to affirm the WP support for Israel's statehood and for the creation of a viable Palestinian State side-by-side in peace and security with Israel through a negotiated two-state solution, in line with the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00671,2023-11-06-T-011,671,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The killing of 1,400 people, most of them civilians in Israel and the taking of over 240 hostages by Hamas on 7 October 2023 cannot be justified and must be unequivocally condemned. However, the ensuing retaliation by Israel in the Gaza Strip over the past month demands critical scrutiny and a response from the International Community including Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00672,2023-11-06-T-011,672,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Since 7 October, more than 9,770 people in Gaza including thousands of children have been killed according to the health officials in Gaza. More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced and Northern Gaza has been laid siege by Israel. Israel said it dropped 6,000 bombs on the Gaza Strip in just the first week of the war. This number is surely much higher now topping the record number of bombs the US dropped in Afghanistan in the whole of 2019."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00673,2023-11-06-T-011,673,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The WP supports Israel's right to defend itself. However, this right must be wielded within the bounds of international humanitarian law, ensuring that the sanctity of human life particularly that of civilians and children is upheld even in the midst of a war."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00674,2023-11-06-T-011,674,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Israel was successful in securing its border with Gaza within days of the assault but it continues to destroy civilian infrastructure, displace hundreds of thousands of people and cut off supplies of water and electricity in the Gaza Strip. Israel must recognise that executing this asymmetric response will only breed further hatred of it among the Palestinian population and provide fuel for extremists both in Gaza and around the world, perpetrating the cycle of violence and suffering."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00675,2023-11-06-T-011,675,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Former US President Barack Obama said that upholding international law and avoiding to every extent possible the death or suffering of civilian populations is, ""vital for building alliances and shaping international opinion, all of which are critical for Israel's long-term security."" Israel therefore, must adhere strictly to the laws of war not only for the sake of the suffering Palestinians but also for its own security. Proportionality, distinction and necessity must guide its military actions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00676,2023-11-06-T-011,676,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Hamas must also immediately and unconditionally release all Israeli and foreign hostages. Failure to do so will only prolong this war and lead to a greater loss of life and hardening of hearts on both sides.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00677,2023-11-06-T-011,677,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The WP supports Singapore's vote on the resolution at the UN General Assembly on 26 October which among other things, call for an immediate durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to cessation of hostilities, as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all civilians being illegally held captive."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00678,2023-11-06-T-011,678,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Singapore may be a small country, but we must do everything within our capacity working alongside countries in the region and international agencies to deliver essential humanitarian aid to the suffering people of Gaza during this current conflict. Our assistance must go beyond alleviating immediate suffering for the Palestinians. We can also contribute to post-conflict reconstruction and development by offering more technical assistance to the Palestinians. For example, in education, public housing, urban planning, water management and tackling corruption."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00679,2023-11-06-T-011,679,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Under the auspices of the Singapore Cooperation Programme, Singapore has provided training for many Palestinian officials. In 2016, Singapore pledged a double, the enhanced technical assistance package for Palestinian officials to the quantum of $10 million. We must follow through with this pledge, as this technical assistance will be needed more than ever during the reconstruction following the war."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00680,2023-11-06-T-011,680,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Our long-standing ties with Israel go back to our early days of Independence and National Service. Singapore also has good relations with the Palestinians and with influential Muslim-majority countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Türkyie, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, some of which have established diplomatic relations with Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00681,2023-11-06-T-011,681,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Our longstanding ties with Israel go back to our early days of Independence and National Service. Singapore also has good relations with the Palestinians and with influential Muslim-majority countries, such as Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, some of which have established diplomatic relations with Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00682,2023-11-06-T-011,682,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Singapore was also the first country to sign a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council. Singapore's diplomatic standing and trade relations with these nations place us in a position to play a constructive role towards pushing for a long-term solution for peace in the region.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00683,2023-11-06-T-011,683,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"We should work with like-minded partners to help establish the foundations for enduring peace between the Israelis and Palestinians and advocate for the implementation of the two-state solution. We should seek opportunities to facilitate greater dialogue among all stakeholders, including hosting high-level summits between Israeli and Palestinian leaders."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00684,2023-11-06-T-011,684,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Singapore could provide a neutral venue for peace talks, away from the conflict zone. This potential peacemaking role is consistent with past initiatives."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00685,2023-11-06-T-011,685,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In 2018, Singapore was the backdrop for the first-ever summit between the leaders of the US and North Korea. Before that, in 2015, we facilitated the landmark meeting between the presidents of China and Taiwan."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00686,2023-11-06-T-011,686,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Lastly, our thinktanks, like the Middle East Institute, could play host to more Track 2 economic exchanges and business forums between the Israelis and Palestinians. These less formal dialogues are essential in building understanding and sharing Singapore's experiences in nation-building."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00687,2023-11-06-T-011,687,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to Singaporeans, especially residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Sengkang, who have actively engaged with WP Members of Parliament on this issue."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00688,2023-11-06-T-011,688,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Your passion, concern and call for a more balanced, humane approach have been instrumental in shaping our collective voice on this matter. Let us unite in supporting efforts that foster peace, dialogue and understanding."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00689,2023-11-06-T-011,689,Gerald Giam Yean Song,I am mindful of the potential influence of misinformation surrounding this conflict. There have been various reports of supposed atrocities committed by both sides. Many such reports remain contested and lack independent verification.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00690,2023-11-06-T-011,690,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"It is important to acknowledge that there is a possibility that some information might be a product of war propaganda. There are significant challenges faced by journalists in independently confirming these allegations, given the hazards of reporting from a conflict zone."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00691,2023-11-06-T-011,691,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"As Singaporeans, it is imperative that we individually take the initiative to guard against the spread of misinformation and disinformation. We should not look to the Government to censor fake news for us."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00692,2023-11-06-T-011,692,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"As an article on the website, Vox, advised, if a video, photo or post about the war makes you immediately furious or upset, refrain from instantly sharing it. Check the source by reviewing the account and its past posts and cross-reference it with reliable news outlets. This will help keep our discourse on this issue rational and focused on what is the most important – the welfare of innocent civilians in Israel and Palestine."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00693,2023-11-06-T-011,693,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Political debate occurring within Parliament, in classrooms or at the Speakers' Corner provides Singaporeans with a safe avenue to express their views and engage in discussions about international conflicts, including about the Israel-Palestine situation. They also provide a crucial pressure release valve for discontent, helping to prevent individuals from becoming overly influenced by extreme rhetoric from foreign sources."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00694,2023-11-06-T-011,694,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Suppressing political debates does not prevent extremism. Rather, it could lead to the debate being driven into radicalised corners of the Internet, which is where the real danger lies."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00695,2023-11-06-T-011,695,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Arguments against greater public debate have often cited concerns about a general lack of understanding surrounding the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This raises two critical questions. What active steps are being taken to deepen Singaporeans' understanding of the conflict? Are we, as individuals, proactively seeking to educate ourselves on this topic?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00696,2023-11-06-T-011,696,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Schools and Institutions of Higher Education should more actively promote classroom discussions on this topic. This will not only provide young people with a platform to voice their perspectives and express their frustrations with the situation but also encourage them to respect different viewpoints. With teachers or facilitators guiding these discussions, the conversations will be kept balanced and will avoid becoming overly contentious."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00697,2023-11-06-T-011,697,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In our era, where information is widely accessible, there is no excuse for not acquiring a basic grasp of this important issue. Despite its complexity, it is essential for each of us to make the effort to understand its nuances so as to foster rational and informed public discussions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00698,2023-11-06-T-011,698,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, in summary, the WP calls for an immediate humanitarian truce, the protection of civilians and aid workers, direct humanitarian access, the swift release of hostages and a return to negotiations towards a two-state solution to the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, in line with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES10/21."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00699,2023-11-06-T-011,699,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00700,2023-11-06-T-011,700,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00701,2023-11-06-T-011,701,Saktiandi Supaat,"While the conflict is miles away from Singapore, we cannot help but mourn the heart-wrenching violence against innocent civilians, including children, on both sides of the conflict. I echo fellow Parliamentary colleagues who have given their speeches earlier and express my deepest condolences to all innocent victims and civilian casualties and their families."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00702,2023-11-06-T-011,702,Saktiandi Supaat,"I have been encouraged by the views of some residents I have engaged in my closed-door chats and dialogues with them on this issue in the past week and would like to voice some of their perspectives in Parliament on this Motion. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00703,2023-11-06-T-011,703,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Many of us in the Malay/Muslim community have heavy hearts regarding plight of the Palestine people. It was reported in the news that some of us are feeling a ""real sense of helplessness"". The community is experiencing difficult emotions, as we hear daily about the powerless Palestinians suffering through the disproportionate, aggressive actions by both parties in the conflict."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00704,2023-11-06-T-011,704,Saktiandi Supaat,"It is understandable, when they see the news and social media posts, and are disturbed by hospitals and places of worship in Gaza being bombed and destroyed. I have residents who are concerned and have asked if these actions comply with international humanitarian law in war. So, I agree with the Motion – (e) calling on all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law, including ensuring the safety and security of civilians, release all civilian hostages and minimize the effects of combat on the civilian population."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00705,2023-11-06-T-011,705,Saktiandi Supaat,"My residents, both Muslims and non-Muslims, have also shared that there is misinformation spreading on social media and WhatsApp on the conflict. Worse, I am concerned of divisive voices online using it for incitement or hate speech against other religions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00706,2023-11-06-T-011,706,Saktiandi Supaat,"As a Singaporean, I am proud of the way that the outpouring of sympathy for those suffering is largely done in constructively and calmly. We should all understand the complex context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and know the facts, before forwarding such messages to our family members and friends."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00707,2023-11-06-T-011,707,Saktiandi Supaat,"I hope that we can continue to perform supplication and our solat hajat special prayers for peace and alleviation of their suffering. In Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, mosques such as Masjid Omar Salmah and Masjid Muhajirin have held special prayers on 20 October, following the call of encouragement by MUIS and the Office of the Mufti to conduct recitation of the supplication Qunut Nazilah, as well as special supplication during the Friday sermon and prayers. I have attended Friday prayers in which these prayers were done since early October. MUIS has also worked with Muslim.sg to offer religious guidance on appropriate responses to this conflict and will soon be issuing an irsyad (guidance)."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00708,2023-11-06-T-011,708,Saktiandi Supaat,"During my recent dialogue with a group of Toa Payoh East residents, both young and old, several residents asked how each resident can help in terms of providing donations through the right channels, that is, the mosques, the UN and also how to receive the correct information through the Government. One resident even asked if we could send our SCDF Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) personnel to conduct search and rescue operation, similar to the help provided in response to the Türkiye-Syria earthquake in February this year. I said that we should focus on providing the basic needs like water, food and medical supplies to the civilians in Israel-Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00709,2023-11-06-T-011,709,Saktiandi Supaat,"This clearly demonstrates the compassion and concern of my residents regardless of race or religion for those affected in Gaza, even though an SCDF effort in a war-torn area might not be possible. I shared that all of us can provide immediate assistance to the Palestinian victims through the various accredited charities that are raising funds for aid to Gaza. For example, Islamic Relief, the Singapore Red Cross and RLAF are running ongoing fund collections. I am proud of the local community's speedy and generous response to RLAF's fund collection efforts, raising more than S$4.6 million in only 2 weeks, as mentioned earlier by my Parliamentary colleague Ms Nadia."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00710,2023-11-06-T-011,710,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In English) I will now speak in English, Mr Speaker, on what I hope the Government will do and take next steps."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00711,2023-11-06-T-011,711,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I had the opportunity to hear various feedback from my youth residents and volunteers in Toa Payoh East, all of whom hail from diverse backgrounds. Despite the difference in views on the issue, all of them found common ground in condemning the use of violence and are concerned with the needless loss of civilian lives, particularly those of children. To that end, some of these youths have expressed willingness to contribute to numerous calls for aid within the community."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00712,2023-11-06-T-011,712,Saktiandi Supaat,"Similar to the feedback raised by my Muslim residents, the youths also brought up a few points of concern, chief of which is the influence of media, both traditional and social media."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00713,2023-11-06-T-011,713,Saktiandi Supaat,"I note that different media channels seem to report different aspects of the conflict and, sometimes, with a subjective spin. Such is evident in the various feedback I have gathered, where I enquired about how opinions are formed and what the source of their information is."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00714,2023-11-06-T-011,714,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, beyond this conflict, we should be worried about how different segments of the community receive their news and how they are able to differentiate between the facts and subjective views. This is important as false information has dire consequences for the unity of our country and how we function as a nation."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00715,2023-11-06-T-011,715,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, many of my residents in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, including non-Malay/Muslim residents, have appealed to me, similar to other Parliamentary colleagues in our community dialogues and emails, that this heart-rending conflict must stop as soon as possible."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00716,2023-11-06-T-011,716,Saktiandi Supaat,"As such, for a start, I support the Motion's limb (b), which calls for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00717,2023-11-06-T-011,717,Saktiandi Supaat,"While the politics of the region are extremely fraught and complex, Singapore must continue to urge all parties involved to prioritise and protect human life and seek political concessions at the bargaining table rather than through warfare. All parties must abide by international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00718,2023-11-06-T-011,718,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am glad that the Singapore Government has voted to support the resolution on the ""Protection of Civilians and Upholding Legal and Humanitarian Obligations"" at the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 27 October while also condemning unequivocally the acts of terror and abhorrent deeds that parties in the conflict have done and which cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00719,2023-11-06-T-011,719,Saktiandi Supaat,"As a society, we must embrace the principles behind which Singapore supported the resolution, most importantly, that all innocent civilian lives on both sides of the conflict must be protected."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00720,2023-11-06-T-011,720,Saktiandi Supaat,"So, I hope the Government can update the House on what further measures, such as in the realm of diplomacy, that Singapore is taking to expedite the protection of innocent civilian lives and the provision of humanitarian assistance. How has the Government ensured that the $300,000 it has donated in aid so far will be going to the right local organisations instead of fuelling the ongoing conflict?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00721,2023-11-06-T-011,721,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, per the Motion, I also reiterate Singapore's long-standing commitment to a negotiated two-state solution consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. I refer to the Arab Barometer survey of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza in early October this year, where the majority of Gazans surveyed also favoured a two-state solution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00722,2023-11-06-T-011,722,Saktiandi Supaat,"A former Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Salam Fayyad, has suggested in an article published in the Foreign Affairs magazine on 27 October, that the way ahead for peace would include formal Israeli recognition of the Palestinians' right to a sovereign state on Israeli-occupied territory. Most crucially, he has suggested for these to be underpinned by an ironclad mutual commitment to non-violence."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00723,2023-11-06-T-011,723,Saktiandi Supaat,I hope the Singapore Government can share its further plans to support the international community's efforts to broker a just and lasting peace between the parties involved.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00724,2023-11-06-T-011,724,Saktiandi Supaat,"Before I end, I would like to speak a bit on the economic ramifications for Singapore. The impact of a protracted conflict in Gaza, and if it spreads or worsens, will have economic and financial ramifications globally. As it stands now, the Israel-Hamas conflict adds another layer of complexity to the geopolitics of the world and existing economic headwinds. Singapore will not be immune. Economists have sounded concerns that an escalation in the fighting between Israel and Hamas could possibly tip the world into recession in a worst-case scenario."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00725,2023-11-06-T-011,725,Saktiandi Supaat,"Though it is still early to raise concern about global output effects, there are key risks for global energy and key commodity prices. Similar to the Russia-Ukraine war, major conflict in the Middle East could have far-reaching price effects across a range of commodity prices. All these will lead to negative externalities and impact on prices here in Singapore in no time, even though it is so far away from us at the moment. So, it is in our interest too to ensure this conflict is not prolonged, not just importantly to save innocent lives, but also to protect the welfare of Singaporeans going forward."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00726,2023-11-06-T-011,726,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we must lend our support to the Palestinian people, who are caught between great powers and the dangerous means used by both sides in the conflict. They do not deserve to live in tragedy, generation after generation. I urge the Singaporean Government to step up our efforts to do more on the diplomatic front to help realise political solutions to the ongoing conflict. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Singapore Cabinet and the Government for taking a principled stand on this issue and for supporting the resolution on the ""Protection of Civilians and Upholding Legal and Humanitarian Obligations"" at the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 27 October. It bodes well for Singapore and it is not an easy decision but I would like to say thank you. We should also provide aid where we can, via the right channels, and I hope the authorities can help guide on these next steps. But most importantly, I urge all efforts to ensure that all innocent civilians, especially the children, must be protected."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00727,2023-11-06-T-011,727,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am confident that Singaporeans will continue to be resilient and harmonious in the face of these issues and band together to help those in need, as we weather any global geo-political and economic storms ahead. Sir, I support the Motion. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00728,2023-11-06-T-011,728,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00729,2023-11-06-T-011,729,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) supports the Motion brought to this House by hon Member Vikram Nair and also the amendments by hon Member Alex Yam today."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00730,2023-11-06-T-011,730,Leong Mun Wai,"Like many Singaporeans, the PSP is distressed and saddened by the tragic violence and loss of life in Israel and the Gaza Strip since Hamas launched its attacks in Southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent retaliatory military actions taken by Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00731,2023-11-06-T-011,731,Leong Mun Wai,"We unequivocally condemn the violence committed by both sides against innocent civilians, especially women and children. The lives of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians must be protected."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00732,2023-11-06-T-011,732,Leong Mun Wai,We strongly support the United Nations Resolution ES-10/21 on October 28 calling for a humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip. We call for Hamas to immediately and unconditionally return all civilian hostages safely to their families and to facilitate a ceasefire and for Israel to respond favourably to such a move if it happens.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00733,2023-11-06-T-011,733,Leong Mun Wai,"We call on Israel to comply with international law, including the Geneva Conventions and the UN Charter. Israel must not collectively punish a captive civilian population, nearly half of which are children and teenagers under age 18, in the Gaza Strip. Israel must immediately rescind its order for Palestinian civilians, which includes gravely sick patients in hospitals, and UN staff to evacuate from northern Gaza Strip to southern Gaza Strip."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00734,2023-11-06-T-011,734,Leong Mun Wai,"More than a million Palestinians in Gaza have been internally displaced by the recent conflict. This internal displacement must not be allowed to evolve into a repeat of the Nakba in 1948, when 700,000 Palestinians were permanently displaced from their towns and villages. We must prevent the Palestinians in Gaza from being permanently displaced to Egypt or any other nation."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00735,2023-11-06-T-011,735,Leong Mun Wai,"Even before the recent events, the living conditions in Gaza have been difficult for the Palestinians. Israel must immediately allow all humanitarian aid to be delivered into Gaza and fully restore civilian access to fuel, food, water, medical aid and other basic necessities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00736,2023-11-06-T-011,736,Leong Mun Wai,"PSP supports Singapore's long-held position that just, enduring and comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be based on a two-state solution based on relevant UN Security Resolutions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00737,2023-11-06-T-011,737,Leong Mun Wai,The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a long-standing and complex issue dating back to and beyond the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. It is also an issue that is of interest to the main communities of our society.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00738,2023-11-06-T-011,738,Leong Mun Wai,"We urge the Government to enhance education on the Israeli-Palestinian history in the future so that Singaporeans can have more accurate and complete information on the conflict. This will help to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being swayed by biased, inaccurate or one-sided emotional discourse, which we have seen on both traditional and social media platforms."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00739,2023-11-06-T-011,739,Leong Mun Wai,"We urge Singaporeans from all communities to be mindful of what we say and do regarding this issue, especially on online forums. We all have the responsibility to refrain from engaging in inflammatory rhetoric that could threaten the peace and harmony that we enjoy in Singapore. We call on all Singaporeans to report any signs of potential radicalisation to the authorities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00740,2023-11-06-T-011,740,Leong Mun Wai,"In line with this, PSP rejects any attempts by foreign players to influence Singaporeans or dictate to Singapore what could be done in relation to this conflict. Singapore's position on all our foreign policy and domestic issues should be for Singaporeans to decide only. For country, for people."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00741,2023-11-06-T-011,741,Speaker,Assoc Prof Razwana Begum.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00742,2023-11-06-T-011,742,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, I thank the hon Members Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for raising this Motion. I stand in support of this Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00743,2023-11-06-T-011,743,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"I begin by expressing my deepest sympathies to the innocent victims affected by this conflict, the loss of lives, particularly children and women, is a tragedy that underscores the urgency of our response."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00744,2023-11-06-T-011,744,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"We are addressing a matter that deeply troubles our collective conscience. At a fundamental level, we all recognise that violent extremism is unacceptable. We condemn any ideas or action of individuals or groups who endorse or resort to violence to accomplish thei ideological, religious or political objectives. This includes terrorism and vasrious other types of violence driven by politics or community factors."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00745,2023-11-06-T-011,745,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"I would like to contribute to this discussion by considering the three key concepts that frame this Motion – solidarity, security and peace. These concepts play a significant role in international relation and have a direct impact on the public safety and security of a nation like Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00746,2023-11-06-T-011,746,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"First concept, solidarity. Solidarity refers to the unity, cooperation and support among individuals, groups or nation, especially in times of adversity or when addressing common challenges. It is the sense of shared responsibility and a commitment to working together to achieve common goals."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00747,2023-11-06-T-011,747,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"The sentiments of our public cannot be ignored. The loss of innocent children, women and civilians in conflict touches the hearts of people worldwide, including Singaporeans. It is our duty to represent their concerns on the international stage. By condemning acts of violence, we stand up for the values of justice, compassion and human rights that our citizens hold dear."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00748,2023-11-06-T-011,748,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"We have done this. We stood in solidarity with 119 other countries by voting in favour of the United Stations General Assembly Resolution. As included in the amendment to this Motion, we call for an immediate durable and sustained humanitarian truce, leading to a cessation of hostilities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00749,2023-11-06-T-011,749,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, as Singaporeans, we understand the importance of safeguarding the well-being of our people and it is crucial to extend this compassion to those beyond our borders. Regardless of our background and differences, I believe we stand by our national pledge to be one united people in our reaction to this deepening humanitarian crisis. We recognise that the situation in Gaza is a massive humanitarian crisis and it is commendable that Singaporeans have come together in solidarity as a nation to provide humanitarian aid and donations."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00750,2023-11-06-T-011,750,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Next concept, security. Security in the context of a nation like Singapore encompasses both national and international security. National security refers to the protection of a country's autonomy, territorial integrity and the safety of our citizens. International security, on the other hand, focuses on maintaining peace and stability between nations and preventing conflicts that could have global repercussions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00751,2023-11-06-T-011,751,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, the events in Gaza have raised security considerations around the world and have the potential to cause conflict within our borders. Our commitment to international security and peace is not only a moral duty but a critical step in safeguarding our own nation. By supporting this Motion, we stand firmly against acts of violence and the violation of international laws. Terrorism can never be justified and it is our collective duty to condemn this. In this conflict, we must insist that all parties involved prioritise the safe and security of civilians, release all hostages and minimise the effects of combat on the civilian population."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00752,2023-11-06-T-011,752,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Singapore, as a nation, proudly embraces its multiracial and multi-religious identity. Our racial and religious harmony is one of our greatest strengths and something we must cherish and protect at all costs."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00753,2023-11-06-T-011,753,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Ensuring global security and stability is integral to preserving our racial harmony. Our support for peaceful resolution reflects our commitment to maintaining a world where all nationalities, cultures and religions can strive together."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00754,2023-11-06-T-011,754,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"In terms of the security of our nation, we must remain vigilant and proactive. This entails monitoring, intelligence sharing, community engagement and a strong commitment to countering extremism. It is vital for Singapore to come together irrespective of differences to build a resilient and united front against division, violence and terrorism. By doing so, we can collectively mitigate risks, promote peace and protect our shared values and way of life."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00755,2023-11-06-T-011,755,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Finally, the third concept, peace. Peace is the absence of violence, conflict and the presence of harmony and cooperation. Peace is essential for the stability and prosperity of our nation."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00756,2023-11-06-T-011,756,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"The situation in Gaza is not merely theoretical or a distant concern. We cannot ignore this tragedy. As a nation, we must advocate for a peaceful resolution to this conflict, align with our commitment to a negotiated two-state solution consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00757,2023-11-06-T-011,757,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, this Motion holds great relevance to Singapore's public safety and security. It is directly connected to our racial harmony, our duty to prevent potential security threats and our commitment to voicing the concerns of the general public."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00758,2023-11-06-T-011,758,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Our support for peace and the condemnation of acts of terror resonate not only on the international stage but within our own border. As we reflect on this crisis, let us remember the value of solidarity, security and peace to our nation."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00759,2023-11-06-T-011,759,Speaker,Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00760,2023-11-06-T-011,760,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion in the name of Mr Vikram Nair and as amended by Mr Alex Yam."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00761,2023-11-06-T-011,761,Vivian Balakrishnan,"This conflict occurs thousands of kilometres away and has a long, complicated and often violent history going back thousands of years. But all Singaporeans are horrified, are saddened by this latest escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Anyone with a heart must feel pain when we witness the suffering of fellow human beings – regardless of race, language, religion, ideology or allegiance."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00762,2023-11-06-T-011,762,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Early in the morning of 7 October 2023, Hamas launched several thousand rockets into Israel. At the same time, more than 1,000 militants infiltrated Israeli territory and killed more than 1,400 persons. The victims included innocent civilians at home, many of them asleep, young people attending a concert and several of our fellow ASEAN nationals working on farms. Hamas also abducted more than 200 civilians including senior citizens, women and children, who today are held as hostages in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00763,2023-11-06-T-011,763,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Let me be clear and unambiguous  what Hamas did on 7 October was an act of terrorism and it involved indiscriminate killing and extreme brutality. It was not a military operation, targeted at military targets. Such acts cannot be justified by any rationale, any historical grievance, any religious belief, any context. These acts of indiscriminate killing, torture and kidnapping of innocent civilians are acts of terror. Period."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00764,2023-11-06-T-011,764,Vivian Balakrishnan,"This is why Singapore has strongly condemned the terrorist attack by Hamas and why we have called for the safe, immediate and unconditional release of all civilian hostages. It is in our absolute national interest to hold fast to this stand, not just because we feel sorry for innocent victims, but because our national interests are at stake. Being so small, exposed, vulnerable, multiracial. Singapore must take a clear and unambiguous stand against terrorism in all circumstances."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00765,2023-11-06-T-011,765,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I was somewhat reassured when I listened to the Leader of the Opposition's speech just now, where he now seems to have clarified that the attack that was launched by Hamas was not simply a military operation, but in fact, deserves to be condemned. I think Mr Gerald Giam was even more specific. I think you used the word ""unequivocally condemn"" the attacks by Hamas."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00766,2023-11-06-T-011,766,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I could not help noticing that both Members of the WP were unable to use the word terrorism, I will leave that for you to clarify later on. But I must share with you that when I first saw your published statement, it left room for ambiguity. I think your speeches in this Chamber today are more reassuring, but I would feel even better if you can clearly and unequivocally say indiscriminate attacks on civilians, on women, on children and taking hostages is a clear and present act of terror, and say that for the sake of Singapore and Singaporeans."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00767,2023-11-06-T-011,767,Vivian Balakrishnan,"These attacks have obviously deeply shaken the Israelis' sense of safety and security. We now know that Israel has responded by launching an intensive aerial bombardment on Gaza. It imposed a blockade on the delivery of food, water and fuel supplies. On 28 October, Israeli troops expanded their ground operations in Gaza to destroy Hamas' military capacity and its vast network of underground tunnels, much of which, it is alleged, is located under civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00768,2023-11-06-T-011,768,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Israel's intensive bombardment and blockade has caused a massive humanitarian crisis in Gaza. To date, health authorities in Gaza have estimated that more than 9,000 Palestinians, including many women and children in Gaza have died, many more have suffered injuries and over 1.5 million would have been displaced from their homes without adequate shelter, food, water or medical attention."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00769,2023-11-06-T-011,769,Vivian Balakrishnan,"At the 10th UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session on 27 October 2023, Singapore voted for a humanitarian truce so that immediate and sustained humanitarian provision of essential supplies and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip can be provided. I think Members have a copy of that resolution that we voted for, including the explanation of vote by our Permanent Representative, Mr Burhan Gafoor, which again, made the point that there were glaring omissions in that resolution, to call out Hamas for conducting an act of terror and for not acknowledging the right of self-defence on the part of Israel, which I will explain a little bit more later on."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00770,2023-11-06-T-011,770,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, let me take this opportunity to explain the principles underpinning the Singapore Government's position on this unfolding tragedy."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00771,2023-11-06-T-011,771,Vivian Balakrishnan,"First, Singapore must and must always take a zero-tolerance approach towards terrorism. We have to be categorical in rejecting terrorism, whoever, whenever, wherever it is perpetrated. And as I said just now, we do so not just out of sympathy, but because terrorism is a clear and present danger and threat for Singapore and Singaporeans."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00772,2023-11-06-T-011,772,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Second, international law dictates that all states have the legitimate and inherent right to defend themselves. This is enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. I do not think I need to remind this House that this is a very important principle for Singapore. Have no doubt – if Singapore is ever attacked, we would certainly assert and exercise the right of self-defence."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00773,2023-11-06-T-011,773,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Third, all countries must ensure that if military action is taken in exercising this right of self-defence, they must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality. They must also comply with the laws of war, including the principle of distinction and humanity enshrined in the Geneva Conventions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00774,2023-11-06-T-011,774,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In such times like this, it is crucial that decisions are not made out of anger, blind wrath and hatred, but are made in line with moral values and legal principles that shape our common humanity. In a jointly written Financial Times commentary last month, a group of distinguished Jewish jurists – and these include experts in international humanitarian law – they strongly counselled Israel and its leaders to act in a restrained and thoughtful way that would not make the country's problems worse. One of these jurists, in fact, included Lord David Neuberger, who was the former President of the Supreme Court of the UK."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00775,2023-11-06-T-011,775,Vivian Balakrishnan,"It is worth quoting them. Let me quote one whole paragraph in full  ""International law forbids sieges of civilian populations. Gaza is home to some two million fellow human beings (almost half of whom are children) and it would be a grave violation of international law to hold them under siege and while doing so deprive them of basic necessities such as food and water. To be clear, collective punishment is prohibited by the laws of war. Equally, international law requires combatants to ensure minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure. An intent to cause indiscriminate damage, rather than behaving in a precise manner to minimise damage would, if established, constitute a grave violation of international law. In the conduct of any military campaign, politicians and commanders alike must be careful to ensure that their words do not imply to their troops that the laws of war can be disregarded, nor employ language whose effect is to dehumanise a civilian population."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00776,2023-11-06-T-011,776,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I want to emphasise that last sentence, ""to dehumanise a civilian population"", because usually, that is a very clear indication that conflict between countries, states or civilisations is about to begin. And the moment that human beings can dehumanise the other is the time when unspeakable horror, barbarity and terrorism is conducted."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00777,2023-11-06-T-011,777,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Any alleged violation of international humanitarian law in this conflict should therefore be investigated in accordance with international law. I think Member of Parliament, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim had asked that question earlier. Yes, we will support the investigation of all allegations after the war in accordance with international law and we hope that all parties will cooperate in these investigations."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00778,2023-11-06-T-011,778,Vivian Balakrishnan,"History will judge each party's response not only by whether and how immediate threats are resolved, but also by the effects on the long-term stability and security of the region."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00779,2023-11-06-T-011,779,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Fourth, humanitarian assistance must reach the affected civilian populations immediately. That is why we call on all parties to enable this, particularly, Israel and Egypt which have immediate borders with Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00780,2023-11-06-T-011,780,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Yesterday, I spoke to the Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Frankly, he was tired, almost demoralised. I told him Singapore understands the tremendous strain that Egypt, as an immediate neighbour, faces. I said we want to support you, we have our people in Singapore who care, we are raising funds, and let us know how we can assist Egypt. I commended the Egyptian government's efforts to open the Rafah crossing to facilitate the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza, and equally, the possible evacuation of seriously injured persons for medical treatment."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00781,2023-11-06-T-011,781,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The day before, I had spoken to the Foreign Minister of the UAE, who was also trying to work out plans, perhaps, to evacuate injured children and their families for treatment elsewhere."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00782,2023-11-06-T-011,782,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We strongly support all these efforts by their immediate neighbours, as well as by the UN and all the other relief organisations to increase aid to Gaza. I think Members are all aware that the Singapore Government contributed seed funding of about $300,000 to the Singapore Red Cross, which is working with its partners to support the relief efforts in Gaza and working closely with the Palestine Red Crescent Society, the Egyptian Red Crescent Society."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00783,2023-11-06-T-011,783,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In fact, right now, I think Singaporeans have donated nearly $5 million to the fundraising drives by the SRC and the RLAF. In fact, I am sure more will come in in the weeks to come. Later tonight, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman will be leaving. He will be going to Cairo. He will also help to ensure facilitation and that the goodness of the hearts of Singaporeans will be directed through the right channels. He will explain a little bit more after my speech."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00784,2023-11-06-T-011,784,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Fifth point, Singapore continues to uphold our long-standing and consistent position that a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, especially 242 and 338, that a two-state solution is the only viable option for a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We have consistently stated for a long time that Israel must accept a Palestinian state, just as Palestinians must also accept Israel's right to exist. We have expressed our firm opposition to violations of international law and to unilateral measures which imperil the prospects for peace."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00785,2023-11-06-T-011,785,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Many of you know that we have got good relations with Israel. I hope you also know that we have good relations with the Palestinian people and with the Palestinian Authority. But look at our voting record in the United Nations. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israeli forces occupied the Old City of Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank after Jordan attacked Israel. In 1967 – some Members of this House were not born yet – following the war, we voted in support of all the UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions calling on Israel to rescind unilateral measures taken to change the status of Jerusalem. We voted again, like this, in 2017. We have also voted in support of UNGA resolutions that reject Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00786,2023-11-06-T-011,786,Vivian Balakrishnan,"With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute a list illustrating Singapore's past voting positions at the United Nations?	Members can also access the handout through the MP@SGPARL App."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00787,2023-11-06-T-011,787,Speaker,Please proceed.  [
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00788,2023-11-06-T-011,788,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Thank you. The point is, we are good friends. But good friends also speak truth, even if it is disagreeable and not the most comfortable to the person on the other side. And our ability to speak truth to friends and to be friends to both sides, even while they are locked in mortal conflict, is a privileged position but one that can only be maintained if we are consistent and we operate on the basis of principles."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00789,2023-11-06-T-011,789,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Unfortunately, the peace process in both Israel and Palestine – and Members have heard a good synopsis on the history by Mr Vikram Nair in his opening speech, I hope you paid attention to it – but the upshot of that process—first, I would remind all Members that being a peacemaker in the Middle East is dangerous. Mr Vikram Nair mentioned President Anwar Sadat. When he made peace with Israel in Camp David, I think they signed it in 1978; by 1981, he was assassinated."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00790,2023-11-06-T-011,790,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In Israel, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in fact, was the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Chief-of-Staff during the 1967 war. So, this is no dove. This is a realist, a General, a Commander and a soldier. Mr Vikram Nair reminded us that it was Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yasser Arafat who signed the Oslo Accords in 1993, and subsequently a second round in 1995. In fact, this is what has led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority. It led to the Israelis pulling out of Gaza. But, as you all would know, Mr Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in November 1999, not by an Arab, but by an Israeli extremist."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00791,2023-11-06-T-011,791,Vivian Balakrishnan,"As for the Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority consisted initially of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) because, in fact, the Olso Accords provided, for the first time ever, the PLO recognised Israel's right to exist and the Israelis recognised the PLO as a representative of the Palestinians. But soon, fierce political rivalry between Hamas and Fatah occurred. In fact, it was not just a matter of elections and ""you win"" and ""I win""; it was actually civil war, violence. They killed each other. The rise of the radical hard-right extremists in both societies, in fact, have made a peaceful political settlement almost impossible. We sit here or stand here and talk about a two-state solution. But we are talking. That is where the frontline is. And actually support for a two-state negotiated political solution has been dropping, waning in both those societies. In fact, in a very perverse way, the extremist right-wing in both Israel and amongst the Palestinians believe in a ""one-state solution"". But if you think about it, a one-state solution, by definition, means the violent elimination of the other."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00792,2023-11-06-T-011,792,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, I am making the point this is difficult, this is complicated and we should respect that difficulty. Nevertheless, it is our sincere hope that, over time, both sides will muster the political will. In fact, I should digress, they need the political leadership with the conviction, the courage and the political capital, which they are willing to expend in order to make a two-state solution a reality. And if they do not, then they are doomed to repeat the cycles of violence."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00793,2023-11-06-T-011,793,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, in the meantime, we will continue to engage the Palestinian Authority. We will support their capacity-building efforts through the Enhanced Technical Assistance Package. We have regular high-level exchanges and visits with the Palestinian Authority, which have allowed us to meet them, hear them and discuss issues with them candidly. The Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh visited Singapore last year whilst Prime Minister Lee, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, Minister Mohamad Maliki Osman and I have visited Ramallah, in fact, on more than one occasion. We opened our Singapore Representative Office in Ramallah in 2022."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00794,2023-11-06-T-011,794,Vivian Balakrishnan,"My sixth point is that we must not allow external political events, painful as they are, to divide us in Singapore. Yesterday, the Prime Minister reminded us this is not our quarrel. This is a quarrel amongst our friends outside. Our job is to be sympathetic, compassionate, to speak truth to them, to be helpful, but not to pour oil on the fire. And bear in mind, actually, both sides claim to be the children of Abraham. This is the ultimate example of sibling fratricide."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00795,2023-11-06-T-011,795,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Both sides have suffered tragic losses and they deserve our sympathy and support. But come back now to Singapore and be very wary and careful in how we reflect our compassion, our principles, our values. Understand that strong emotions are engaged, but we must not fall prey to what we see in other countries where strong emotions have led to violent clashes, to hate speech and to exclusion. And as many of you have illustrated, often fueled by disinformation. Our religious and racial harmony is very precious. We must not allow anything to break this or split our society. And it is heartening that so many of our faith and community leaders strongly feel this, say this and operate on this basis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00796,2023-11-06-T-011,796,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our Muslim community, in particular, have responded in a very restrained, responsible and responsive manner, working in concert with other communities to collectively raise funds for humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The Mufti, Dr Nazirudin Nasir wrote a letter, which I hope every single one of you will read, to express solidarity and support to the Rabbi Mordechai Abergel, who replied in the same spirit. It was an exemplary gesture of goodwill that reflects so well on our religious harmony. But it is actually quite rare in the world for a Mufti and a Rabbi to be able to correspond like that at a moment of tension and high emotion. And I can assure you, the Government had nothing to do with this. But we saw it and approved of it and we should all be grateful to them."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00797,2023-11-06-T-011,797,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Let me also make a secondary point here that it is worth emphasising that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a religious conflict. At its core, the conflict has always been about territory, self-determination and identity, complicated by intra-Palestinian and intra-Israeli domestic politics. And as I have said before, it provides fertile ground for extremists on both sides to misuse religion to further their political aims and we must not fall into their trap."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00798,2023-11-06-T-011,798,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The seventh point is that the safety of Singaporeans abroad is always a priority for us in MFA. On 7 October 2023, we advised Singaporeans to leave Israel and the Palestinian Territories as soon as possible. We reached out to Singaporeans who had registered with MFA and we facilitated the departure of those who needed assistance."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00799,2023-11-06-T-011,799,Vivian Balakrishnan,"But even today, you might be surprised to know that 40 registered Singaporeans remain in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. We do our best to remain in contact with them; they have chosen to remain."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00800,2023-11-06-T-011,800,Vivian Balakrishnan,"More than 120 Singaporeans heeded our advice and left by land or air earlier. While most Singaporeans were able to leave by commercial means, a few who were unable to do so departed via dedicated evacuation flights which were organised by other countries. I need to express our gratitude to the governments of Australia, Canada, Portugal and Korea for helping our Singaporeans to leave Israel safely."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00801,2023-11-06-T-011,801,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, this latest conflagration is just the most recent episode of a complex, long-running conflict in the Middle East. As human beings, we cannot remain detached and inured to human suffering, but we know these cycles of violence will recur unless they come to the nub of the problem."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00802,2023-11-06-T-011,802,Vivian Balakrishnan,"As Singaporeans, we do care and we do care deeply, but this episode is also a reminder to all Singaporeans that we do have our national interests at stake. What are they?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00803,2023-11-06-T-011,803,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We must reject terrorism in all its forms. No excuses, no ifs, no buts, no short-term political advantage. Reject terrorism. If attacked, all of us here must give the government of the day the ability to exercise the right of self-defence. But even when it does so, we will expect the government of the day to uphold international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00804,2023-11-06-T-011,804,Vivian Balakrishnan,"As Singaporeans, we will continue to extend humanitarian assistance and protection to all civilians. We should support the peaceful resolution of disputes. We must nurture and protect our own precious cohesion and harmony. We must never allow conflicts elsewhere to divide us domestically."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00805,2023-11-06-T-011,805,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I am glad that today that my sense of the House is that we have unanimity, we will have consensus in voting for this Motion. I make this appeal as the Minister for Foreign Affairs that our ability to conduct consistent and coherent foreign policy in a very volatile and dangerous world depends on domestic cohesion and consensus."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00806,2023-11-06-T-011,806,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I fully support this amended Motion. I thank Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and I call on all Members of Parliament, regardless of party, to support this Motion and to uphold these principles which are essential for Singapore's survival. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00807,2023-11-06-T-011,807,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00808,2023-11-06-T-011,808,Pritam Singh,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I rise to clarify some remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, specifically, his comment about the WP's statement of 18 October. I think, the Minister, correct me if I am wrong, the Minister was, for lack of a better word, curious why the words ""terrorist attack"" were not in our statement."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00809,2023-11-06-T-011,809,Pritam Singh,"The focus of our statement was to emphasise that whether it is Hamas, whether it is Israel, killing of non-combatants, women, children, by any country or organisation, deserves no less than absolute condemnation."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00810,2023-11-06-T-011,810,Pritam Singh,"I thought that would have made it clear that we were taking a very even-keeled approach to this matter, that on the one hand, the terrorist attacks are not to be condoned; on the other hand, when you have matters such as Israeli settlers evicting Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank – even today, it is happening today – that also ought to be condemned. I hope the Minister can agree that there has to be an even-handed approach to this."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00811,2023-11-06-T-011,811,Pritam Singh,"My second point, perhaps explaining why the use of that word ""terrorism"" was not activated so readily but more of a balanced approach in our statement was what we sought to put forward – is with regard to Singapore's approach on the labelling of organisations or terrorist designations on certain groups."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00812,2023-11-06-T-011,812,Pritam Singh,I understand Singapore has an Inter-Ministry Committee on Terrorist Designation (IMC-TD). It is the authority of the designation of terrorist groups and groupings. The Government relies on this committee to determine which organisation is labelled accordingly and then this is legislatively captured in the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act 2002.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00813,2023-11-06-T-011,813,Pritam Singh,My understanding is that Hamas is not on that list. Maybe the Minister can explain that position for the understanding of the general public.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00814,2023-11-06-T-011,814,Pritam Singh,"My final point relates to something which was originally said by Mr Alex Yam. The Minister also made the same point by way of the document that has been released to Members, where he said that Singapore has been consistent in its stand on matters concerning Israel and Palestine. I take the point. But I had a quick look at statements that were made by Mr Lee Kuan Yew over the years. I referred to him in my speech. I also noted what he said in his memoirs."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00815,2023-11-06-T-011,815,Pritam Singh,"He spoke of the Six-Day War and I am quoting from his memoirs, ""When the UN General Assembly was debating the resolution to condemn Israel, Rajaratnam, our Foreign Minister and Afro-Asian champion, was all for it. Keng Swee saw me to press Raja to direct our UN delegate not to avoid in favour of the resolution or the Israelis would leave."" By ""the Israelis would leave"", he is referring to the Israeli advisors who were here in assisting the build-up of the Singapore Armed Forces."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00816,2023-11-06-T-011,816,Pritam Singh,"Thereafter, Mr Lee said, ""As I could not attend the Cabinet meeting, I stated my position in a note. We had to stand up for the right of small nations to exist."" And he goes on, ""I added that I did not believe the Israeli advisors would leave even if we were to vote for the Afro-Asian resolution. I was in favour of abstaining in the vote. The Cabinet agreed with my view. We abstained and the Israelis did not leave."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00817,2023-11-06-T-011,817,Pritam Singh,"So, I just wanted to clarify because the handout says we voted ""Yes"" for all these emergency special session resolutions. It may well be that the resolution Mr Lee is referring to is a different one, but I am just making that point to clarify what the Minister has put out in his statement."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00818,2023-11-06-T-011,818,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I just want to, I suppose, double confirm on the actions that Hamas conducted on 7 October targeting innocent civilians at home, killing women, children and taking hostages – is the WP's position that those are acts of terrorism? ["
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00819,2023-11-06-T-011,819,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Sir, I will reflect that the Member has confirmed. And Mr Gerald Giam, same? They are acts of terror."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00820,2023-11-06-T-011,820,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, that is why I said I was more reassured, Mr Speaker, after listening to both of them, because the initial statement did leave some room for doubt and ambiguity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00821,2023-11-06-T-011,821,Vivian Balakrishnan,"My conclusion from this recent confirmation is that actually, you stand four-square with us, with the Motion and with the Government's position. I want to welcome that because, again, the arguments on foreign policy must stop at our shores. And on something as vital as terrorism, we cannot afford to have political parties trying to outflank each other in order to fish for votes."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00822,2023-11-06-T-011,822,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, I am grateful for the WP's confirmation that you stand on this issue, that what happened on that day was a terrorist act, deserves unequivocal condemnation. And I think PSP has also made its position clear."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00823,2023-11-06-T-011,823,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The second line of queries about terrorists' designation. Generally, different countries have different ways of designating. The United States and the European Union (EU) have their list of terrorist organisations. The UN generally works on the basis of what is designated by the Security Council."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00824,2023-11-06-T-011,824,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In Singapore, we do have a committee. This is primarily a security committee. What we are looking out for are acts of terrorism, financing of terrorism. Whether someone or some organisation is or is not on a list in the UN or some other country is just one factor under consideration. There is that old saying, ""If it walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, it is a duck."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00825,2023-11-06-T-011,825,Vivian Balakrishnan,I think I have to ask you to trust our security agencies that they know what activities and plans people are up to and where that money is going to. And we do not hesitate to act. It is not a binary switch – you are on the list or you are not on the list. You notice that I have been also very careful to say what I am asking you to confirm today is that the actions of 7 October were acts of terror.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00826,2023-11-06-T-011,826,Vivian Balakrishnan,"If you want to go further back in history, I have made the point earlier that yes, it is not a secret that we do have a good relationship with Israel. But a good relationship does not mean we have to agree with everything they do nor are we apologists for what they do."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00827,2023-11-06-T-011,827,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Specifically, on the issues of occupied territories and settlements, as far as I know, I stand ready to be corrected, we have voted in favour of every resolution that has said that they should not be building settlements in occupied territories. It is worth remembering, to come back to Gaza, that in fact 18 years ago, Israel had to deploy its own military forces in Gaza to force its settlers out of Gaza, 18 years ago."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00828,2023-11-06-T-011,828,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I said just now, Maliki and myself have been to Ramallah a couple of times. Yes, there is a problem in the West Bank, because of the progressive settlements, which make it very difficult for any future settlement."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00829,2023-11-06-T-011,829,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, yes, Mr Singh, we do vote regularly at the UN in a way which does not please the Israelis, but we have a good relationship based on respect. They know why we take the stand we take."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00830,2023-11-06-T-011,830,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The larger point I want to make to Members of this Houses is that it is why it is so important to operate by principles and to consistently operate by principles. Because from time to time, whoever is on this side of the House will have to say ""no"". ""No"" to a superpower, ""no"" to a friend who has been there at a time when we were very vulnerable and needed help."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00831,2023-11-06-T-011,831,Vivian Balakrishnan,"But without that sense of principle and that consistent adherence to principle, we will make life much more difficult for our country. And the conduct of foreign policy, like I said, will become a very much more dangerous enterprise than it is now."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00832,2023-11-06-T-011,832,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Frankly, for this matter, the foreign policy aspects of it are not difficult. We know what to do. We know how to vote. We know what to say. We can put out correct statements. That is not rocket science."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00833,2023-11-06-T-011,833,Vivian Balakrishnan,The real challenge – the real political challenge – is domestic. That is why I have been so keen and listening for the support from Members of Parliament of all parties and from the Nominated Members of Parliament as well for this Motion.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00834,2023-11-06-T-011,834,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00835,2023-11-06-T-011,835,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just wanted to get a sense from the Minister as I put in my original set of clarifications, how would he characterise what happened in the occupied territories? I think that is important for a more balanced perspective to this issue. And I think it is important that the Government sets its view out as well."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00836,2023-11-06-T-011,836,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I think I stated it just now and I would put out our voting record at the UN. It is Exhibit A. Our view is that those settlements should not be there. If you go by the votes in the Security Council, they breach international law. You do not need to ask me for that. That is on the record."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00837,2023-11-06-T-011,837,Speaker,Mr Vikram Nair.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00838,2023-11-06-T-011,838,Vikram Nair,I just wish to pick up on one point that the Leader of the Opposition made. I think his explanation for not calling out the acts of terrorism in the initial statement was that Hamas was not a listed organisation under the Terrorism Suppression of Financing Act.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00839,2023-11-06-T-011,839,Vikram Nair,"I had a look at the Act. There was a Schedule of the Act and Hamas is not in that Schedule, but ""terrorist entity"" means any entity owned or controlled by any terrorist group or group of terrorists and includes an association of such entities set out in the First Schedule. The First Schedule is not exclusive. So, if Hamas is not on the list, it does not mean that it is not a terrorist entity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00840,2023-11-06-T-011,840,Vikram Nair,"The second and more relevant point is that that Act sets out the definition of a terrorist act. And a terrorist act is clearly defined as one that involves serious violence against a person, involves serious damage of property, or endangers a person's life. There are other limbs but these three are the most material."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00841,2023-11-06-T-011,841,Vikram Nair,"If that is satisfied, in addition to that, where the threat or use of violence is reasonably regarded or intending to influence or compel government or any other government or any international organisations to do or refrain from doing any act or intimidate the public or public servant or the public, then it is an act of terrorism."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00842,2023-11-06-T-011,842,Vikram Nair,"So, to me, all the components are satisfied. There is direct violence, there is intention to compel government – the definition of terrorist act is plainly satisfied."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00843,2023-11-06-T-011,843,Speaker,Mr Singh.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00844,2023-11-06-T-011,844,Pritam Singh,"I do not have the Act in front of me right now, but I know we list out specifically what some of these organisations are and the fact is, Hamas is not on that list, notwithstanding the Member's personal views to this particular issue."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00845,2023-11-06-T-011,845,Pritam Singh,"Before he put his view out, he said that our statement did not condemn it because of this particular point, or because of terrorism. I think he may have misunderstood. In our view, at the time the statement was made, a condemnation of both parties was important to us, for different reasons, of course. And so, we captured it in the fourth paragraph of our statement. I hope this clarifies."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00846,2023-11-06-T-011,846,Speaker,Minister Dr Maliki Osman.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00847,2023-11-06-T-011,847,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Motion. In Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00848,2023-11-06-T-011,848,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, like many Singaporeans, I am deeply troubled and saddened by the loss of civilian lives on all sides and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Starting with the shocking attack that took the lives of 1,400 ordinary Israelis, now on a daily basis, we see images of devastation and despair; of the innocent lives lost, including more than 3,700 Palestinian children in Gaza. It is heartbreaking to think about the children who were orphaned because they lost their parents. Understandably, our Muslim community particularly, feel anxious, restless, sad and even angry. How could such atrocity take place? This humanitarian crisis facing the Palestinian people is a truly heartbreaking tragedy. The Government understands the emotions felt and expressed by our Muslim community and other Singaporeans towards the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. The daily rising death toll is of grave concern. We deeply sympathise with the plight and the grief of Palestinian civilians who have lost their loved ones, just as we feel deep sympathy for the grieving families of Israelis killed in the 7 October attacks, although the death toll in Palestine has increased multiple folds. We convey our deepest condolences to the families of all civilians killed and wounded in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00849,2023-11-06-T-011,849,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"However, we need to also understand the present crisis in the context of history. The conflict goes back a long way and is highly complicated. There is always a previous wrong. In this case, Hamas' terrorist attacks on 7 October, which massacred many Israeli civilians. Some have said that the attacks are justified because of the historical grievances of the Palestinians and the treatment they suffered at different times from different governments of Israel, but nothing can justify what Hamas did on 7 October. Therefore, the Singapore Government has strongly condemned Hamas' acts of terror. We have now called for the unconditional, safe and immediate release of all civilians held hostage in Gaza. Israel has the legitimate right within international law to defend its citizens and territory from armed attacks and acts of terror, just like Singapore. But it has to do so in accordance with international humanitarian law. It is the same acts of terror we cannot allow on anyone and more so on our shores."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00850,2023-11-06-T-011,850,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Sir, I have been to Ramallah several times. I have spoken to many Palestinians and their leaders there. Mr Speaker, we feel for the Palestinian people, we know their struggles and we wish that they can live peacefully. They have not been able to live the peace – the same one Singaporeans cherish - for a very long time. Singapore believes in and complies with the rule of law. That lasting peace that Palestine desires must undergo the process of law. Minister Vivian had shared our voting records in the UN on the Palestinian issue from as early as 1967 when Israel occupied Palestine. And most recently, at the resumed 10th UN General Assembly (UNGA) Emergency Special Session on 27 October, Singapore voted for a UNGA resolution which demanded that all parties comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, and to enable immediate and sustained humanitarian access for essential supplies and services to reach all civilians in need in Gaza. The resolution also calls for the immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce, leading to cessation of hostilities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00851,2023-11-06-T-011,851,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Some Members have asked about Singapore's response towards humanitarian aid to Gaza. The Singapore government has also contributed S$300,000 as seed capital to the Singapore Red Cross (SRC). This is the single largest contribution that the Governmen has made to support humanitarian and relief efforts in Gaza. We will consider giving more as the need arises."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00852,2023-11-06-T-011,852,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Singaporeans have largely been careful to not let what is happening overseas affect our social harmony at home, even though our heart goes out to those affected in Gaza. We appreciate both the Muslim and Jewish communities here acting with calm and exercising restraint. Religious leaders like the Mufti and Chief Rabbi expressed sympathy, provided reassurances and gave support to each other. This reflects that our model of co-existence is possible, and as one people, we must do all we can to preserve such social harmony that we have built in Singapore. Seeing the alternative model in the Middle East today, we cannot take for granted what we have achieved today and we must continue to work hard to preserve it."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00853,2023-11-06-T-011,853,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"I am heartened to see that Singaporeans readily stepped forward to contribute generously to the humanitarian relief efforts in various ways. For example, RLAF fundraising appeal, which will be directed to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), has raised over S$4.6 million while the SRC's fundraising campaign has also raised over S$350,000 from the public. We are touched by the generous donations received thus far, which have been heartening, but more importantly, we see Singaporeans' strong spirit of solidarity. Many different community and interfaith groups came together to contribute to RLAF's humanitarian aid and to Gaza. With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute a list of some of our past humanitarian assistance to affected civilians in the Palestinian Territories? Members may also access the handout through the MP@SGPARL App."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00854,2023-11-06-T-011,854,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr. Speaker, I will leave for the Middle East tonight and will go to Egypt to witness the handing over of humanitarian aid from SRC to the Egyptian Red Crescent Society along with the contribution of RLAF to UNRWA for Gaza. I will receive a briefing from these humanitarian organizations on the latest humanitarian situation in Gaza. And I will also take the opportunity to meet and discuss with the Egyptian leaders about opportunities for us to collaborate to help the victims in Gaza. Some Members have also asked about Singapore's relations with the Palestinian Authority (PA). Our relations with the PA are strong. They have recognized the right of Israel to exist and pursue the 2-state solutions that we have supported and we have voted for at the UN. We have engaged the PA leadership at the highest level."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00855,2023-11-06-T-011,855,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Since early 2022, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, Minister Vivian and I have visited Ramallah. Prime Minister Lee also visited Ramallah in 2016, and hosted Palestinian Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Shtayyeh in Singapore in October 2022. We have and will continue to support the PA's capacity-building efforts through the S$10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP). Let me assure the House that the current conflict will not affect Singapore's commitment to supporting the Palestinian people through the ETAP. We welcome PA officials to make study visits to Singapore and participate in courses under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. We also hope for more PA officials to take up available scholarships to pursue their postgraduate studies at Singapore's universities. The Singapore Representative Office in Ramallah continues to operate and will support ETAP."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00856,2023-11-06-T-011,856,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, Singapore has taken a consistent and principled position. Singapore believes that a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant UNSC resolutions, remains the only viable way for Israel and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security. Ultimately, true peace and reconciliation can only occur when both Israeli and Palestinian people commit to a two-state solution. For that to happen, both Israel and the Palestinians need the political will to make the compromises necessary to resolve the conflict that they have been facing. Their people will decide on their respective leaders who, in turn, will decide if and when they can ensure peace will prevail. It should not and must not happen due to pressure from the social media war. Nor is it pressure from any country. Least so by violence, even when it is to avenge violence – that can never be the answer. It will only harden hearts for another generation and make any resolution even more difficult."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00857,2023-11-06-T-011,857,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Difficult as it may be given the current conflict in Gaza, we hope that there will be a time in the future for both sides to enter direct negotiations on the basis of a two-state solution. The perpetual cycle of violence must be broken. As a friend to both Israel and the Palestinians, it is Singapore's sincere hope that peace will ultimately prevail."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00858,2023-11-06-T-011,858,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, please allow me to continue my speech in English."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00859,2023-11-06-T-011,859,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Some Members have asked about the impact of the Israeli-Hamas conflict on Singapore society and the efforts taken to strengthen our religious harmony, including in our educational institutions. As mentioned in my Malay speech earlier, we recognise that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an emotive one for Singaporeans and there may be different viewpoints. Regardless, the peace and harmony that we enjoy in Singapore are precious and many in the House have spoken about this. We have worked hard over the years to build up trust across our different communities at different levels. We all have a duty of care to protect and grow it."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00860,2023-11-06-T-011,860,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"At the leadership level, we have multiple platforms for community leaders to engage with one another frequently and at different settings, such as at the National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony, as well as the Racial and Religious Harmony Circles in every constituency."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00861,2023-11-06-T-011,861,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"At the people-to-people level, MCCY provides support for inter-faith and inter-ethnic dialogues and other initiatives that bring together different communities to respectfully discuss sensitive issues of race and religion. For example  Ask Me Anything  a series of dialogues that educates the public about different faiths in Singapore and seeks to develop inter-faith norms and practices. OnePeople.SG organises Community Dialogues in collaboration with community groups that engage a broad spectrum of participants in robust yet respectful conversations on sensitive issues of race and religion and on social norms and aspirations of the different communities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00862,2023-11-06-T-011,862,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Within the Muslim community, religious leaders and asatizahs play an important role to guide and support the community during this difficult period. They amplified values of Rahmah, or blessings, and called upon the community to embrace compassion, blessings and love for all. This is in line with the principles and values of Islam as ""Blessings for All"". The Mufti has engaged youths at a MuslimSG event on 14 October and provided guidance on how, as Muslims, we should respond and deal with our feelings of grief and anger, which must be guided by the teachings of Islam and being a blessing to all. Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) has also produced a series of Friday sermons that speaks on the need to preserve peace and compassion and the sanctity of human lives, regardless of one's religion and background."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00863,2023-11-06-T-011,863,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Our asatizahs also bring the community together to pray for peace and the cessation of violence, not only in Gaza, but elsewhere. The special prayer, or known as the Hajat Prayer, conducted at more than 50 mosques have attracted over 50,000 congregants. These special prayers not only provide solace for the community to respond to the situation but empower them to pray for peace."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00864,2023-11-06-T-011,864,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Sir, our community responded with maturity and we understand the value of unity amidst this trying period for all of us. We must continue to protect ourselves from being influenced by the barrage of information, misinformation and disinformation that enters our social media platforms as feeds. We have heard calls to boycott F&B establishments. We should not conflate the actions of governments with the operations of business and economics."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00865,2023-11-06-T-011,865,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, our educational institutions are common spaces for students to learn and interact with one another in a safe and respectful manner. As we engage students in understanding global issues, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, we will continue to emphasise Singapore's multicultural context and the importance of preserving our precious racial and religious harmony."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00866,2023-11-06-T-011,866,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Civic literacy, critical thinking, information and media literacy skills have always been emphasised in our national curriculum. With the proliferation of information and diverse views across all forms of media, our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will continue to equip students with the skills necessary to discern fake news and misinformation and build their instinct to read from credible sources and in context."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00867,2023-11-06-T-011,867,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"For students who are trying to understand the ongoing conflict and navigate the multiple perspectives or wish to express their views, schools and IHLs provide a safe environment for them to engage in civil, respectful and balanced discourse and allow different opinions to be voiced and discussed objectively, even while they engage in robust and rigorous debate. Students are reminded to be respectful and constructive during these discussions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00868,2023-11-06-T-011,868,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, we are a diverse people. Some may have personal connections to the developing situation in the Middle East. Some feel strongly about it, understandably. We ought to be mindful and take extra effort to be respectful, sensitive and kind and appreciate their feelings and experiences. However, let us not let these perspectives hurt our relationships and unity in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00869,2023-11-06-T-011,869,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"I am proud of how Singaporeans are responding to the situation. It shows a recognition that we should not let external developments divide Singaporeans. Instead, we can channel our energies constructively to provide practical assistance and, at the same time, appreciating that social harmony in Singapore is hard-earned and that while it may be tested from time to time, we will always come through and stay together as Singaporeans. Let us continue to work together to build up the bonds of trust and harmony in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00870,2023-11-06-T-011,870,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, in line with Singapore's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and our principled support of international law as well as the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, I support the Motion raised by Members of Parliament Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00871,2023-11-06-T-011,871,Speaker,"I wish you safe travels to Egypt tonight, Dr Maliki Osman. Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.45 pm."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00872,2023-11-06-T-011,872,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00873,2023-11-06-T-011,873,Speaker,at 4.25 pm until 4.45 pm.

2023-11-06-T-011-S-00876,2023-11-06-T-011,876,Deputy Speaker,Order. Ms Joan Pereira.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00877,2023-11-06-T-011,877,Joan Pereira,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to focus on the perspectives of our Singaporeans, on the Israel-Hamas situation, as well as on other geopolitical conflicts around the world."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00878,2023-11-06-T-011,878,Joan Pereira,"Each of us care and should care because at the personal level, we are all fellow human beings, and the situation now is that numerous innocent civilian lives have been lost and are still being lost as we speak. In conflicts and wars, humanity loses."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00879,2023-11-06-T-011,879,Joan Pereira,"We need to focus on how we can help save innocent lives and de-escalate the conflict. As Singaporeans, we have a duty to support our country's stance, expressed here in Parliament today. Singaporeans and residents must remain united to uphold our domestic peace, harmony and mutual respect."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00880,2023-11-06-T-011,880,Joan Pereira,"I want to acknowledge the emotions and reactions of all our fellow Singaporeans, which can be very diverse, with some experiencing stronger emotions than others. I am sure that everyone experiences, to varying degrees, the distress and heartache of learning about fellow human lives being lost. As Singaporeans, we treasure a peaceful world, with many of our older generations still holding memories of the trauma of war and the immense amount of blood, sweat and tears required to rebuild a nation. It is with this shared history and destiny that bind all of us, past, present and future Singaporeans. We have to defend this hard-earned multiracial and multi-religious trust, unity and harmony. We should show empathy for the victims of wars elsewhere, but we must never let such conflicts divide us."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00881,2023-11-06-T-011,881,Joan Pereira,"In today's modern warfare that is globally televised, and with social media playing a pivotal role in shaping the world's perceptions of the situation, misinformation and disinformation from supporters of all sides will certainly take place. It has happened and will continue to happen."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00882,2023-11-06-T-011,882,Joan Pereira,"Therefore, our psychological defence is most important. Social media content, in its nature, is designed to rile people up, sustain their interest and become viral. Just like how all of us are learning how to deal with scammers, we must also learn how to resist being influenced and blindly led along by social media in this conflict. We must not play into their hands and we must not let ourselves get dragged into the conflict virtually."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00883,2023-11-06-T-011,883,Joan Pereira,"Beyond the virtual online world, what about in the real world? I want to take this opportunity to talk about the safety and security of Singaporeans who are overseas when emergencies, conflicts or crises strike."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00884,2023-11-06-T-011,884,Joan Pereira,"When the situations in Ukraine and in Israel deteriorated or when borders were closed and flights were cancelled at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were Singaporeans who were on their travels. Thankfully, there were commercial flights still available, while others were able to get to neighbouring countries before flying out, and MFA was also in touch to help those who faced challenges. However, this was not as straightforward as it seemed, because not every Singaporean travelling overseas had eRegistered with MFA before going on their travels and it was always not easy for MFA to trace and get in touch with every Singaporean who may need assistance."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00885,2023-11-06-T-011,885,Joan Pereira,"Many Singaporeans travel overseas, be it to neighbouring countries within Southeast Asia or other destinations further away. How can we get more Singaporeans to eRegister before leaving? While many of my residents told me that they do eRegister before leaving, there are still many who shared me with that they had forgotten to do so on quite a number of trips or felt it was not necessary. I suggest this be a voluntary step to be built into existing immigration and customs processes or more reminders can be put up prominently via QR codes at the airports or border crossings. With that, I support the Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00886,2023-11-06-T-011,886,Deputy Speaker,Dr Syed Harun.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00887,2023-11-06-T-011,887,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I make this speech with a heavy heart, not from a weight of reluctance or hesitation, but from a place of deep anguish and pain."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00888,2023-11-06-T-011,888,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"The conflict is a tragedy unfolding so catastrophically that in barely over a month, more than 10,000 lives have been lost. We see troubling and abhorrent images on both sides; on 7 October from within Israel and then, over the past month, from Gaza. By any measure, it is hard to see an end in sight to this terrible conflict and going by how events have unfolded in the past month, it is clear that more lives will be lost in the coming days to weeks."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00889,2023-11-06-T-011,889,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"It was reported by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that, as of last Saturday, 4 November, Day 29 of the crisis, that among almost the 11,000 fatalities, 31 Israeli children out of 1,400 Israeli fatalities, 3,900 Palestinian children, 2,430 Palestinian women and 572 Palestinian elderly. One point four million have been displaced in Gaza, a land that is half the size of Singapore and, in relative terms, the number of deaths that the conflict has contributed in a mere 29 days and still counting, is fast approaching half of the total deaths that Singapore saw in a full year in 2022. We have yet to consider, Mr Deputy Speaker, the longer-term impact of food security, water and sanitation, health and healthcare, destruction to family units, the impact of education of children and the physical infrastructure damage to housing units, education facilities, hospitals and other buildings are also included in the UN report."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00890,2023-11-06-T-011,890,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"These numbers inform us of a humanitarian crisis and tragedy so deep, protracted and entrenched that it will take years, if not decades, to recover from. I am hopeful for peace and a two-state solution in my lifetime, but certainly, no peace can be had when guns, rockets and airstrikes are still firing from both sides and countless innocent civilians are losing lives on a daily basis. We are not yet sure how much further this crisis could unravel and the destabilising impact that it has in the wider Middle East and other regions of the world."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00891,2023-11-06-T-011,891,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"I support the Government's position, as outlined by Singapore's affirmative vote at the UN General Assembly on 27 October for an ""immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities"", a demand for aid access and a determined protection of civilians."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00892,2023-11-06-T-011,892,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Singapore must continue to push for a ceasefire to come to fruition, for a sustained delivery of humanitarian aid to areas of conflict and to persist in its principled position of unequivocally condemning terrorist acts and violations of international law on both sides, and for the safety and security of civilians, including the release of all hostages."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00893,2023-11-06-T-011,893,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do support the Government's position that a two-state solution remains the only option for peace, but that the final solution also needs to be tempered with what is fair and just for both sides such that peace can be meaningful and lasting."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00894,2023-11-06-T-011,894,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Taking a leaf from the statement by our Ambassador Burhan Gafoor, our Permanent Representative at the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, on 27 October 2023, I quote"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00895,2023-11-06-T-011,895,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"""We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and Israel's right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity. We call on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00896,2023-11-06-T-011,896,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have two proposals for the Government to further consider as part of my contribution to this debate and Motion. It speaks to what both our hon Foreign Ministers have said earlier."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00897,2023-11-06-T-011,897,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"The first takes into account that Singapore is no stranger to difficult conversations, conflict resolution and negotiations. Our stated positions across many conflicting issues on the international stage have been clear and principled, even if it may bring some detriment, disagreement or unhappiness in our relationships with other countries in the short term. The position of trust and honesty at the international stage that Singapore has benefited from could only have been possible because we continue to take consistent principled positions in our dealings and affairs with others and anchored firmly in our prescribed values of justice and equality for all."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00898,2023-11-06-T-011,898,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"In this regard, I would urge the Government to build on the trusted partnership that Singapore has on both sides of the fence of this conflict and take a position of arbitration, if and when the opportunity arises, publicly or otherwise."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00899,2023-11-06-T-011,899,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Depending on how one measures the timeline of this conflict, surely, there are differing historical views and narratives on when this conflict started. However, my view is that learning from history has its benefits and we surely must be introspective about such lessons but only in so far as it does not hold us ransom and hinder current and future prospects of peace."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00900,2023-11-06-T-011,900,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Singapore has shown through examples of her actions internally in our local context and outwardly on the international stage that we have no qualms about proposing and making considered decisions based on what is right rather than what is popular. Being a small country in the global space with little by way of physical resources, our value has been measured through the trust that others have in us. Further to this, our local communities also have an innumerable number of scholars who are familiar with the wider Middle East, its language, culture and history and these are strengths that we can draw upon to facilitate such an involvement in the peace process."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00901,2023-11-06-T-011,901,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Second, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is much that the wider Singapore society and the Government can learn and glean from this conflict. These range from wider issues of international relations relating to foreign diplomacy, deterrence and defence, to internal lessons about how fragile society can be when societal differences are amplified along racial and religious ideologies coupled with a lack political will, stability and ability to achieve peaceful resolution in the longer term. Inadvertently, the ones who suffer most as a result are innocent civilians and the people."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00902,2023-11-06-T-011,902,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"In this regard, given the depth and richness of knowledge that the conflict could offer by way of national education and learning, I was slightly disappointed when it was announced that the topic of this conflict could not be discussed more openly at the Speaker's Corner or as part of events or public assemblies when, in fact, the matter was already widely covered and readily accessible online and in local newspapers."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00903,2023-11-06-T-011,903,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"I can appreciate the initial concerns over public order, the sensitivity of the topic as well as the volatility of the situation overseas, but I do hope that the Government will reconsider this position in good time and I would suggest for this to be allowed sooner rather than later. There should be means for Singapore Citizens to discuss and express their thoughts in a safe space about such delicate issues and raise their own awareness and appreciation of such devastation and atrocities happening around the world."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00904,2023-11-06-T-011,904,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Where there are additional concerns relating to security or public order, such engagements could be done with certain security restrictions or in limited numbers of participants. We should continue to allow for peaceful discussion of such issues so that people with polarising views can discuss such matters respectfully and sensitively. As a whole, society then benefits and matures from such depth and nuance of discourse over time."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00905,2023-11-06-T-011,905,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"I conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, that while this Motion is focused on the Israeli-Hamas conflict with a specific focus to the House on the recent devastation within Gaza, it should be noted that the wider conflict between Israel and Palestine also includes that of the West Bank, an area that spans about 15 times the size Gaza, where it remains the case that death, injury and destruction of property have also increased dramatically since 7 October."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00906,2023-11-06-T-011,906,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not profess to be an expert in the conflict nor do we, as privileged Singaporeans, have moral authority to be able to tell Palestine and Israel how autonomy and statehood should look like for them. However, in this globalised and interconnected world, it is impossible and irresponsible for us to ignore the plight of people suffering all manner of injustice and devastation, illegal settlements where there is little access to food, water and electricity, and uncertainty about their lives tomorrow."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00907,2023-11-06-T-011,907,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"As a Singaporean, I also take heed that what we have here in Singapore; living amongst groups of variable religious persuasions and racial identities, yet still remaining united as one people, is something we should never take for granted. It is something we should guard fiercely and recognise that in another part of the world, this still remains a very distant possibility at best."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00908,2023-11-06-T-011,908,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion and the amendments proposed."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00909,2023-11-06-T-011,909,Deputy Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00910,2023-11-06-T-011,910,Murali Pillai,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00911,2023-11-06-T-011,911,Murali Pillai,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Sir, I support the motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00912,2023-11-06-T-011,912,Murali Pillai,"In my speech, I wish to focus on the response of our Singapore Muslim community, particularly our Malay/Muslim community. I would like to pay tribute to them for taking a courageous and principled stance in relation to the deepening humanitarian crisis arising from Hamas' terrorist attack against Israel on 7 October 2023, and the subsequent Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00913,2023-11-06-T-011,913,Murali Pillai,"Across the world, we have seen, troublingly, a deepening divide across religious lines spilling, on many occasions, into overt hate crimes as a response."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00914,2023-11-06-T-011,914,Murali Pillai,"In the US, a landlord was charged with murder and hate crime for killing a 6-year-old Muslim boy and seriously wounding his mother in Illinois. The landlord allegedly did so because of their religion and the conflict between Hamas and Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00915,2023-11-06-T-011,915,Murali Pillai,There were numerous reports from US-based news agencies pointing to worsening Islamophobia leading to hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents in the country.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00916,2023-11-06-T-011,916,Murali Pillai,"At the same time, antisemitism was also reported to be on the rise across the world. For instance, just on 3 November 2023, the UK Guardian reported that Jewish people in Britain experienced the worst wave of hate incidents in modern times with more than 1,000 recorded to date. In the US, Reuters reported that antisemitic incidents rose by about 400% in two weeks since the Hamas led attack in Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00917,2023-11-06-T-011,917,Murali Pillai,"We have also seen demonstrations in many major cities where anger is being openly stoked with very divisive messages. The narrative is often styled on an ""us versus them"" basis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00918,2023-11-06-T-011,918,Murali Pillai,"A number of organisations have propagated violence at the demonstrations, which will inevitably lead to even more polarization along racial, religious and also nationality lines."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00919,2023-11-06-T-011,919,Murali Pillai,"Singapore is not immune to these developments, but due to the principled stances taken by the leaders in our Muslim community, we have largely avoided polarisation between communities."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00920,2023-11-06-T-011,920,Murali Pillai,"I was deeply struck by what the Mufti of Singapore, Ustaz Nazirudin Mohd Nasir stated in his lefter to the Chief Rabbi of Singapore"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00921,2023-11-06-T-011,921,Murali Pillai,"He said  ""There is no place or justification for any form of violence and brutality on civilians by anyone, including Hamas, or in any retaliatory response. The right of civilians to live peacefully must be protected at all times""."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00922,2023-11-06-T-011,922,Murali Pillai,He further noted that both Islam and Jewish scriptures emphasised the human need for mercy and compassion.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00923,2023-11-06-T-011,923,Murali Pillai,"Finally, he propagated the model of peaceful coexistence amongst communities as a solution to the Middle East crisis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00924,2023-11-06-T-011,924,Murali Pillai,"Unlike so many others outside Singapore, the Mufti separated the violent acts of humans from the religions of Islam and Judaism. Religion is not responsible for this crisis. This is worth emphasising in times like this when lines are drawn precisely along religious lines."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00925,2023-11-06-T-011,925,Murali Pillai,The Mufti deplored the violence and deaths arising from both the terrorists acts of Hamas as well as from Israeli military operations.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00926,2023-11-06-T-011,926,Murali Pillai,"I particularly felt the calling out against terrorist acts of Hamas was important for a diverse, multiracial and religious country like Singapore. As was mentioned numerous times by our Government leaders, Singapore is not immune to a terrorist attack."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00927,2023-11-06-T-011,927,Murali Pillai,"Should a terrorist attack happen here and hostages are taken, we would expect Singapore to retaliate in self defence, in accordance with public international law too."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00928,2023-11-06-T-011,928,Murali Pillai,"On the point of retaliation in self defence, the requirements under international law are clear. Unfortunately, in conflicts, the total avoidance of civilian casualty is impossible."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00929,2023-11-06-T-011,929,Murali Pillai,"However, there are principles such as necessity, not targeting civilians, proportionality and avoiding unnecessary suffering which, when applied, will have the effect of reducing such casualty."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00930,2023-11-06-T-011,930,Murali Pillai,"I also understand from my Muslim friends that Mufti's message was reinforced during Friday sermons and delivered by the imams at our mosques. In these sermons, a call was made to pray for world peace in these troubled times and to advocate ""goodwill and peace""."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00931,2023-11-06-T-011,931,Murali Pillai,"I have spoken to a good number of my Muslim community leaders, friends and residents in Bukit Batok on Mufti's message. Without exception, the Mufti's message resonated strongly with them."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00932,2023-11-06-T-011,932,Murali Pillai,"Each of them told me that, personally, they are deeply affected by the humanitarian crisis. The numerous videos and news articles that they have received from social media platforms conveying the brutal tragedy of the war have affected their conscience."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00933,2023-11-06-T-011,933,Murali Pillai,"At the same time, they accept that these developments should not affect the peace and harmony with fellow Singaporeans."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00934,2023-11-06-T-011,934,Murali Pillai,"They also drew succour from the Singapore Government's position expressed in voting for UNGA resolutions since 1967 which involved, amongst others, advocating for a two-state solution where both the states of Israel and Palestine are recognised; the refusal to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; condemning the illegal construction of settlements by Israel; and calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce to the current crisis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00935,2023-11-06-T-011,935,Murali Pillai,"Their response, collectively, has been in form of prayers for relief from the suffering of affected people; emphasising the Islamic message of peace, compassion, kindness and fairness; and providing assistance through trustworthy and credible channels to help those affected by the tragedy."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00936,2023-11-06-T-011,936,Murali Pillai,"If ever there is a silver lining to this tragedy, they noted the renewed discussion within the international community on the two-state solution which is now increasingly seen as a necessity and bulwark against perpetuation of further violence in future."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00937,2023-11-06-T-011,937,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, sincere thanks are due to our Muslim community for taking this principled approach in dealing with this humanitarian crisis. We should recognise, with the developments across the world, particularly amongst Muslim countries, this is not an easy position for our Muslim Singaporeans to take."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00938,2023-11-06-T-011,938,Murali Pillai,"In 1965, when Singapore was founded, our founding father and 1st Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, exhorted all racial communities, including our Malay community, to build a Singapore for all Singaporeans from all races."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00939,2023-11-06-T-011,939,Murali Pillai,"What may not have been sufficiently highlighted then and now is the fact that when Singapore became independent, our Malay community, which was the majority race before independence, became a minority race thereafter. Yet, our Malay community fully embraced the concept of a Singapore for all races and religions."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00940,2023-11-06-T-011,940,Murali Pillai,"Thankfully, as a result, we secured peace and harmony that contributed to the prosperity and progress of all our people. This spirit is once again exemplified by the responsible approach and stance that has been taken by our Muslim friends, particularly our Malay/Muslim community, in dealing with Gaza crisis. We should never forget this. My sincere thanks to our Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. Thank you."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00941,2023-11-06-T-011,941,Speaker,"Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, you have a clarification to make?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00942,2023-11-06-T-011,942,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. These are the clarifications following on some of the questions which the Leader of the Opposition had asked just now. First, on terrorist activities definition. Let me read a clarification I got from Ministry of Home Affairs. In Singapore, it is an offence for anyone to deal with any individual or organisation regardless of whether it is designated. If the purpose is for terrorist act or otherwise to support terrorism, including the financing of terrorism. It is also an offence to have financial dealings with any individual or organisation that meets the definition of a terrorist or terrorist entity under the Terrorism Suppression of Financing Act 2002, even if it is not specifically designated in the First Schedule. We will not hesitate to take firm action against any individual or entity that poses a security threat, including barring entry into Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00943,2023-11-06-T-011,943,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The definition of terrorist acts is specific. It is quite long. I refer all of you to the Terrorism Suppression of Financing Act of 2002, both section 2 as well as the Second Schedule."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00944,2023-11-06-T-011,944,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, the point is, it depends on the actions. Just to summarise, to give you a flavour of the actions  serious violence against a person; serious damage of property; endangering a person's life; serious risk to the health and safety of the public; use of firearms and explosives; involving the release into the environment any dangerous, hazardous, radioactive or harmful substance, any toxic chemical, any microbiological or toxin; disrupts and seriously interferes with any public computer system or services related to infrastructure, banking, financial services, public utilities; disrupts or interferes with the provision of essential emergency services; involves prejudice to public security and national defence; and where the use or threat of these actions is intended to either influence or compel the Government or any other government or any international organisation to do or refrain from doing any such act or to intimidate the public or section of the public."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00945,2023-11-06-T-011,945,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I think it is very clear what Hamas did would certainly fulfil that definition of a terrorist act and have no doubt it would not be allowed in Singapore, neither to finance or support or to get involved. So, I thought that is an important clarification which I shall leave on the table. I would be happy to send the list to the Leader of the Opposition."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00946,2023-11-06-T-011,946,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The other point was his question about the resolutions which happened in 1967. My staff have done a quick review. I told the House we voted in favour of five resolutions which were passed, primarily to do with humanitarian assistance and the status of Jerusalem."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00947,2023-11-06-T-011,947,Vivian Balakrishnan,"There was one other resolution that we abstained on, but in the end, it was not carried because it did not have a sufficient majority. And this was a resolution that the then-Non-Aligned Movement was trying to pass on 3 July, calling, amongst other things, for the immediate withdrawal of some military forces – but you must understand, in the immediate aftermath of a war, that would have been controversial. Anyway, we abstained but that resolution was not carried, in any case."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00948,2023-11-06-T-011,948,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I hope that illustrates the point that Singapore has taken a consistent position throughout all these years. We still believe in the two-state solution, that the settlements are illegal and the sooner that it is resolved, the better."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00949,2023-11-06-T-011,949,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00950,2023-11-06-T-011,950,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you to the Minister for the two clarifications. On the first clarification, I take the Minister's point. My simple rejoinder earlier was that Hamas was not on that list. I was not questioning whether the Act did not capture them or anything of that sort. If you look at the list, it appears to be a positive list. The Taliban is there. ISIL is there. Daesh is there. I took it from that perspective. I hope that clarifies."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00951,2023-11-06-T-011,951,Pritam Singh,"On the second point, I note the Minister's clarification."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00952,2023-11-06-T-011,952,Speaker,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00953,2023-11-06-T-011,953,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Surely, you are not saying you did not call them out because it was not on the list? But anyway, let us not get bogged down there. The point is, today, in this House, you have agreed, we have all agreed, the acts that were conducted on 7 October were acts of terrorism. I think let us leave it there."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00954,2023-11-06-T-011,954,Speaker,Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00955,2023-11-06-T-011,955,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the amended Motion and I thank Members of Parliament Vikram Nair, Alex Yam and Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for moving this Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00956,2023-11-06-T-011,956,Lawrence Wong,"Sir, we are witnessing the terrible tragedy unfolding in the Middle East. The international community is urgently trying to manage the situation – to expand and sustain the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and to minimise further loss of civilian lives."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00957,2023-11-06-T-011,957,Lawrence Wong,"Singaporeans, too, are following the events closely. We are all horrified by the violence. Our Muslim community in Singapore feel it more strongly because of the empathy and compassion for the Palestinian cause, but no matter our race, our religion or our background, all of us cannot help but grieve that so many lives have been lost and many more remain in danger."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00958,2023-11-06-T-011,958,Lawrence Wong,"As we try to make sense of what is happening, we must recognise that what we are seeing did not erupt overnight. As many have already explained, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a deeply complex one. It is a long-standing feud going back at least decades, if not centuries, involving multiple state and non-state actors. The conflict is not just between Israelis and Palestinians or between people of different faiths, as Minister Vivian had explained just now. It is a political battle for territory, self determination and identity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00959,2023-11-06-T-011,959,Lawrence Wong,"What is at stake, also, is the broader balance of power in the Middle East. Throughout history, this land corridor between the Mediterranean coast and the vast Arabian desert has been the battleground of ancient kingdoms and civilisations. You go back to the Egyptians, Babylonians and Romans to the Ottomans, the British and the French. That battle for regional influence continues today, including between Iran and its Arab neighbours."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00960,2023-11-06-T-011,960,Lawrence Wong,"For years, Iran has been funding, training and arming Hamas as well as other militia in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. It is certainly no coincidence that the brutal attacks by Hamas happened just after Israel normalised relations with the UAE and was in negotiations to do so with Saudi Arabia."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00961,2023-11-06-T-011,961,Lawrence Wong,"Hamas must have anticipated a strong Israeli response when it launched its attacks. In fact, it may well have counted on this so as to rally people in the Middle East to its cause."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00962,2023-11-06-T-011,962,Lawrence Wong,"But any country facing such attacks must respond. Indeed, it is distressing to see the military response by Israel now taking such a terrible toll on civilians in Gaza. The issue threatens to spill over into a much larger regional conflict with major global implications."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00963,2023-11-06-T-011,963,Lawrence Wong,"In the end, after all this, who are the victims? The victims are the Palestinian people themselves, who are being used as pawns and human shields amidst this proxy fight amongst bigger and regional powers."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00964,2023-11-06-T-011,964,Lawrence Wong,"All this is a stark reminder to everyone in Singapore. We live in a dangerous world with complex geopolitics everywhere. We want to be friends with all. We do not import foreign quarrels or politics here. We do not want to choose sides. Instead, we always choose what is in the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00965,2023-11-06-T-011,965,Lawrence Wong,"Both Ministers Vivian and Maliki have both laid out at length Singapore's position on this matter. I will not revisit everything they have said, but let me emphasise two important points that bear repeating."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00966,2023-11-06-T-011,966,Lawrence Wong,"First, what happened on 7 October by Hamas was a planned and coordinated terrorist attack – the brutal massacre of civilians and the taking of civilian hostages. Hamas has said they are ready to repeat these heinous attacks to ""bring about the annihilation of Israel"". That is not just one time. They are prepared to repeat their attacks."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00967,2023-11-06-T-011,967,Lawrence Wong,"The Palestinian people have many historical grievances which we empathise with. These need urgent resolution. But there can be no excuse, no justification whatsoever, for the wanton acts of violence and terrorism by Hamas."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00968,2023-11-06-T-011,968,Lawrence Wong,We must condemn these terrorist acts unequivocally. Let us be clear. It is in our national interest to do so. To compromise on this stand would be to compromise our own security.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00969,2023-11-06-T-011,969,Lawrence Wong,"Second, Israel has a legitimate right to defend itself. This right to defend one's citizens and territory is a fundamental right enshrined in the UN Charter. In this case, it means Israel has the right to take action to prevent Hamas from attacking again."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00970,2023-11-06-T-011,970,Lawrence Wong,"But in exercising this right, Israel must comply fully with the letter and spirit of international humanitarian law and the rules governing the conduct of war. Under the Geneva Conventions, it must respond in a proportionate manner and do its utmost to protect the security and safety of civilians."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00971,2023-11-06-T-011,971,Lawrence Wong,"In other words, no matter how gruesome the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas, they cannot justify a disproportionate response by Israel that imposes collective punishment on the Palestinians in Gaza. If Israel violates international humanitarian law, it risks losing the moral high ground and undermining its own cause both domestically and internationally."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00972,2023-11-06-T-011,972,Lawrence Wong,"The discussions around these international rules can be fraught and subject to differing views and perspectives. But from a humanitarian point of view, the catastrophe now happening in Gaza is horrific and unbearable. Our heart goes out to the Palestinian people."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00973,2023-11-06-T-011,973,Lawrence Wong,"That is why Singapore supported the latest UN resolution calling for a humanitarian truce, leading to a cessation of hostilities. We also urge Israel to facilitate the supply of food, water, medical supplies and fuel in Gaza. And we will do our part to assist in global relief efforts."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00974,2023-11-06-T-011,974,Lawrence Wong,"I am glad that many Singaporeans have responded to the calls for assistance, including by donating generously to the fundraising appeals by the Singapore Red Cross and Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation. These are concrete and practical things we can all do in Singapore in response to this human tragedy."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00975,2023-11-06-T-011,975,Lawrence Wong,"Meanwhile, Singapore's long-standing support for a two-state solution remains unchanged. We believe that the Palestinian people have the right to a homeland and that Israel has the right to live within secure borders. A negotiated two-state solution is the only way for Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security. Realising this may seem difficult, now more than ever, but that should not deter us from continuing to support the international community's efforts in this area."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00976,2023-11-06-T-011,976,Lawrence Wong,Both the Palestinians and Israelis know our position and our principles well. We have good relations with the Palestinians and have committed substantial technical assistance and support to the Palestinian Authority over the years and we will continue to do so.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00977,2023-11-06-T-011,977,Lawrence Wong,"We also have a strong, long-standing relationship with Israel. Israel helped build up the SAF during our early years and we continue to cooperate closely with them across many areas, including in science and technology."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00978,2023-11-06-T-011,978,Lawrence Wong,"So, we are friends with both Israel and the Palestinians. But it does not mean we support everything each side does. Instead, we consistently take a principled position, in line with international law and in support of global peace and security. On that basis, we have voted in favour of many Palestinian-related resolutions at the UN over the years. For example, we have criticised Israel's settlement activities in the West Bank as violations of international law. We have also voted against Jerusalem being recognised as the capital of Israel."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00979,2023-11-06-T-011,979,Lawrence Wong,"Indeed, such unilateral moves by Israel detract from the two-state solution. That is partly the reason why more and more Palestinians feel that violence is the only way to achieve their goals."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00980,2023-11-06-T-011,980,Lawrence Wong,The international community must therefore give Palestinians reasons to think otherwise. A non-violent path to an independent Palestinian state must be made unmistakably clear. Then the ideas of organisations like Hamas and its belief in the use of violence and terrorism can truly be defeated.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00981,2023-11-06-T-011,981,Lawrence Wong,"In all that we do, Sir, Singapore will act in accordance with our national interest and we will consistently choose principles and international law. That is what makes a small nation like us a credible, reliable and trusted partner on the international stage."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00982,2023-11-06-T-011,982,Lawrence Wong,"Beyond upholding our national interests, we must not allow external events like these to divide us. Because in such conflicts, individual passions are bound to be aroused. In this age of social media, images, videos and stories will be frequently propagated online specifically to rile up emotions and sow distrust. This can turn a faraway conflict into an emotionally charged issue that can easily spiral out of control, even here in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00983,2023-11-06-T-011,983,Lawrence Wong,"We have already seen instances of hate speech and religiously motivated attacks elsewhere in recent days. In France, a teacher was fatally stabbed by a Russian-Muslim attacker amid rising tensions between the Jewish and Muslim communities there. In the US, a six-year-old Palestinian-American was fatally stabbed and his mother wounded by an American in a religiously motivated hate crime."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00984,2023-11-06-T-011,984,Lawrence Wong,"Singapore is not immune to such divisive forces. In the month of October alone, the Police received eight reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at members of the Jewish or Muslim communities in Singapore. Eight may not seem like a large number to you, but in just this one month of October, we have received almost the same number of related reports as we did in the preceding nine months of the year combined. So, it is a very sharp spike."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00985,2023-11-06-T-011,985,Lawrence Wong,That is why we cannot afford to be complacent. We know from our own painful history how disastrous ethnic and religious strife can be.  That is why we have worked so hard over the years to foster social harmony across our different communities.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00986,2023-11-06-T-011,986,Lawrence Wong,We have built up networks of friendship and trust across different community and religious leaders through platforms like the Racial and Religious Harmony Circles. We regularly promote inter-faith and inter-ethnic dialogue to bring together different communities and to respectfully discuss sensitive issues of race and religion.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00987,2023-11-06-T-011,987,Lawrence Wong,"Our schools and IHLs are also involved to teach our young to interact with one another in a safe and respectful way, and to help them to understand global issues in the context of Singapore's unique multicultural milieu."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00988,2023-11-06-T-011,988,Lawrence Wong,"So, I am very glad that our community and religious leaders understand what is at stake. Our religious leaders, in particular, are expressing their views in a way that shows sensitivity, compassion and kindness; so as not to destabilise peace and harmony in our society. They have led many positive efforts to emphasise unity, not division."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00989,2023-11-06-T-011,989,Lawrence Wong,"When the conflict first erupted, as all of you know, Mufti Ustaz Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir wrote to the Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel in Singapore, who later replied to him, and both expressed empathy and solidarity with one another."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00990,2023-11-06-T-011,990,Lawrence Wong,The Inter-Religious Organisation brought together various faith leaders to pray for peace and the safety of civilians in both Israel and Gaza.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00991,2023-11-06-T-011,991,Lawrence Wong,"On such emotive issues, it makes all the difference to have religious leaders who understand what is happening and what is at stake for Singapore. They are able to guide their flock and help to hold the social cohesion and trust between our different religious groups. Some may think that this guidance is not necessary. But they are mistaken."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00992,2023-11-06-T-011,992,Lawrence Wong,"Just look at what is happening elsewhere. The more extreme religious leaders on all sides also tend to be the ones who are more emotional, more vocal in pressing their case, in advocating their own narratives. Those calling for peace, dialogue and engagement tend to be the ones who are drowned out or silenced."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00993,2023-11-06-T-011,993,Lawrence Wong,"What is the end result? The end result is not more light but more darkness, not more peace and harmony but more division and hatred in society and we certainly do not want that to happen in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00994,2023-11-06-T-011,994,Lawrence Wong,"So, we should be very, very grateful for the leadership shown by our religious leaders like Mufti and Chief Rabbi. I thank them for their leadership, and I call on all Singaporeans to emulate their examples, and ensure we never let anything divide us or drive a wedge in our society."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00995,2023-11-06-T-011,995,Lawrence Wong,"All of us, as individuals, can all do our part too. The Government will continue to provide safe spaces for such sensitive conversations to take place, but we should do our part to be respectful and constructive in our dialogue and discourse, both online and offline. We should strive to listen to and empathise with one another, especially when we disagree and have different views and we should not hesitate to call loud inflammatory language which seek to turn communities against each other."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00996,2023-11-06-T-011,996,Lawrence Wong,"In this way, we can collectively strengthen the peace and social cohesion that is essential to the Singaporean way of life."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00997,2023-11-06-T-011,997,Lawrence Wong,"I am glad that all Members of the House are with the Government on this, as we have heard in all the speeches so far. The WP and the PSP have put out their Parties' position on this matter and, indeed, their positions are consistent with the Government's position, indeed, the national position."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00998,2023-11-06-T-011,998,Lawrence Wong,"We were a little concerned at first with the WP's statement for the reasons highlighted – because it stopped short of condemning Hamas; it referred to it as a ""military operation"" rather than a terrorist act."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-00999,2023-11-06-T-011,999,Lawrence Wong,"The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Singh, has explained the context and the circumstances behind the WP's statement, so we understand, but I am sure Mr Singh would also appreciate, without the benefit of his explanation earlier, there was ambiguity about that statement. There were questions raised about the WP's stance on the actions of Hamas and some might even ask whether the WP had deliberately overlooked this just to appear more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01000,2023-11-06-T-011,1000,Lawrence Wong,"So, I am very glad that Mr Singh has stood up and explained the WP's position clearly and has condemned Hamas' acts as acts of terrorism. And, perhaps, if he is so minded, Mr Singh might update the WP's social media platform to reflect this position so that there is no ambiguity about the matter whatsoever."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01001,2023-11-06-T-011,1001,Lawrence Wong,This is not a trivial matter. This is not just nitpicking at words. It is a key point of principle because national security is at stake.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01002,2023-11-06-T-011,1002,Lawrence Wong,"And, Sir, indeed, in situations like this, we must stand united. Politics must stop at the water's edge and that means on external matters where national security is at stake, political parties should not try to outflank the Government just to score political points."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01003,2023-11-06-T-011,1003,Lawrence Wong,Let us not risk our precious unity for short-term political gain. Not when our collective security and fundamental interests are at stake. All of us owe this basic duty to Singaporeans.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01004,2023-11-06-T-011,1004,Lawrence Wong,"At the end of this debate, I hope all of us, everyone in this House – PAP, WP, PSP as well as all Nominated Members – wilI support the Motion and we can have a common pro-Singapore's stand on the matter. This is not politics. This is our national security."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01005,2023-11-06-T-011,1005,Lawrence Wong,"Several Members also asked about the economic and security implications of the conflict on Singapore. Sir, we are monitoring the economic situation closely. For now, the direct economic impact is small, because of our limited trade and investment linkages with Israel and Palestine. But should the conflict between Israel and Hamas broaden into a regional conflict in the Middle East, there will certainly be wider implications, especially on oil and food prices."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01006,2023-11-06-T-011,1006,Lawrence Wong,"So, we must be prepared for more uncertainties ahead and we are updating our drawer plans should the situation take a turn for the worse and we are impacted."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01007,2023-11-06-T-011,1007,Lawrence Wong,"On the security front, Singapore can draw lessons from what has happened. The surprise attack by Hamas caught Israel off guard. It is a potent reminder that we must always be vigilant. And that is why, since 9/11, we have raised our defence capabilities to respond to terror attacks. For example, through the Counter-Terrorism Information Facility, we work closely with other countries to share intelligence and to provide early warning against terrorism in the region."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01008,2023-11-06-T-011,1008,Lawrence Wong,"The SAF and the Home Team conduct regular exercises, and these have also helped to raise a high level of readiness in our society against terror attacks, be it from air, land or sea."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01009,2023-11-06-T-011,1009,Lawrence Wong,"With the ongoing conflict, these efforts have certainly gained greater salience because we know that Singapore is an attractive target for foreign terrorist groups as well as self-radicalised individuals."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01010,2023-11-06-T-011,1010,Lawrence Wong,"And while Israel and Gaza may be far away, what happens in the Middle East can affect us here in Southeast Asia and Singapore. We fully expect extremist and terrorist groups in the region to use this conflict to rile up sentiments and radicalise more individuals."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01011,2023-11-06-T-011,1011,Lawrence Wong,"Members all know that in recent years, we have detained Singaporeans who fell for pro-Hamas narratives and wanted to take up arms overseas. We have had radicalised individuals who have also planned attacks on Singaporean targets and since the conflict started, regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has already gone up three-fold – because we track these sites, we know the traffic has increased and we have also observed an uptick in anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01012,2023-11-06-T-011,1012,Lawrence Wong,"So, amidst this conflict, it is more urgent than ever that we prepare for all contingencies. That is why our security agencies are on heightened alert, and we have put in place additional security measures as a precaution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01013,2023-11-06-T-011,1013,Lawrence Wong,"All of us, Singaporeans, must stay vigilant too, by reporting any suspicious behaviour or activity to the authorities because in the end, our ability to respond to any terrorist incident depends on all of us as Singaporeans working together. We must remain cohesive and united as a society, so that we can keep Singapore safe and secure."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01014,2023-11-06-T-011,1014,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, the tragedies of terror, conflict, and war are sober reminders to us all. That, above all else, we are more similar than we are different. That we can rise above what divides us, and embrace our shared humanity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01015,2023-11-06-T-011,1015,Lawrence Wong,"I spoke earlier about the exchange of letters between Mufti and the Chief Rabbi of Singapore. Mufti said and I quote  ""Our work to put forth a different model of peaceful co-existence, where every community in Singapore can live peacefully alongside other faiths and celebrate diversity, has now become even more critical… Despite the overwhelming challenges, achieving peaceful relations is not impossible and is now the greatest urgency."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01016,2023-11-06-T-011,1016,Lawrence Wong,And I cannot agree more with him. Achieving peaceful relations is not impossible. It is now of the greatest urgency.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01017,2023-11-06-T-011,1017,Lawrence Wong,"Singapore has gone through much to get to where we are today. Singaporeans of all races and religions can live side by side. We understand and share in one another's festive celebrations, all of us proud of our multiracial, multi-religious Singaporean identity."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01018,2023-11-06-T-011,1018,Lawrence Wong,"So, to every Singaporean, to every Member of this House, I say let us be good stewards, good stewards of our peace and harmony. Let us never take it for granted. Let us work at it consistently, assiduously, daily and let us stand together, now more than ever, as one united people. Sir, I support the Motion. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01019,2023-11-06-T-011,1019,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01020,2023-11-06-T-011,1020,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just two points for the Deputy Prime Minister. Number one, he spoke of a request for us to update the WP's statement of the 18 October. I am happy to note that he is clear that the positions taken by Mr Giam and myself have clarified the matter. So, we will append our speeches to that statement and it should make our position quite clear."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01021,2023-11-06-T-011,1021,Pritam Singh,"My second point really is about something a bit more fundamental – which Deputy Prime Minister spoke about. He talked about it being a national security matter, that there was an impression that the Government had – that there were some omissions which were quite critical."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01022,2023-11-06-T-011,1022,Pritam Singh,"The Government did not take us into confidence on its position on the Israel-Hamas issue. On 18 of October, I did not get any message from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or anyone, suggesting to me that our statement was problematic from a national security angle."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01023,2023-11-06-T-011,1023,Pritam Singh,"But I would like to assure the Foreign Minister and, of course, the Government as well and the Deputy Prime Minister, that in future, if the Government has an inkling of such a concern, that there are national security matters or issues which the opposition may not be apprised of or we may have completely ignored, let us know. My assurance to the Deputy Prime Minister is that we will certainly take those views on board very carefully – because as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, at the end of the day, we want a Singapore where we have a united population even though we know that the issue tugs at the heart strings of people on both sides."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01024,2023-11-06-T-011,1024,Pritam Singh,"So, that is my assurance to the Deputy Prime Minister."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01025,2023-11-06-T-011,1025,Speaker,Deputy Prime Minister.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01026,2023-11-06-T-011,1026,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that assurance. I am glad that he will be posting his speech and Mr Giam's speech on the website. I think what is more important is not just the speech themselves but a clear position from the WP that it condemns unequivocable the acts of terrorism by Hamas. And then we are all in a common position on that."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01027,2023-11-06-T-011,1027,Lawrence Wong,"And on national security, I fully take on board the points that he has raised. We will and we have been, and we will continue to do this from time to time when indeed there are national security concerns, we take the WP into confidence, we share what they and we would appreciate very much across all political parties, whatever our backgrounds, we stand united as Singaporeans because on such matters, there can be nothing that divides us. But united as Singaporeans, we can overcome all challenges together."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01028,2023-11-06-T-011,1028,Speaker,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01029,2023-11-06-T-011,1029,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, I thank the hon Members Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for raising this Motion. This Motion is important for three reasons."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01030,2023-11-06-T-011,1030,Raj Joshua Thomas,"First, it reiterates Singapore's principled approach to such conflicts and our commitment to UN's processes and rule of international law as underlying basis for international relations. This has been our consistent approach and it is an important foreign policy cornerstone for us as a small state."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01031,2023-11-06-T-011,1031,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Second, it acknowledges that there are victims on both sides of the conflict and that both sides should ensure the protection of civilians and the delivery of humanitarian aid."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01032,2023-11-06-T-011,1032,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Third, the Motion calls on us in Singapore to uphold and protect our multiracial and multi-religious way of life. We have seen how this conflict has precipitated racial attacks in several countries. The Guardian reported yesterday that Britain is facing the worst wave of hate incidents in modern times, with 1,000 recorded after the Hamas attack, which included assaults targeting children and schools. Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations reported a rise in Islamophobia with incidents and requests for help spiking by 182% since the Hamas attacks."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01033,2023-11-06-T-011,1033,Raj Joshua Thomas,"In Singapore, our strong multi-religious and multiracial relations act as a bulwark against such reactions, aside, of course, from such acts being illegal and liable to strict prosecution by the authorities. While inter-community trust in Singapore is high, dialogue among the Government, religious leaders and Singaporeans of all communities is critical to keep our peace and I understand that significant efforts have been made in this regard. It is important for us to continue to do so, and everyone has a part to play, as mentioned by other speakers."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01034,2023-11-06-T-011,1034,Raj Joshua Thomas,"The current conflict is not a new conflict. It is an escalation of sustained attacks by Hamas on Israel over more than two decades and responses by Israel. Since 2001, Palestinian militants have launched tens of thousands of rocket and motor attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. These attacks have been described and condemned as terrorist attacks by the United Nations. These attacks have also been condemned by the Palestinian Authority that governs the West Bank, as it says that rocket attacks undermine peace."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01035,2023-11-06-T-011,1035,Raj Joshua Thomas,"In 2023, before October, there were over 1,500 sporadic rocket attacks into Israel, with the largest attack in May 2013. Hamas' 2017 Charter declares the state of Israel as illegal and illegitimate and states that its aim is the elimination of Israel. Israel's Foreign Minister told the United Nations, following the October attack, that Israel had vowed to destroy Hamas. He said and I quote, ""How can you agree to a ceasefire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?"""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01036,2023-11-06-T-011,1036,Raj Joshua Thomas,"But, Sir, the situation is complex. Both Jews and Arabs claim a historical right to territories in and surrounding Israel. Layered on this are overlapping religious claims and sensitivities. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, which sits atop the Temple Mount and Wailing Wall, for example, continues to be a recurring flashpoint."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01037,2023-11-06-T-011,1037,Raj Joshua Thomas,"I led a trade delegation to Israel in May this year. We arrived the week after a barrage of rocket launches into Israel. The Israelis have built for themselves a modern cosmopolitan country in which they enjoy a First-World lifestyle despite the constant threat of attacks. I extended my stay after the trade trip and made my way into Bethlehem and Hebron in the West Bank. The West Bank is markedly different from neighbouring Israel, with a significantly lower quality of life."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01038,2023-11-06-T-011,1038,Raj Joshua Thomas,"I went past checkpoints and saw from afar the Jewish settlements and security surrounding it. On the one hand, I understood the Israeli security measures. On the other, I understood the Palestinians' desire for freedom of movement in their own land. I could also see that there was no easy solution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01039,2023-11-06-T-011,1039,Raj Joshua Thomas,"One thing that is clear, however, is that both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples' overriding desire is self-determination. The right to decide their own destiny and the right to live in their country with security and freedom of movement with access to economic amenities and jobs and opportunities for advancement."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01040,2023-11-06-T-011,1040,Raj Joshua Thomas,"To have the freedom to practise their own religion, to build homes and families and to grow their economy, society and culture and to stand proudly amongst the people of the world. This can only be achieved through a two-state solution that this Motion reiterates Singapore's support for."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01041,2023-11-06-T-011,1041,Raj Joshua Thomas,"I hope that Singaporeans will see the complexity of the situation in the Middle East. It is not so easy to unequivocally say ""I support Israel"" or ""I support the Palestinians"", because there are legitimate justifications, arguments and concerns on both sides. In this regard, Ambassador Burhan Gafoor's qualifications in his explanation on our vote in the United Nations on the protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations is as important as Singapore's vote in favour of the resolution. Ambassador Gafoor deeply regretted, first, that the resolution omitted to mention Hamas' abhorrent attack on Israel and the abduction of innocent hostages; and, second, that it also omitted to acknowledge Israel's legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01042,2023-11-06-T-011,1042,Raj Joshua Thomas,"But armed conflicts invariably lead to tragedy, as people lose their lives, their loved ones and their homes. What we can see definitively is that we support humanity and the alleviation of the suffering of people who are caught in conflicts, in particular, civilians, children and hostages. This includes more than 1.4 million Palestinian refugees who have been displaced from their homes, and this Motion also makes this call."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01043,2023-11-06-T-011,1043,Raj Joshua Thomas,"I am happy to read of the various ground-up measures to raise funds and provide aid for communities in Gaza. For example, the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation has raised over $4.5 million in less than two weeks. These funds will be used to provide healthcare supplies and shelter for those affected in this conflict."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01044,2023-11-06-T-011,1044,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Finally, I support the Motion's call for Singaporeans to safeguard and uphold our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony. It is understandable that such conflicts can invoke strong feelings in our communities. We must take care that such overseas situations do not affect our societal harmony. In this regard, I was heartened to read that the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) is developing a religious advisory to guide Muslims here on the response to overseas conflicts, such as the current conflict, and has been actively engaging the Muslim community to provide an understanding of the conflict from the local religious perspective."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01045,2023-11-06-T-011,1045,Raj Joshua Thomas,"This is particularly important in light of the increasing prevalence of people turning to social media, like TikTok, as a source of news which may contain misinformation and incendiary posts. Other religious communities have also been involved in their own way. His Holiness Pope Francis called for a day of fasting and prayer on 27 October 2023 to intercede for an end to the Israel-Hamas war. This was observed at our local Singapore churches."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01046,2023-11-06-T-011,1046,Raj Joshua Thomas,"We must all make continuous efforts to protect and bolster our multiracial and multi-religious society, where the necessary measures are taken by the relevant parties. I trust in Singapore's level headedness and generosity and that our reaction will be to come together to collectively provide humanitarian support and prayer for the victims of war. Sir, I support the Motion as amended."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01047,2023-11-06-T-011,1047,Speaker,Mr Sharael Taha.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01048,2023-11-06-T-011,1048,Sharael Taha,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I will begin with expressing our condolences to all the innocent victims and civilian casualties in this conflict. My speech will touch on four key points."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01049,2023-11-06-T-011,1049,Sharael Taha,"Firstly, to voice the feelings of the community as we are presented with scenes of the conflict. Secondly, advocating for immediate humanitarian truce and the urgent and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Thirdly, how do we make sense of this conflict? And lastly, what can we do in our own Singaporean way to contribute towards a resolution?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01050,2023-11-06-T-011,1050,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, Sir, what we are seeing in Gaza is difficult to see and we cannot turn a blind eye on. Mass and social media are abuzz daily with scenes of destruction, deaths, despair and hopelessness in Gaza, as the crisis escalates and spirals out of control. I would like to thank many Pasir Ris-Punggol residents for reaching out to share their concerns on this crisis. Many shared that they are grappling with a range of emotions, such as anger, hurt, helplessness, and they shared their struggle to make sense of what is happening."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01051,2023-11-06-T-011,1051,Sharael Taha,"One Pasir Ris resident, Mr Ramos Chua, shared that it was sad and heart-wrenching to see the deaths and destruction in Gaza. Another Pasir Ris resident, Ms Shazwani Ahmad, shared that the content on social media is devastating and it makes social media feel like a dark, black hole we cannot get out of. Many questioned the disproportionate use of force that has led us to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the size and scale of which have left us wondering how could this be happening in this day and age?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01052,2023-11-06-T-011,1052,Sharael Taha,"How can we watch the death and destruction, tolerate watching women, children and elderly fleeing for their lives, people searching frantically for their families under the rubble and see fellow humans deprive of food, water and medical supplies?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01053,2023-11-06-T-011,1053,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we empathise with the plight of innocent victims and civilian casualties as they become collateral damage to the military operations in Gaza. We feel utterly helpless in the face of these atrocities happening daily, as innocent lives bear the burden of collective responsibility for the attacks on 7 October."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01054,2023-11-06-T-011,1054,Sharael Taha,"Let us be clear. Fellow Parliamentarians here have already shared how the attack on 7 October, which killed 1,400 soldiers and many civilians, has been rightfully condemned globally. However, Israel's military response has killed more than 9,000 Palestinians, including children. Humanity group, Save the Children, described the living conditions in Gaza as pure horror."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01055,2023-11-06-T-011,1055,Sharael Taha,"Many have voiced their feelings of helplessness and shared that Israel's response is disproportionate, but let the due process in international law address that, as some of our fellow Parliamentarians have mentioned earlier. What is clear is that many are grappling with the emotions as they feel the injustice and moral indignation, as we witness the asymmetry in military and the widespread suffering in Gaza, which sadly point towards even more deaths for civilians caught in the crossfire."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01056,2023-11-06-T-011,1056,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the situation in the conflict has escalated very quickly to the humanitarian crisis that we see today. For decades, the Palestinian people have lived under difficult conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories where their basic rights have been curtailed."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01057,2023-11-06-T-011,1057,Sharael Taha,"The conflict had begun even before 7 October, where, for decades, the Palestinians have been subjected to systemic discrimination, abuse, restricted movements and they have endured eviction from their generational homes and witnessed expansion of illegal settlements. The recent escalation of the conflict has no doubt made it even more inhumane for the civilians. With no end in sight, it does not seem far-fetched to fear the worst. As such, Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01058,2023-11-06-T-011,1058,Sharael Taha,"We must advocate a humanitarian truce and ensure the immediate delivery of aid to the civilian population in Gaza. It was, indeed, imperative that on 27 October, Singapore took an unequivocal stand and expressed its concerns over the situation in Gaza by supporting the UN resolution calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce, emphasising that civilians must be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law and the immediate and unhindered provision of essential supplies to civilians in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01059,2023-11-06-T-011,1059,Sharael Taha,"Singapore stood firm with many from the rest of the world in favour of a non-binding resolution drafted by the Arab states, even when 44 other countries abstained from voting and 14 voted against it."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01060,2023-11-06-T-011,1060,Sharael Taha,Singapore has remained consistent throughout the past 50 years on our position in the Middle East with regard to safeguarding humanitarian interests and upholding international law.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01061,2023-11-06-T-011,1061,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, this conflict in the Middle East has long existed and remained unresolved. The conflict draws much regional and international attention, as competing stakeholders safeguard their own interests. It would be naive of anyone to assume that a solution is easy and Singapore has always supported a two-state solution and our vote on 27 October in the UN resolution reaffirms that stand."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01062,2023-11-06-T-011,1062,Sharael Taha,"While we continue to hope for cessation of hostilities, how do we then provide support towards a two-state solution? What can we do, given our size and geostrategic interests? How can we respond to this in a constructive way consistent with our values?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01063,2023-11-06-T-011,1063,Sharael Taha,"One of our volunteers in Pasir Ris, Mr Martin Modarei asked if countries like us can play a role to help the legitimate Palestinian leaders with capacity-building when the conflict winds down."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01064,2023-11-06-T-011,1064,Sharael Taha,"Firstly, a long-term solution can only be via a diplomatic solution. Hence, at the international level, we need to continue to support the UN in upholding international law, just like what we did on 27 October. Prior to this, we also voted against the illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory as they contravene international law, too."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01065,2023-11-06-T-011,1065,Sharael Taha,"Additionally, we must keep in mind our unique position. To quote Prime Minister Lee in his speech at the joint press conference for the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat at the Istana last Monday, ""We have diplomatic relations with Israel but, at the same time, we have friendly relations with the Palestinian Authority. It is in our best interest that a long-term two-state solution be diplomatically negotiated and be upheld by international law."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01066,2023-11-06-T-011,1066,Sharael Taha,"Secondly, while we work towards an immediate humanitarian truce, we must continue to support capability-building for the Palestinian Authority. Singapore has friendly relations with the Palestinian Authority, as evident in Minister Maliki and Minister Vivian's visit to Ramallah in 2022. More recently, on 10 July, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean called on the Palestinian Authority's Prime Minister during his visit to Ramallah, reaffirming the warm ties between Singapore and the Palestinian Authority."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01067,2023-11-06-T-011,1067,Sharael Taha,"We must continue to support capability building for the Palestinians, such as through the $10-million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP), which has benefited more than 600 Palestinian officials in courses on public administration, technical and vocational education, and training and economic development. This is in addition to the healthcare packages during COVID-19 and customised healthcare courses and postgraduate scholarships aimed at training Palestinian policymakers. We must be ready to provide additional help to assist the Palestinians to support capability building."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01068,2023-11-06-T-011,1068,Sharael Taha,"I met some of the Palestinian officials on ETAP training, together with Habib Hassan, last year. They expressed hope. They are positive about the future and expressed appreciation at the support Singapore provides."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01069,2023-11-06-T-011,1069,Sharael Taha,"Thirdly, while the Israel-Hamas conflict provokes divisive views, in Singapore, as individuals, we must continue to safeguard and uphold our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01070,2023-11-06-T-011,1070,Sharael Taha,"The conflict can easily be misconstrued as a religious conflict, which can quickly fan the flames of religious fervour. I would like to urge my fellow Singaporeans to exercise caution. The fact is, as mentioned by many Parliamentarians already, this is a complicated conflict that has been marred by history, politics, infighting, past decisions, political alliances, with many different and divisive perspectives, with different stakeholders safeguarding their own interests."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01071,2023-11-06-T-011,1071,Sharael Taha,"For our own peace and security, we must avoid a polarisation of views on this crisis, especially since we know it has the potential to amplify divisive lines within our society. While many societies in the world are wedged by their differences, we must stay united as a society and recognise that this is first and foremost a humanitarian crisis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01072,2023-11-06-T-011,1072,Sharael Taha,"Lastly, united and together, we can mobilise our community to have a greater impact on this humanitarian crisis. Hence, efforts where our community comes together, regardless of race or religion, like the RLAF donation collection, Red Cross Foundation and efforts by Humanity Matters, where volunteers from different faiths come together to pack medical and relief supplies to be sent to Gaza, represent our united commitment to alleviate the humanitarian crisis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01073,2023-11-06-T-011,1073,Sharael Taha,"Two weeks ago, in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, we organised our seventh inter-faith charity drive, aptly named, Blessings in Harmony. It brought together the different religious organisations in Punggol such as Al-Islah Mosque, Fo Guang Shan temple, Church of the Transfiguration, amongst many others, and other volunteer organisations to work together for their beneficiaries, regardless of race, language or religion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01074,2023-11-06-T-011,1074,Sharael Taha,"These are our blessings in harmony. In Singapore, we are indeed blessed with this harmony and we are blessed to live in harmony. It is something that we cannot take for granted. We cannot let external factors divide us. We are unique in this sense. This is how we come together and respond as a united people in any time of need, including when helping others. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01075,2023-11-06-T-011,1075,Sharael Taha,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, my speech will touch on four points. First, to voice out the community's feelings on the Middle East issue. Second, to advocate for a ""humanitarian truce"", and sending humanitarian aid immediately and without any obstacles to Gaza. Third, how can we understand this conflict. Lastly, what we can do, in our own way to contribute towards a lasting solution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01076,2023-11-06-T-011,1076,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, many of us are dealing with various emotions, such as anger, sadness, confusion and injustice when we see reports and social media broadcasts about Gaza. What more when videos on social media show that many children and families are killed in this humanitarian crisis"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01077,2023-11-06-T-011,1077,Sharael Taha,"Over decades, the Palestinians have been living in hardship in the of ""occupied Palestinian territory"" where their basic rights have been curtailed or neglected. The escalation of conflict since 7 October has worsened the humanitarian crisis."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01078,2023-11-06-T-011,1078,Sharael Taha,"Ever since the terrorist attack, which was condemned globally, killed 1,400 military personnel and civilians, Israel's military response has killed more than 9,000 Palestinians including more than 3,000 children. Many felt that the military response caused excessive collateral damage and was an imbalanced response. This conflict continues to injure and kill civilians regardless of age, race and religion. Therefore, many of our people want the hostilities to stop, so that humanitarian aid can be rendered in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01079,2023-11-06-T-011,1079,Sharael Taha,"Therefore, it is important that on 27 October, Singapore took a firm stand and expressed our concern over the situation in Gaza by supporting the UN resolution to condemn all acts of violence to civilians regardless of race, call for an immediate humanitarian truce and cessation of hostilities, ensure the protection of civilians and delivery of humanitarian aid immediately without any hindrance."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01080,2023-11-06-T-011,1080,Sharael Taha,"We hope the UN resolution will be effective in the cessation of hostilities and providing humanitarian assistance. This is only a temporary measure, while a long-term solution is being worked out."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01081,2023-11-06-T-011,1081,Sharael Taha,"Mr Speaker, the conflict in the Middle East has existed for a long time. The fact is that these conflicts have been marred by politics, internal quarrels, past decisions, history, and different and conflicting perspectives."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01082,2023-11-06-T-011,1082,Sharael Taha,"This conflict is very complicated and cannot be simplified as simply differences over religion. Those who died are regardless of age, race or religion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01083,2023-11-06-T-011,1083,Sharael Taha,"A resident of Pasir Ris, Madam Syaazwani Ahmad, said, ""It is clear now that this is an issue of political conflict that have resulted in humanitarian issues."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01084,2023-11-06-T-011,1084,Sharael Taha,The conflict can only be resolved through a two-state solution. This is the stance that Singapore has always supported and our support for the UN resolution on 27 October reaffirms that stance.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01085,2023-11-06-T-011,1085,Sharael Taha,"While we look forward to the cessation of hostilities, how can we provide support towards a peaceful two-state solution? How can we act on this in a constructive way, in line with our values?"
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01086,2023-11-06-T-011,1086,Sharael Taha,"First, a resolution can only be reached through a diplomatic solution."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01087,2023-11-06-T-011,1087,Sharael Taha,"Therefore, we must unite the voices to support the resolution at the UN which upholds international law. Just like what we did at the UN resolution on 27 Oct, we had also previously supported the vote against illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories as it also violates international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01088,2023-11-06-T-011,1088,Sharael Taha,"Second, while we strive for the cessation of hostilities, we must continue to support the capability building efforts of the Palestinian Authority (PA)."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01089,2023-11-06-T-011,1089,Sharael Taha,Singapore has a unique relationship because we have diplomatic relations with Israel and good relations with the PA.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01090,2023-11-06-T-011,1090,Sharael Taha,"With that, I am heartened to hear Minister Maliki answering my Parliamentary Question and reaffirming his continued support for the ETAP Programme to further support the building of the PA capability in which Singapore has allocated S$10 million and has trained more than 600 Palestinian officials."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01091,2023-11-06-T-011,1091,Sharael Taha,"During my meeting with Palestinian officials who went through ETAP training in Singapore before the crisis, they shared that they had positive expectations and expressed appreciation for the support given by Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01092,2023-11-06-T-011,1092,Sharael Taha,"Third, while the Israel-Hamas conflict creates disunity, in Singapore, we must continue to maintain and uphold our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01093,2023-11-06-T-011,1093,Sharael Taha,"We must avoid polarising views on this crisis, especially because we know it has the potential to widen the dividing cracks within our society."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01094,2023-11-06-T-011,1094,Sharael Taha,Efforts such as fund raising efforts by RLAF and Humanity Matters in which we work together to unite our people will enable us to make a more effective impact in rendering assistance to this humanitarian crisis.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01095,2023-11-06-T-011,1095,Sharael Taha,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, Sir, when we look at the chaos around us, it is easy to be engulfed by the emotions around it. The situation in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis, first and foremost. The complexity in the situation makes this conflict difficult to resolve."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01096,2023-11-06-T-011,1096,Sharael Taha,"There are ways in which Singapore can assist to alleviate the crisis. We can only do so if we remain united together. Staying together is how we can best assist the situation in Gaza as the world continues to work towards a long-lasting two-state solution. As such, I am in support of the Motion."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01097,2023-11-06-T-011,1097,Speaker,Mr Keith Chua.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01098,2023-11-06-T-011,1098,Keith Chua,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the loss of any innocent life is tragic. The taking of innocent lives of civilians is a crime, as is the taking of innocent civilians as hostages. All wars are tragic and inevitably have tragic consequences on innocent lives."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01099,2023-11-06-T-011,1099,Keith Chua,"Singapore supported the recent UN resolution on 26 October 2023, entitled ""Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations"", along with 119 member nations. This resolution calls for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities as well as for all parties to respect international law."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01100,2023-11-06-T-011,1100,Keith Chua,"Our Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Burhan Gafoor said this, following the passing of the UN resolution, ""We deeply regret that this resolution has two glaring and significant omissions."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01101,2023-11-06-T-011,1101,Keith Chua,"""First, it makes no mention of Hamas' role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages. These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever. We reiterate our call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01102,2023-11-06-T-011,1102,Keith Chua,"""Second, this resolution does not acknowledge Israel's legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01103,2023-11-06-T-011,1103,Keith Chua,"With all the discussion from fellow Members so far, I believe this House is in agreement with our Ambassador, especially as we have heard from our various Ministers as well."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01104,2023-11-06-T-011,1104,Keith Chua,"Our Prime Minister said this in response to media questions on the issue, ""When innocent civilians suffer, infants, kids or grandparents, sometimes by side effect of military conflict, sometimes directly targeted, and in this case, what happened on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel and launched vicious, horrible attacks against large numbers of civilians and killed 1,300 people, maybe more, mostly innocent civilians – it's horrendous. It isn't something which could be justified by any rationale whatsoever."" I agree with the Prime Minister."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01105,2023-11-06-T-011,1105,Keith Chua,"Our Minister for Law and Home Affairs had this to say on the ongoing conflict, ""We need to be clear about our stance – we condemn all acts of terrorism and wanton violence. But we must not let these events happening externally affect the internal situation within Singapore. We must, in Singapore, maintain our racial and religious peace."" The Minister is correct and, in a subsequent interview to the media, stressed that humanitarian aid has been given by the people of Singapore across all faiths and sectors."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01106,2023-11-06-T-011,1106,Keith Chua,"I quote the Minister in responding to the Humanity Matters relief effort, ""Today, Humanity Matters, you look at who is contributing  Taoists, Missions, Buddhist Temples, Hindu volunteers, Muslim organisations, corporations, and of course majority of those involved are Chinese. This is Singapore, this is unique about Singapore – everyone comes together to help, even though they know most of the help goes towards Muslims in Gaza. They are human beings. They need help. We do what we can. That is what Humanity Matters' action today shows. Likewise,"" the Minister was referring to the previous day, ""yesterday, Sikh temples, Hindu temples, Christian organisations, pastors, Buddhist temples, Taoist temples, they all came together, just like today. And I think we need to keep that spirit."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01107,2023-11-06-T-011,1107,Keith Chua,It is indeed precious that Singapore has worked hard at achieving and maintaining religious and societal harmony. We cannot afford to lose this.
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01108,2023-11-06-T-011,1108,Keith Chua,"Singapore and Israel have enjoyed many decades of friendly relations. We are grateful for the support when we were in the early stages of nationhood and for assistance in training and building up our armed forces. Today, there are strong economic ties in many areas with Israel. Israel is a leader in the digital space."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01109,2023-11-06-T-011,1109,Keith Chua,"My fellow hon Member Mr Neil Parekh has asked about the safeguarding of our business, investment and research interests in Israel. May I add that while we look at this from the Singapore perspective, we will also recognise that trade and investment remains a vital lifeline for Israel in her current struggle. Wars are costly both in terms of human lives and in economic terms."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01110,2023-11-06-T-011,1110,Keith Chua,"Much has been said, the current situation has immediate needs for humanitarian aid and relief. Singapore started by contributing an initial seed amount from the Government of $300,000, and as updated by the Minister earlier, about $5 million in total has now been received, and many other initiatives are also underway."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01111,2023-11-06-T-011,1111,Keith Chua,"I would like to express deep appreciation to the Mufti of Singapore and the Chief Rabbi of Singapore. Drawing extracts from their letters released publicly, the Mufti of Singapore wrote  ""There is no place and no justification for any form of violence and brutality on civilians by anyone, including by Hamas, or in any retaliatory response. The right to civilians to live peacefully must be protected at all times."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01112,2023-11-06-T-011,1112,Keith Chua,"In response, the Chief Rabbi wrote  ""Our hearts and prayers are also with innocent Palestinian civilians who have lost their lives in this senseless conflict, and we do hope and pray for a peaceful and long-lasting solution to this war and a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinian people, as elusive as it might seem at this moment."""
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01113,2023-11-06-T-011,1113,Keith Chua,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say again, Singapore must do everything to preserve our unique religious and racial harmony. The Israel-Hamas war must not be allowed to divide our society."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01114,2023-11-06-T-011,1114,Keith Chua,"It is important that we stick to the correct information. It may become necessary to combat misinformation especially on this conflict. Our political leaders need to ensure that there is a clear flow of accurate information, continue to uphold the law and to protect all races. Religious leaders must do everything in their means to give correct guidance as ultimately all faiths subscribe to the principles of love, respect, kindness, compassion and peace."
2023-11-06-T-011-S-01115,2023-11-06-T-011,1115,Keith Chua,"Fellow Christians in Singapore are deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives in this conflict and by the suffering that inevitably accompanies conflict. The National Council of Churches of Singapore has called the churches in Singapore to pray for the Israel-Palestinian conflict. We are praying for the alleviation of suffering in every form, for peace to come quickly and for governments, including our Government, to intervene in appropriate ways in finding the way to peace. Along with the other faiths, Christians in Singapore are grateful for the religious harmony we experience in Singapore and will keep playing our part to uphold this. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion and the amended Motion."

2023-11-06-T-013-S-01120,2023-11-06-T-013,1120,Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion and its proposed amendments. This is a very difficult speech for me. Difficult, because I speak firstly as a human being, but also, equally so, as a Singaporean."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01121,2023-11-06-T-013,1121,Xie Yao Quan,"And so, while I express my grief and dismay at the lives lost and blood shed and homes destroyed on both sides, but especially in the Gaza Strip, where a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in this escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, while I express my grief and dismay at the situation, I am also deeply cognisant about the need for me to keep my sight clearly on our national interests. Our national interests, in a humanitarian and political crisis embroiling our brothers and sisters in another part of the world. And equally so, the important need for all Singaporeans to have a consensus and common view on our national interests."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01122,2023-11-06-T-013,1122,Xie Yao Quan,"So, while I fully support the resolution passed by the 10th Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 27 October 2023 calling for, I quote, ""an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities"", so as to allow the ""full, immediate, safe, unhindered and sustained access to humanitarian aid to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population in the Gaza Strip"", and while I am proud of Singapore's vote in favour of this resolution, let us also be very clear."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01123,2023-11-06-T-013,1123,Xie Yao Quan,"The right to self defence is cardinal, and sacrosanct, especially to a small state like Singapore, and Singapore's vote in favour of a cessation of hostilities, and in favour of a resolution that glaringly omits an affirmation of the right to self defence, in no way diminishes, or signals a softening of Singapore's position on our sacrosanct right to self defence."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01124,2023-11-06-T-013,1124,Xie Yao Quan,"I want to make this point, and I am glad that I have heard both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister make the point, but I thought it is important that I also make the point as a backbencher, because I sense that there are some questions amongst our communities about what our vote in the UN means in terms of where we stand on our right to self defence."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01125,2023-11-06-T-013,1125,Xie Yao Quan,"As our Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor – he has been quoted many times today – put it in his intervention at the Special Session, ""every country…has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure."""
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01126,2023-11-06-T-013,1126,Xie Yao Quan,"This is close to my heart, not only as a Singaporean, but also as a National Serviceman who has been serving in various parts of the Singapore Armed Forces. In our training and exercises, my fellow commanders, planners and I constantly grapple with the fundamental intersection between military operations, international humanitarian law and strategic political objectives."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01127,2023-11-06-T-013,1127,Xie Yao Quan,"But we are clear, and there should be no doubt, also, I think, about where all Singaporeans should stand on this. If we are ever called upon one day to defend ourselves, our people and our territory against the attacks of an adversary, whether state or non-state, we will do what we need to do. And we will apply our military power to secure our existence, if that is what it takes."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01128,2023-11-06-T-013,1128,Xie Yao Quan,"On this note, let us also be clear on another point. What Hamas did in Southern Israel on 7 October 2023 are acts of terror. Enough has been said in this House, I am not going to belabour the point. I just want to say that I am glad to hear that we have strong consensus in this House. It is in our absolute national interest to have a clear consensus in this House on this point."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01129,2023-11-06-T-013,1129,Xie Yao Quan,"I would like to say too, that this consensus is a big deal. It matters, because in the UN General Assembly 10th Emergency Special Session, Canada did propose an amendment to resolution that was passed, to also ""unequivocally reject and condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages""."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01130,2023-11-06-T-013,1130,Xie Yao Quan,"Unfortunately, this amendment did not pass, with 55 votes against and 23 abstentions. So, the international community is split in its views on not just the condemnation of Hamas' attacks on 7 October as acts of terror, but even the characterisation and recognition of such acts as acts of terror."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01131,2023-11-06-T-013,1131,Xie Yao Quan,"Our language and our words do matter, they matter on the international stage, they matter here at home. The international community could not agree on the language and the words to use, but Singapore cast a strong vote in the UN in favour of that amendment proposed by Canada, and again, I am glad in this House, we have strong consensus on this basic point. I hope, as a next stage, all Singaporeans outside of this House will be unified in our view on this point. Because if what Hamas did on 7 October 2023 were to happen to us, we would want these acts to be recognised and condemned unequivocally as terrorist attacks."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01132,2023-11-06-T-013,1132,Xie Yao Quan,"Finally, let us be clear on a third point. Israel's ongoing military operations in the Gaza Strip do violate the resolution passed by the UN Special Session. Israel has, so far, failed to take steps towards an immediate humanitarian truce, which is in contravention of the resolution. Israel continues to prevent the full, immediate, safe, unhindered and sustained access to humanitarian aid to ensure the survival of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip – again, in contravention of the resolution."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01133,2023-11-06-T-013,1133,Xie Yao Quan,"And Israel has not rescinded its order for Palestinian civilians and humanitarian workers to evacuate all areas in the Gaza Strip north of the Wadi Gaza and relocate to south Gaza – again, in contravention of the resolution."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01134,2023-11-06-T-013,1134,Xie Yao Quan,"Israel should comply fully with the UN resolution, as it should, too, with previous UN resolutions on occupied territories and settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. These are all UN resolutions that Singapore has consistently supported. It is in our interest that UN resolutions are respected and complied with, as it upholds, preserves and strengthens the multi-lateral rule-based system that is so critical to us. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01135,2023-11-06-T-013,1135,Xie Yao Quan,"(In Mandarin)  The United Nations Special Emergency Meeting on the Israel-Hamas war passed a resolution calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian ceasefire by both sides, to facilitate the cessation of hostilities. Singapore supports this resolution at the United Nations."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01136,2023-11-06-T-013,1136,Xie Yao Quan,"I support Singapore's position for two reasons. Firstly, the situation unfolding in Gaza is, undoubtedly, a human tragedy and a humanitarian catastrophe. It is saddening. Both sides of the conflict and the international community have a duty to immediately ensure basic protection and humanitarian aid for civilians."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01137,2023-11-06-T-013,1137,Xie Yao Quan,"Secondly, modern warfare is not like ancient warfare. In modern warfare, while fighting is ongoing, humanity and humanitarianism is also emphasised. The more powerful the killing power of modern weapons, the more countries have an obligation and responsibility to uphold basic humanity. This is the fundamental principle and spirit of today's international humanitarian law and laws of war."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01138,2023-11-06-T-013,1138,Xie Yao Quan,"International law is crucial for Singapore as it is a small country. Singapore's support for the UN resolution is support for international law. However, we must also emphasise that the UN resolution does not mention a country's right to self-defence under international law. The resolution also does not clearly condemn Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01139,2023-11-06-T-013,1139,Xie Yao Quan,"These two points touch on Singapore's core national security interest. Therefore, we must be clear that supporting the UN resolution does not mean that Singapore's position on the right to self-defend has weakened, nor does it mean that Singapore's position on terrorism has wavered. Singapore must strongly condemn any terrorist acts against innocent civilians."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01140,2023-11-06-T-013,1140,Xie Yao Quan,"Finally, this is likely to be a long-drawn war. In our country, different groups may hold strong and differing views on the Israel-Palestine issue. But we must ensure that international events like these will not divide us. We must maintain our hard-earned multiracial and multi religious harmony that we have enjoyed over the years."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01141,2023-11-06-T-013,1141,Xie Yao Quan,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, ultimately, I think all of us Singaporeans want peace and stability and the cessation of human suffering in this tragic conflict – not only between Israel and Hamas, but in the larger, long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It requires strategic wisdom, on both sides, as Minister Vivian has said, both the Israeli political leadership, and the Palestinian Authority."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01142,2023-11-06-T-013,1142,Xie Yao Quan,"Strategic wisdom, to see that attacks and counter-attacks, retaliation and retribution, will only harden hearts and harden the path to a durable, just and comprehensive negotiated two-state solution. Restraint is the much more difficult, much less instinctive, but much more plausible path to peace. It requires strategic wisdom. And I urge for strategic wisdom too, to see that urgent action is needed. Urgent leadership and political organisation and action on both sides, is needed, in order for peace to have a chance, any chance."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01143,2023-11-06-T-013,1143,Xie Yao Quan,"For the sake of millions of children, Palestinian and Israeli, Arab and Jewish, born and yet unborn, I hope both sides will do the right things, urgently, for peace."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01144,2023-11-06-T-013,1144,Speaker,Dr Wan Rizal.
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01145,2023-11-06-T-013,1145,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the amended Motion. Amid the calm of our peaceful nation, we hear the distant cries of despair from the Israel-Hamas conflict, touching our hearts with sorrow and empathy. The humanitarian crisis unfolds not as a tally of numbers but as stories of human lives, each with a face, a name and a story. As a father of four children, the anguish and despair engulfing the innocent children caught in this conflict resonates with me on a profound level. It is a painful reminder of the cost of conflict. We stand in solidarity with all the innocent civilians caught in this turmoil."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01146,2023-11-06-T-013,1146,Wan Rizal,"Sir, the dire situation in Gaza demands more than words; it calls for a global conscience. The lack of clean water, food, medical supplies and energy is a stark reality that demands immediate action. Singapore's support for UN humanitarian efforts, voiced assertively at the UN General Assembly, is underpinned by our commitment to international law and a multilateral rules-based order. In our consistent navigation of the Israel-Palestine issue, Singapore's principled stance, through the UN resolutions, as shared by Minister Vivian, has been unflinching. And I appreciate this. It mirrors our belief in dialogue over destruction, in peaceful negotiation over persistent conflict. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01147,2023-11-06-T-013,1147,Wan Rizal,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Sir, our words and actions today reflect the humanitarian values that we hold firmly. The Israel-Hamas conflict is a test of our humanitarian conscience, reminding us of the loss, pain, and hope experienced by the people of Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01148,2023-11-06-T-013,1148,Wan Rizal,Every moment without humanitarian aid is a moment that steals a brighter future from the people of Gaza.
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01149,2023-11-06-T-013,1149,Wan Rizal,"In Singapore, the Malay/Muslim community feels this sadness more keenly. Our hearts break thinking about those affected, and we urge immediate humanitarian action and a peaceful solution to the ongoing situation."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01150,2023-11-06-T-013,1150,Wan Rizal,"Sir, we have had a consistent stand in UN resolutions since 1967. In 2017, we voted against Jerusalem being made the capital of Israel. In 2022, we were against the illegal settlements by Israel and asserted that it was against international law."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01151,2023-11-06-T-013,1151,Wan Rizal,"Recently, we have supported a resolution that calls for an immediate humanitarian assistance and provision of essential supplies to civilians in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01152,2023-11-06-T-013,1152,Wan Rizal,"Two weeks ago, Minister Shanmugam held a dialogue session with more than 200 Malay/Muslim community leaders. This dialogue has explained the Government's position and addressed some of the misinformation floating around in cyberspace. Many appreciated the dialogue session as it gave a clearer picture of this issue."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01153,2023-11-06-T-013,1153,Wan Rizal,"My hope is that the Government will continue to reach out to the community, giving room to listen to their grievances, accept suggestions and feedback, and give appropriate explanations."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01154,2023-11-06-T-013,1154,Wan Rizal,"We should explain how Singapore, as a small country, plays a crucial role on the global stage to promote peace and humanity. This is our responsibility, to help our community better understand and prepare for future challenges."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01155,2023-11-06-T-013,1155,Wan Rizal,"(In English)  Sir, in English, please. Over the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of engaging a number of youths, as well as members from M3 at Jalan Besar. Many asked how long will this conflict last? What does it take for this conflict to end? What constitutes a war crime? And what actions will the international community take now or once the dust literally settles?"
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01156,2023-11-06-T-013,1156,Wan Rizal,"I share their sentiments and concerns and I am heartened that this issue resonates deeply with them. Among our youths, regardless of race, the empathy and concern reflects the kind of humanity and spirit that bodes well for our future."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01157,2023-11-06-T-013,1157,Wan Rizal,"Sir, in today's digital age, the conflict has also seen a myriad of narratives being shared on social media platforms. While these platforms can bridge understanding and foster solidarity, they can also breed misinformation and discord. The rapid spread of both information and misinformation has a significant impact shaping perceptions and emotions."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01158,2023-11-06-T-013,1158,Wan Rizal,"This underscores the need for digital literacy and critical thinking in discerning the truth amidst the sea of conflicting narratives. Moreover, the phenomenon of doom-scrolling where individuals continuously scroll through distressing news on social media has risen. This not only reflects our global interconnectedness, but also brings to the four mental health challenges that such crisis and their digital portrayal can precipitate."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01159,2023-11-06-T-013,1159,Wan Rizal,"Thus, it is imperative that we take steps to address the mental health impact by accelerating digital literacy, encouraging balance media consumption and providing mental health support through safe spaces for this course."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01160,2023-11-06-T-013,1160,Wan Rizal,"In this vein, I am heartened to witness our Mufti being the first to provide support to the Jewish community, as well as the asatizahs, our local religious leaders such as Ustaz Mizi Wahid taking proactive steps to provide much needed holistic guidance and support for the Malay/Muslim community. Their efforts are crucial in navigating the emotional and informational landscape ensuring our community remains well informed, resilient and united during this trying times."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01161,2023-11-06-T-013,1161,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, the vibrancy of all communities' response to this crisis is a testament of the Singaporean spirit. The recent dialogue session with the Malay/Muslim leaders is a prime example. It was a constructive discourse that reflected our unique way of addressing global issues – the Singaporean way. I am reminded of darker days when the spectre of terrorism loom large with the Jemaah Islamiyah threat."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01162,2023-11-06-T-013,1162,Wan Rizal,"It was a time when the fabric of our social harmony was put to the test. Yet, Singaporeans from all walks of life, regardless of race or religion rallied together. Religious organisations across the spectrum step forward to support the Malay/Muslim community. This is the hallmark of our society, a reflection of mutual respect and solidarity that binds us together."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01163,2023-11-06-T-013,1163,Wan Rizal,"Sir, in conclusion my hope is simple. The international law be abided with and followed through. As we stand in unison with the innocent civilian lives caught in the crossfire of the Israel-Hamas conflict, let us also stand united in our resolve to uphold values of peace, justice and humanitarianism. Let the narrative of solidarity security and peace resonate across our lands, reminding us of our shared responsibility towards fostering a harmonious community."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01164,2023-11-06-T-013,1164,Speaker,Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim.
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01165,2023-11-06-T-013,1165,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the amended Motion."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01166,2023-11-06-T-013,1166,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The loss of innocent lives in Israel and Gaza has shaken all of us. I am sure I speak on behalf of all Singaporeans, when I say that we feel the grief and pain of those who have lost their loved ones. As the conflict in Gaza intensifies, we also watch with great concern the tremendous suffering of innocent civilians – babies, young children, the sick and the elderly."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01167,2023-11-06-T-013,1167,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"With food, water and medical aid not reaching the people, this humanitarian crisis will worsen. We are already reading reports of emergency surgeries being conducted without anesthesia. This is the tragic price of conflict – the loss and suffering of innocent lives. It is heart-wrenching and our thoughts and prayers are with all of them."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01168,2023-11-06-T-013,1168,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The long-standing Israel-Palestine conflict is an emotive issue. This latest outbreak of hostilities has led to a global rise in hate speech, crimes and attacks. Mr Alex Yam asked if there have been increased reports of anti-Semitic rhetoric or inter-religious disagreements in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01169,2023-11-06-T-013,1169,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"As mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Wong earlier, in the month of October 2023 alone, the Singapore Police Force received eight reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at either members of the Jewish or Muslim communities in Singapore. This is equal to the total number of anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim police reports received between January and September this year."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01170,2023-11-06-T-013,1170,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We take firm action against acts that threaten our racial and religious harmony. We have provisions to do so in the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and Penal Code. We also have powers under the Broadcasting Act to disable access to egregious content, including those likely to cause racial or religious disharmony in Singapore, or which advocate violence or terrorism."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01171,2023-11-06-T-013,1171,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The laws are only one part of our holistic approach to maintaining racial and religious harmony in our society. We work closely with the community. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) regularly engage our religious and community leaders through platforms such as the National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01172,2023-11-06-T-013,1172,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"MCCY has refreshed the 93 Racial and Religious Harmony Circles, one in each constituency, to build trust and interactions across our ethnic and religious communities. MCCY also uses the Harmony Fund to support community initiatives that bring different communities together, deepen their mutual understanding and foster meaningful conversations about their commonalities and differences."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01173,2023-11-06-T-013,1173,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Individuals who engage in offensive conduct are a minority in our society. Even where views on the conflict have differed, most Singaporeans have been measured and mature in our response. We may feel deep sympathy for the civilians caught in the crossfire between Israel and Hamas. However, we should be mindful that just as there are those among us who feel more deeply for the Israelis killed or abducted by Hamas, there are also many Singaporeans who are profoundly saddened by the sufferings of the Palestinian people in Gaza."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01174,2023-11-06-T-013,1174,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We should therefore show our support and concern, in a way which does not lead to conflict and tensions among us and is not framed as a clash between religions. Whether it is an Israeli or Palestinian life, it is still a life, and we should be concerned and should be willing to give help."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01175,2023-11-06-T-013,1175,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We understand that Singaporeans desire to come together to show their concern and support. Some have applied to hold assemblies at the Speakers' Corner. Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi asked about applications to use the Speakers' Corner for such events. Over the last three years, NParks has received more than 400 applications to use the Speakers' Corner for events. Of these, seven applications were rejected. Five of the rejected applications were to hold events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict in October 2023. The two remaining applications were for unrelated events in December 2022 and August 2023."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01176,2023-11-06-T-013,1176,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The Singapore Police Force (SPF) has said that public assemblies on matters related to the Israel-Hamas conflict will be prohibited. There are real public safety and security concerns. There have been numerous incidents of violence related to the conflict in other countries. Tensions are high and public demonstrations may inevitably advocate or show more sympathy for one side of the conflict or the other. They can spark off incidents on the ground. They also have the potential to divide us as Singaporeans. Once we allow one event, we will have to allow others."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01177,2023-11-06-T-013,1177,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Our position is consistent with previous requests for events held outside the Speakers' Corner, where the SPF had assessed there to be a safety and security risk, such as those related to the Russia-Ukraine war. We would have adopted the same approach if the event was held at Speakers' Corner. NParks will continue to reject applications to use the Speakers’ Corner for such events, as long as there is a public safety and security risk."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01178,2023-11-06-T-013,1178,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"There are other practical and impactful avenues through which Singaporeans can show support. They may, for example, contribute to authorised fundraising activities and donation drives in support of humanitarian relief efforts, such as the fund-raising appeal by the Singapore Red Cross."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01179,2023-11-06-T-013,1179,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Alex Yam asked whether there has been an increase in rhetoric or activities by extremist groups in the Southeast Asian region. Hamas has issued statements calling on all Muslims to fight. Supporters of terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as those in Southeast Asia, have celebrated Hamas' attacks. They have called on followers to join in a wider jihad."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01180,2023-11-06-T-013,1180,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Singaporeans are not immune to such sentiments. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned the individuals we had detained in the past. Our stance is clear – we condemn all acts of terrorism. Terrorism is not justifiable under any circumstances. Neither will we tolerate people calling for violence. We will take firm action.
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01181,2023-11-06-T-013,1181,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Our security agencies are watching the situation very closely and have stepped up their alert. Additional measures have been taken, such as enhanced security patrols at certain events and places. Singaporeans, on their part, must stay vigilant. They should report to the authorities any suspicious behaviour or individuals whom they suspect could have been radicalised. Mr Speaker, our strongest defence is our collective vigilance."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01182,2023-11-06-T-013,1182,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, again, in line with Singapore's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and our support of international law as well as the two-state solution, I support the Motion raised by Members of Parliament Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. [Applause.]"
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01183,2023-11-06-T-013,1183,Speaker,"Before I call hon Members to ask their supplementary questions and clarifications, I wish to make an observation and give a reminder to this House."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01184,2023-11-06-T-013,1184,Speaker,"I note that in the past, Members have taken this opportunity for raising points of clarification to make mini-speeches before asking their clarifications. In fact, there has been an occasion where the mini-speech exceeded five minutes. So, I want to remind Members that under Standing Order 48(3), no Member other than the mover is allowed to speak more than once on a Motion. Making a point of clarification or asking supplementary questions are not further occasions for a second speech. I will allow some leeway for Members to explain their point of clarification or make their question intelligible, but I ask Members for your cooperation and understanding to observe the Standing Orders and to keep your points of clarifications and questions concise and to the point."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01185,2023-11-06-T-013,1185,Speaker,"With that, are there any clarifications or supplementary questions? None? In that case, I will now call on Mr Vikram Nair."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01186,2023-11-06-T-013,1186,Vikram Nair,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank all my colleagues who took part in this debate including our Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of State for Home Affairs who set out the Government's perspective."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01187,2023-11-06-T-013,1187,Vikram Nair,"It was also good to have perspectives from the backbench, from our Nominated Members and from both Opposition parties. I am heartened by the significant agreement on important matters by all parties concerned. So, the good news is I will not be using anywhere close to my full 40 minutes."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01188,2023-11-06-T-013,1188,Vikram Nair,"WP has in this House clarified that their position is similar to the Government's on all the key points, including that they condemn the terrorist attacks on 7 October and recognise Israel's right of self defence. This is important because it was not clear from their public statement, but I am grateful that the opposition has clarified that the public statement may also be modified. I also thank Mr Leong Mun Wai and the PSP for its unequivocal support of our Motion and the Government's position on this matter."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01189,2023-11-06-T-013,1189,Vikram Nair,"There is so much common ground among the speakers here that I think what I will do in this speech, in line with this Motion, is show the solidarity amongst us."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01190,2023-11-06-T-013,1190,Vikram Nair,"On the first component, I think everyone who spoke understands and empathises both with the suffering of the Israeli people who are victims of the attack as well as with the plight of the Palestinian people. I think many speakers also express sympathy for the Palestinian cause, which may have been compromised, unfortunately, by this attack."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01191,2023-11-06-T-013,1191,Vikram Nair,"The second and third components of this debate are where we give substance to the humanitarian crisis. There was a UN resolution passed for immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce and a call for cessation, leading to the cessation of hostilities. This was, I quote, by all Members in this House and all parties, and I think this is important. Even Israel's close ally, like the US, is calling for a truce so that humanitarian supplies can reach the people."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01192,2023-11-06-T-013,1192,Vikram Nair,"And this builds onto the third component and some people, including Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Mr Alex Yam, Dr Syed Harun and Mr Sharael Taha, share moving stories about the humanitarian plight and of the suffering of the civilian population. We think it is important for the people to get access to humanitarian assistance being provided by the UN, the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01193,2023-11-06-T-013,1193,Vikram Nair,"The fourth component – condemning those responsible for the terrorist attacks and violation of international law. This is an important point for Singapore. And the Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers, Second Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Mr Zhulkarnain, Mr Sharael Taha, have all pointed out that we have to unequivocally call out these terrorist attacks and label it as such because such attacks cannot be condoned. And I think Mr Xie Yao Quan also highlighted that the right of self defence that correlates and arises from this is also important to recognise."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01194,2023-11-06-T-013,1194,Vikram Nair,"The second component – the violations of international law. This also has to be condemned, regardless of which party is responsible, and the relevant principles of international law include the principles applicable to arm conflict including the principle of distinction, which means civilians and civilian objects cannot be made targets of military attack; proportionality, which means any response has to be proportionate to the threat; as well as positive obligations to protect civilians and civilian objects from the effects of war. These are all important obligations. I also agree with Mr Zhulkarnain's call for both parties to facilitate investigations after the war, if necessary. It is important for both parties who wish to maintain the moral high ground to show that they intend to and respect international law."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01195,2023-11-06-T-013,1195,Vikram Nair,"The next limb, which calls for all parties to comply with positive obligation under humanitarian law, including to ensure the safety and security of civilians, release all hostages and minimise the effects of combat on the civilian population. There is some overlap between this and the earlier limbs, but I think the call for release of hostages is also universal. There is no excuse for keeping hostages and they have to be released immediately. The steps taken to protect the civilian population from the effects of war, I would respectfully say, include compliance with the UN resolution and facilitating humanitarian access to the agencies involved."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01196,2023-11-06-T-013,1196,Vikram Nair,"We then come to another point in which there was universal agreement and that is Singapore's long-standing commitment to a two-state solution. This commitment goes back a long way. I think in my speech, I highlighted that it traces back to 1967, and I think Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also highlighted Singapore's record of votes at the UN to show how we have always been consistent with this. We have voted to indicate also that Israel's policies of starting settlements in the Occupied Territories are illegal and we maintain this position. We acknowledge that this policy of settlement is an obstacle to the peace process and the eventual creation of a Palestinian state."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01197,2023-11-06-T-013,1197,Vikram Nair,"To Israel's credit though, they did take action to move out of the Gaza, including moving settlers out in 2005. So, in my view, this is not an insurmountable obstacle, but I think it is one that should be acknowledged."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01198,2023-11-06-T-013,1198,Vikram Nair,"I think Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong set out that if we are to get a peaceful resolution, Palestinians must be given a peaceful alternative to achieve statehood. Otherwise, they may continue to support groups like Hamas that promote violence. So, for the two-state solution to become a reality, I think we have to hope that both parties and the peaceful leaders on both sides will be able to have a stronger position."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01199,2023-11-06-T-013,1199,Vikram Nair,"Singapore is not a big player in this situation and Singapore probably cannot individually move the needle on this, but I think many speakers have pointed out that Singapore has a good relationship with both Israel and Palestine. And we have taken a consistent position with both. With the Palestinians, several speakers including Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Dr Maliki and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the efforts that we have taken to engage in capacity building with the Palestinian Authority, and to continue to help them build up their skills."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01200,2023-11-06-T-013,1200,Vikram Nair,"It was also interesting to note that Dr Vivian Balakrishnan was in contact with his Egyptian counterpart, and this is to facilitate the movement of aid to the Gaza. Dr Maliki is going to Cairo himself. These are big commitments on the part of a small country to have such high-level people involved in doing what little we can to facilitate the peace process. Singapore has no power over either of the parties. All we can hope to do is lend our voice."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01201,2023-11-06-T-013,1201,Vikram Nair,Let me come to the last component of this and that is to urge all Singaporeans to safeguard and uphold our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony.
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01202,2023-11-06-T-013,1202,Vikram Nair,"Both Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Faisal Ibrahim highlighted the complaints about hate crimes have been on the rise in Singapore, although the numbers are still small while Mr Raj Joshua Thomas highlighted a rise in hate crimes across the world and indicated that Singapore may also be vulnerable. This means there is a real threat to Singapore's harmony that could arise from this, if we are not careful. Minister of State Fasial also highlighted that there are calls by Hamas for regional recruitment."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01203,2023-11-06-T-013,1203,Vikram Nair,"Several speakers, including Mr Alex Yam, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Gerald Giam have highlighted that online misinformation targeting Singaporeans has been on the rise and Dr Wan Rizal has introduced me to a new term, ""doom-scrolling"", the continued consumption of negative news."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01204,2023-11-06-T-013,1204,Vikram Nair,"So, I think, against this backdrop, it is important that all parties in this House acknowledged the need for Singapore to stay united. Each of us, as leaders, must do our part to fight this misinformation. While some Singaporeans have strong sentiment on the matter, we should not get these feelings divide us."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01205,2023-11-06-T-013,1205,Vikram Nair,"I am grateful for Dr Maliki sharing of the Government's effort to fight misinformation, including with programmes in schools and I think one of the most heartening examples highlighted in this House by Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Mr Keith Chua, Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Nadia Samdin, amongst others, was position taken by two important leaders, the Chief Rabbi and the Mufti."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01206,2023-11-06-T-013,1206,Vikram Nair,"After the attack, the Mufti Ustaz Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir in his letter, ""There is no place and no justification for any form of violence and brutality on civilians by anyone, including by Hamas, or in any retaliatory response."""
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01207,2023-11-06-T-013,1207,Vikram Nair,"He also offered his sincerest condolences, prayers and solidarity to those whose lives are unjustly taken. He also expressed his wish for peaceful co-existence of both communities. In response, the Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel said he was encouraged by the Mufti's letter and said he was grateful for Singapore's zero tolerance laws on hate speech and added that the utmost priority is for our communities to come together."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01208,2023-11-06-T-013,1208,Vikram Nair,"This crucial exchange sends a strong message and I hope members of both faiths and all other faiths in Singapore will take this message of solidarity and unity. But these actions are not just from the leaders, they seem to go quite a way down."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01209,2023-11-06-T-013,1209,Vikram Nair,"I think many of our Malay/Muslim Members of Parliament shared the efforts of the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation raising funds in Singapore, the grassroot levels but they were joined by other faiths as well as Mr Keith Chua highlighted contributions from Humanity Matters – churches, Buddhist temples, Sikh temples, Hindu temples, all coming together in support."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01210,2023-11-06-T-013,1210,Vikram Nair,"This, I think, is a good example of the Singapore way. The different faiths stand in solidarity together even when there are differences amongst people in other countries that could otherwise divide us."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01211,2023-11-06-T-013,1211,Vikram Nair,"I am grateful to this House and all its Members for standing in solidarity for peace and security in the Middle East. I beg to move, Sir."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01212,2023-11-06-T-013,1212,Speaker,"Any Members have any clarifications for Mr Nair? If not, we have now come to the conclusion of the debate and I shall put the questions to the House for a decision."
2023-11-06-T-013-S-01213,2023-11-06-T-013,1213,Speaker,We have five amendments proposed by Mr Alex Yam. We will deal with the amendments first.

2023-11-06-T-014-S-01236,2023-11-06-T-014,1236,Zaqy Mohamad,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01237,2023-11-06-T-014,1237,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, let me begin by commending Singapore's long-standing commitment to the safety and well-being of our children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01238,2023-11-06-T-014,1238,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"In 2019, Singapore ranked first in the Global Childhood Report, surpassing Western European nations. We also excel in keeping children safe online, ranking 4th out of 30 countries in the Child Online Safety Index in 2020."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01239,2023-11-06-T-014,1239,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Singapore is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the best interests principle guides all of our policies and services for children. We have made substantial progress in child protection and children's rights, as illustrated in our 2019 report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Amendments to the Children and Young Persons Act, robust screening and reporting tools, the establishment of the Family Justice Courts and investments in Early Childhood Education are just some of our other achievements."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01240,2023-11-06-T-014,1240,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"We continue to receive international attention and praise for our success as a nation and public safety and security is at the heart of everything we do. Singapore is forward looking, and we do this well. We are experts at monitoring our landscape, anticipating changes, and planning for the future."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01241,2023-11-06-T-014,1241,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, in October of this year, the Forward Singapore report was released. The report describes Singapore's road map for the next decade and beyond, and highlights the need to reimagine the Singapore Dream, refresh our social compact, and redefine success as seen from the lens of our younger generation. We are advancing towards creating a better future for Singapore and we are doing this in consultation with the people of Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01242,2023-11-06-T-014,1242,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"I am excited with this progress as this is home not just for me, but also for my children and their children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01243,2023-11-06-T-014,1243,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"As we evolve, we want to ensure the progression of everyone, and especially our children. As a nation, we need to continue to promote and protect the safety and wellbeing of children, and to work together to nurture and support all children to reach their potential."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01244,2023-11-06-T-014,1244,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"On that note, let me take you on an adventure, through the lens of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" that resonates with my Adjournment Motion, ""Child Safety and Well-being  A Collective Responsibility""."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01245,2023-11-06-T-014,1245,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, as many in this House may recall, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, magic pervades the story; but, in reality, the magic is Alice's power to dream. And I believe there is no limitation when it comes to dreams."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01246,2023-11-06-T-014,1246,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, I stand here, not just as an educator or a social worker, but also as a believer in dreams; and one inspired by the many stories of success that I have heard over the years from under-privileged children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01247,2023-11-06-T-014,1247,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,Many of these children succeeded despite great hardship and their success reminds me of the need to set goals and work diligently towards a dreamt future.
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01248,2023-11-06-T-014,1248,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"As social workers, we operate with a clear vision in mind, and the safety and wellbeing of our clients is our paramount consideration. We also believe in establishing clear goals, for our clients, and it is timely for me to share my favourite quote from Alice in Wonderland  ""If you don't know where you are going, any road can take you there."""
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01249,2023-11-06-T-014,1249,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Since 1999, when I was working as a social worker in a children's home and subsequently as a probation officer, I have observed many changes that illustrate Singapore's strong commitment to protecting children. We have come a long way, and I would like to commend the efforts taken by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), in driving these changes, and for constantly reviewing our social compact. Most importantly, I would like to acknowledge the good work done by those who work with children. In protecting and nurturing them."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01250,2023-11-06-T-014,1250,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"At this juncture, I would like to share another quote from Alice in Wonderland, where the Queen says to Alice  ""Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"""
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01251,2023-11-06-T-014,1251,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"While Singapore has undoubtedly done well, today's Adjournment Motion is about moving forward. And, as the Queen encourages Alice, we need to run at least twice as fast. I would, however, like to stress that this is not merely about running quickly and arriving breathless. This Motion is about defining a goal, setting a steady pace, and arriving at our destination composed and confident."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01252,2023-11-06-T-014,1252,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"This Motion is also about considering the principles that augment Singapore's efforts in safeguarding children, adopting a collective responsibility and articulating a united direction and methodology to ensure a better future for our children and our nation."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01253,2023-11-06-T-014,1253,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, despite all best efforts, children do get hurt. They may fall off a swing in a playground, they may be bullied at school, or they may get abused or harmed by someone close to them."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01254,2023-11-06-T-014,1254,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"It is unrealistic to expect a world entirely free from such complexities. Risk is multifaceted, and there is no single solution that can entirely reduce the presence of risk, or harm from happening. However, each of us has a role to play – and it begins with family. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01255,2023-11-06-T-014,1255,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] As we know, and we continue to strengthen this part of our social compact – family is our first line of defence. The family plays a significant role in nurturing and protecting a child. The traditional concept of family, however, is changing – from nuclear families, into reconstituted families or single-parent families or even the no-parent families – and this is a challenge, especially when it comes to differences in parenting and disciplinary style."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01256,2023-11-06-T-014,1256,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Most of us who are parents would agree that parenting is an adventure that comes with many surprises. Parenting demands interpersonal skills and emotional maturity. And yet, there is no one standard rule book for this. Parents tend to replicate the practices of their own parents, which can perpetuate both positive and negative parenting methods, leading to differences in viewpoints within marriages."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01257,2023-11-06-T-014,1257,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"We know from studies that inadequate preparation for parental roles contributes to problems like child abuse, neglect and strained parent-child relationships."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01258,2023-11-06-T-014,1258,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"In Singapore, most parents need to work to support the family and many of us rely on extended families, helpers and childcare facilities. And yet, the involvement from both parents is crucial in ensuring safety and wellbeing of our children. There is also a greater need for fathers to play a role in child upbringing and this also requires support given to working mothers to balance their role within the home as a wife, mother and excel in their career aspiration."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01259,2023-11-06-T-014,1259,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"I am proud that we have various initiatives to strengthen parenting, and create a Singapore made for families. On that note, as we develop our measures, we should consider ways to incorporate our gotong-royong spirit, and preserve our traditional family values of love, care and concern, filial responsibility and mutual respect."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01260,2023-11-06-T-014,1260,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, I would now like to suggest three initiatives to assist Singapore to take the next step in promoting and protecting the safety and wellbeing of our children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01261,2023-11-06-T-014,1261,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"First, Mr Speaker, a national framework for protecting children is a document that clearly articulates how the Government, the social services and the private sector can work together to ensure that children and young people in Singapore reach their full potential by growing up safe and supported and free from harm and neglect."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01262,2023-11-06-T-014,1262,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"National frameworks are not just idealistic policy statements, they set clear targets, measurable outcomes and realistic timelines. A national framework will ensure that the best interests of children are at the centre of decision-making and will reaffirm Singapore's commitment to making our nation the best place in the world for children to live and thrive."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01263,2023-11-06-T-014,1263,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Importantly, national frameworks are not designed to address one-off incidents or issues but reflect a systematic, long-term approach to improving the safety and well-being of our children. In Singapore, most children do okay, most of the time. A national framework will help all children do okay, all the time."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01264,2023-11-06-T-014,1264,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, national frameworks or their equivalent already exist in many other countries and have been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of children and their families, including, in particular, disadvantaged children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01265,2023-11-06-T-014,1265,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Second, introduce child impact assessments. Originating in Europe in the late 1980s, child impact assessments are a systematic and structured process to evaluate the impact of any proposed law, policy or programme on children. They ensure that decision-makers consider the specific needs and vulnerabilities of children when making decisions, they promote child-centered decision-making, they help governments create laws, policies and programmes that are responsive to the specific needs of children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01266,2023-11-06-T-014,1266,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,Child impact assessments have been endorsed by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and have been successfully implemented in several countries.
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01267,2023-11-06-T-014,1267,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Third, establish a dedicated office for children. Mr Speaker, many countries around the world have an office dedicated to the safety and well-being of children. In some countries, these take the form of a Children's Commissioner, a Children's Guardian or a Children's Ombudsman, or they may have a more targeted role such as a E-Safety Commissioner or a National Office for Child Safety."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01268,2023-11-06-T-014,1268,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"The first Children's Commissioner was established in Norway in 1981. Since then, a dedicated office for children has been established in more than 50 countries worldwide. Regardless of their title, what these offices have in common is that they are stand-alone agencies with a focus on promoting and protecting the safety and well-being of children, providing impartial advice to the government and advocating for the rights of children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01269,2023-11-06-T-014,1269,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Finally, I would like to suggest that we speak and listen to our children. Mr Speaker, I note that we have just concluded the Forward Singapore initiative. Forward Singapore was an opportunity for Singaporeans to come together and examine the nation's values and aspirations, build consensus and to refresh the social compact."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01270,2023-11-06-T-014,1270,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"As observed by former President Madam Halimah Yaacob when commenting on the initiative at the opening of the Second Session of the 14th Parliament on 10 April 2023, I quote, ""We want every person to be treated equally with dignity and respect. We want a Singapore where everyone belongs, and every citizen has the chance to achieve his or her fullest potential. We want a society that values and supports families; where we care for and help one another, and pitch in to make a difference to our community."""
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01271,2023-11-06-T-014,1271,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"As Singapore moves forward, we must speak and listen to our children. We need to bring together different groups of children, tap on their experiences and seek their views and opinions on how we can do things differently and do things better."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01272,2023-11-06-T-014,1272,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"In doing so, it is important that we engage with all children, not simply those who are already vocal or active within their community. We need to talk with children like those I met when I was a social worker and who told me repeatedly that they wanted to have a greater say in their future and the future of Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01273,2023-11-06-T-014,1273,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Referring to the wisdom of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, ""Let your need guide your behavior."""
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01274,2023-11-06-T-014,1274,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Sir, the safety and wellbeing of children is not merely a duty, it is a reflection of our commitment to a better tomorrow, where every child is treated with respect and dignity and where their potential knows no bounds. Our children are not merely extensions of ourselves but unique individuals with their own dreams and destinies. We, as a society, are entrusted with the responsibility of protecting and nurturing them, not to mould them into our image, but to help them flourish as the remarkable individuals they are."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01275,2023-11-06-T-014,1275,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"We must invest in their safety and well-being, not only because they deserve such care but because they hold the future of our nation in their hands. They are the architects of tomorrow, the visionaries who will shape our society and the stewards of our collective destiny."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01276,2023-11-06-T-014,1276,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"As we focus on their safety, health and growth, we must ensure that they have the strength and resilience to face the challenges of an ever-changing world. Let us remember that by protecting and nurturing our children, we are not just securing their future but also the future of our country, built upon the promise of their unique potential."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01277,2023-11-06-T-014,1277,Speaker,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua.
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01278,2023-11-06-T-014,1278,Eric Chua,"Mr Speaker, I thank Assoc Prof Razwana Begum for her speech."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01279,2023-11-06-T-014,1279,Eric Chua,"Indeed, we are united in our goal to advance our children's safety and well-being. In fact, it is this approach that enabled Singapore to make strides in online safety, education, security and child protection."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01280,2023-11-06-T-014,1280,Eric Chua,"In Singapore, our children are thriving. The National Council of Social Service surveys the quality of life of children and youths, using a common global standard. In its study published in 2022, our children and youths report a high quality of life, comparable to their peers in developed countries. In 2021, the UK charity Save the Children ranked Singapore as the top country where childhood is most protected."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01281,2023-11-06-T-014,1281,Eric Chua,"The Government has been and will continue to commit to ensure the safety and well-being of our children. We offer good, affordable and accessible healthcare to keep our children healthy. We also provide accessible, affordable and quality education that starts from preschool. We have developed national mental health and well-being strategies to address risks and promote mental health and well-being for youths with such concerns. We also have robust protocols and processes for our child protection ecosystem."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01282,2023-11-06-T-014,1282,Eric Chua,"From this strong foundation, we must indeed move forward for Singapore's children. In doing so, we must not forget that strong families are the bedrock of our efforts. Strong and resilient families nurture children to become strong individuals and active and compassionate members of our society."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01283,2023-11-06-T-014,1283,Eric Chua,"As families navigate various milestones in their life journey, we want to ensure parents are equipped with skills to build safe havens for their children."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01284,2023-11-06-T-014,1284,Eric Chua,Families can receive support from the Strengthening Families Programme @ Family Service Centres. These provide marriage support programmes for young couples and family counselling to help families navigate marital and parent-child relationship issues.
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01285,2023-11-06-T-014,1285,Eric Chua,"We give additional support to lower income parents through KidSTART. KidSTART equips parents with the knowledge and skills to nurture their children's development and helps them build stronger bonds with their children. KidSTART, which now comes under the larger umbrella of ComLink+, helps to better ensure that the needs of the children from lower-income households are met, in partnership with preschools and other community partners."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01286,2023-11-06-T-014,1286,Eric Chua,"Through ComLink+, we assign the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) family coaches to journey with these families and partner them in navigating life's challenges and seize opportunities to build a better future. Our ultimate goal is to enable ComLink+ families to achieve stability, self-reliance and, eventually, social mobility."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01287,2023-11-06-T-014,1287,Eric Chua,"To ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable children, MSF has strengthened information-sharing and coordination protocols with various touchpoints in the community."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01288,2023-11-06-T-014,1288,Eric Chua,"Frontline professionals in preschools, schools, healthcare institutions and social service agencies are trained to identify and report child abuse. The Break the Silence campaign educates and encourages the public to report suspected violence or neglect."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01289,2023-11-06-T-014,1289,Eric Chua,"To strengthen protection for family violence survivors, including children, the Family Violence (Amendment) Bill was passed in this House in July this year. The amendments strengthen powers for the Government to rehabilitate perpetrators, which is crucial to helping families reconcile once protection and safety for victim-survivors, including children, have been achieved."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01290,2023-11-06-T-014,1290,Eric Chua,"When parents continue to fail or are unable to keep their child safe, MSF's Child Protective Service (CPS) will intervene to remove the child as a last resort. CPS, together with relevant professionals and community partners, works to stabilise and rebuild family relationships so that the children can be safely reunited, wherever possible."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01291,2023-11-06-T-014,1291,Eric Chua,"We note the Member's suggestion to set up a dedicated Office for Child Safety. Our efforts over the years have helped to keep the incidence rates of child abuse low, at fewer than three for every 1,000 children. This is much lower compared to other countries, including those that have opted for a standalone Child Safety agency. For example, the incidence rate of children who experienced some form of maltreatment in 2021 was 21 per 1,000 children in Australia and 8.1 per 1,000 children in the United States."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01292,2023-11-06-T-014,1292,Eric Chua,"Today, we already have a specialised agency for child protection in the form of the Child Protective Service (CPS). At the same time, we recognise that child safety takes place in the context of a family situation. That is why the CPS is part of a larger Rehabilitation and Protection Group in MSF, which also includes the Adult Protective Service as well as the Probation and Community Rehabilitation Service, to help youths who are in the justice system."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01293,2023-11-06-T-014,1293,Eric Chua,"MSF will continue to work closely with agencies and community partners to detect, identify and provide care and support for child survivors of different forms of abuse."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01294,2023-11-06-T-014,1294,Eric Chua,"Our policies are also well coordinated in Singapore through an Inter-Ministry Committee that oversees the implementation of national policies relating to children and their progress. MSF, as the lead agency, works with other agencies to ensure that Singapore's policies and practices consider the child's best interests."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01295,2023-11-06-T-014,1295,Eric Chua,"We have explained this to the United Nations Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child in our reports to and constructive dialogues with the Committee, with the assurance that safeguarding the best interests of our children is a shared objective that we will continue to uphold vigorously."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01296,2023-11-06-T-014,1296,Eric Chua,"To the Member's suggestion to develop a national framework for protecting children, the Government already adopts the principles of the child's best interest and welfare in our laws and policies. These are enshrined in our legislation such as the Children and Young Persons Act and the Adoption of Children Act."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01297,2023-11-06-T-014,1297,Eric Chua,"Outside of legislation, the various Ministries set targets and approaches on children-related policies and practices in their respective domains of expertise. For instance, the inter-agency taskforce for Child and Maternal Health and Well-being Strategy and Action Plan reviews and develops approaches to achieve better health outcomes for children. For children with disabilities, the Enabling Masterplan 2030 outlines the Government's priorities to scale up learning support and capacity for preschoolers and students in mainstream schools."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01298,2023-11-06-T-014,1298,Eric Chua,"As for the Member's suggestion to introduce child impact assessments, we engage stakeholders who work closely with children to account for the child's perspective and lived experience and we adopt an outcomes-based approach when developing our policies for children to ensure that they are made in the child's best interest. Over the years, we have found this approach to be effective and sufficient."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01299,2023-11-06-T-014,1299,Eric Chua,"As a parent of a young three-year-old myself, I appreciate and echo the Member's call for the nation to continue to listen to the voices of our young ones on how Singapore can move forward and do things better."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01300,2023-11-06-T-014,1300,Eric Chua,"As the Member noted, the Forward Singapore roadmap recently launched by Deputy Prime Minister Wong is one such example, with numerous consultations held with over 200,000 members of the public over the last 16 months, including youngsters, who voiced their views on issues of concern to them. This is an important part of building a stronger society, and Singapore will continue to engage our children and youth to hear their voices and consider their best interests as we move forward."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01301,2023-11-06-T-014,1301,Eric Chua,"In conclusion, I thank the Member for her commitment to improving children safety and well-being in Singapore. All of us have, indeed, a role to play to create a safer and better environment for our children, and support them to fulfil their hopes and dreams. Singapore has done well. And as a society, we will continue to press on to create a better future for our children and for our nation."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01302,2023-11-06-T-014,1302,Eric Chua,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01303,2023-11-06-T-014,1303,Eric Chua,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."" (proc text)]"
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01304,2023-11-06-T-014,1304,Speaker,"Pursuant to Standing Order 2(3)(a), I wish to inform hon Members that the Sitting tomorrow will commence at 10.30 am. Order, order."
2023-11-06-T-014-S-01305,2023-11-06-T-014,1305,Speaker,Adjourned accordingly at 7.32 pm.
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01306,2023-11-06-T-015,1306,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry is considering reviewing policies and procedures in place at the Singapore Sports School (SSP) to confirm that (i) SSP has all necessary policies and procedures to protect the safety and well-being of all students, (ii) all staff employed by SSP have received comprehensive training on existing policies and procedures and (iii) SSP has mechanisms in place to successfully detect and respond to all breaches of policy or procedure."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01307,2023-11-06-T-015,1307,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Allow me to first recount the facts briefly of what happened to Pranav Madhaik, a young aspiring national athlete from the Singapore Sports School (SSP)."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01308,2023-11-06-T-015,1308,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On 5 October 2023, around 1826 hours, Pranav completed a routine 400-metre fitness time-trial. Time-trials and conditioning sessions are a regular part of a badminton student-athlete’s training."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01309,2023-11-06-T-015,1309,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Pranav had reported to his coach that he felt unwell after the run. The coach then told him to rest. On previous occasions, Pranav had reported being unwell but had recovered after resting."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01310,2023-11-06-T-015,1310,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Pranav rested at the side of the start and end point of the run while the coach attended to administering details of the time-trial. The coach subsequently left the area to brief other student-athletes on competition matters and thereafter dismissed the student-athletes. The coach left the school premises after the briefing, without further checking on Pranav."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01311,2023-11-06-T-015,1311,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"While Pranav was resting, he interacted with two other groups of student-athletes who walked by. A few of them approached him and, according to their accounts, did not notice anything unusual with Pranav at that time. The last group interacted with Pranav at around 1835 hours."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01312,2023-11-06-T-015,1312,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At around 1840 hours, another coach who was walking by noticed Pranav and approached him. Pranav requested for some cold water, and the coach asked a student-athlete to get it for Pranav. Subsequently, after the coach assessed that Pranav appeared to be in some difficulty, he activated the School’s Boarding staff to assist at 1845 hours."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01313,2023-11-06-T-015,1313,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"An ambulance was called at about 1850 hours. It arrived at about 1902 hours and conveyed Pranav to the National University Hospital at about 1919 hours. Pranav was warded and given intensive medical care. Unfortunately, he passed away on 11 October 2023. The cause of death, according to the death certificate, was cardiac arrest with antecedent cause of malformation of coronary vessels."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01314,2023-11-06-T-015,1314,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Throughout Pranav’s hospitalisation, the School continued to provide support for Pranav and his family. School and Ministry of Education (MOE) counsellors, CARE1 officers and school staff also provided emotional support to student-athletes and staff who were emotionally affected."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01315,2023-11-06-T-015,1315,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Following detailed investigations into the incident, the School issued the badminton coach a letter of dismissal on 14 October 2023. This was for his failure to comply with the School’s safety protocol by not accounting for all student-athletes, and checking on their well-being, before dismissing them from training."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01316,2023-11-06-T-015,1316,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and the Singapore Sports School extend our deepest condolences to the family of Pranav Madhaik. Pranav’s unfortunate passing, the loss of a young life with so much potential, has been a sad occasion, and a deep shock to all of us."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01317,2023-11-06-T-015,1317,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The safety and well-being of student-athletes in the Singapore Sports School are paramount matters for the School. All members of the School community – management, staff, coaches, student-athletes themselves, and their parents – play a crucial role in ensuring our student-athletes study and train in a safe environment."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01318,2023-11-06-T-015,1318,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Recognising this, the School has in place comprehensive policies and procedures to protect the safety and well-being of all student-athletes."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01319,2023-11-06-T-015,1319,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The School develops a set of comprehensive policies and procedures, based on the MOE School Safety Handbook. This covers various scenarios that might arise, including student safety, medical emergencies and return to training protocols after injuries or sickness. As with all MOE schools, SSP is subject to an External Safety Validation, which includes checks on safety protocols, processes, equipment, personnel, training, risk assessment and management, simulation exercises and reviews. Such external review and validation has helped SSP take a systematic approach in regularly assessing and enhancing their safety protocols. The school had just undergone an external safety validation in February this year."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01320,2023-11-06-T-015,1320,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, to ensure a culture of compliance with all safety procedures and protocols, the school management conducts checks and collects feedback from student-athletes and parents annually and as appropriate. There is also a whistle-blowing policy for staff to report wrongful practices involving SSP employees. Members of the public can also report any breach of safety policy or procedure by emailing the school directly. All instances of breaches of SSP’s code of conduct are investigated, based on a set framework."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01321,2023-11-06-T-015,1321,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,SSP also equips the school community with the relevant training to ensure student safety.
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01322,2023-11-06-T-015,1322,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"One, all SSP coaches, general managers and boarding staff are first-aid certified, with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of the automated external defibrillator (AED). They are also trained in psychological first aid. SSP coaches are also registered with the National Registry of Coaches, in addition to their specific technical coaching certification."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01323,2023-11-06-T-015,1323,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Two, all student-athletes and staff undergo annual refresher training on emergency preparedness. This includes training on the protocol for the scenario when an individual collapses. There are sufficient AEDs in the school for emergency use. An on-site physiotherapist from the National Youth Sports Institute can also assist to manage and treat injuries and recovery. In Pranav's case, he did not collapse after the run and his symptoms only became more obvious over time. As Pranav was conscious, breathing and had a pulse, the use of an AED was not required."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01324,2023-11-06-T-015,1324,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Three, all sports staff are inducted to the above sports safety Standard Operating Procedures. This includes reviewing the Risk Assessment Management System in their area of work at the beginning of each year."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01325,2023-11-06-T-015,1325,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Four, at the start of each year, all student-athletes are also briefed on sports safety. Coaches also brief student-athletes on safety precautions before the commencement of any new activity."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01326,2023-11-06-T-015,1326,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Notwithstanding the above, following this unfortunate incident, SSP is working together with MCCY on a thorough review of the school’s safety policies and protocols, to identify areas for further improvement. An expert panel is being formed to assist SSP in the review."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01327,2023-11-06-T-015,1327,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The review will seek to further strengthen the school’s safety policies and protocols, including pre-admission screening, communication, implementation and supervision of safety protocols and any other areas recommended by the panel."
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01328,2023-11-06-T-015,1328,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,SSP aims to complete the review by the end of the year but will also progressively implement any improvements when ready.
2023-11-06-T-015-S-01329,2023-11-06-T-015,1329,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MCCY and SSP take this matter seriously. We are strongly committed to the safety of our student-athletes, as we continue to support them in achieving their sporting and academic aspirations. We will also continue to provide the fullest support to the family of Pranav in their time of grief."
2023-11-06-T-016-S-01330,2023-11-06-T-016,1330,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the current regulatory mechanisms to compel social media platforms to expeditiously remove posts or accounts that are suspected of perpetrating scams; (b) what is the average turnaround time for such removals following requests by the authorities; (c) how many of such requests have been made in the last two years; and (d) when will the Online Criminal Harms Act be operationalised.
2023-11-06-T-016-S-01331,2023-11-06-T-016,1331,K Shanmugam,"The Police have been working with social media and e-commerce platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, to take action against online scams. Since 2021, more than 5,900 online monikers and advertisements involved in suspected scams have been flagged out by Police for termination."
2023-11-06-T-016-S-01332,2023-11-06-T-016,1332,K Shanmugam,"The turnaround time varies for each removal, depending on the responsiveness of the platforms. For example, Shopee would usually take about one to two days to respond, while Carousell and Facebook would take longer, sometimes up to five days or even longer. At the end of the spectrum, Telegram has not responded to Police’s requests."
2023-11-06-T-016-S-01333,2023-11-06-T-016,1333,K Shanmugam,"Given the harms that can be caused by scam accounts and posts, it is imperative that they be taken down as fast as possible when flagged. We have been engaging the Internet companies to improve their turnaround time, so that we can reduce the number of people who may fall prey to the scammers."
2023-11-06-T-016-S-01334,2023-11-06-T-016,1334,K Shanmugam,"The Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) was passed in Parliament in July 2023. When OCHA is operationalised progressively from the first quarter of 2024, Police will be able to direct online services to prevent suspected scam accounts or content from interacting with or reaching Singapore users. Non-compliance to these Directions will be an offence."
2023-11-06-T-016-S-01335,2023-11-06-T-016,1335,K Shanmugam,"While OCHA is not yet operationalised, social media services designated under the Broadcasting Act are already required to put in place systems and processes to minimise exposure to harmful content for users in Singapore, including scams. Singapore users are also able to report such content to the social media services for removal under their community guidelines and standards. These requirements are spelt out in the Code of Practice for Online Safety under the Broadcasting Act."
2023-11-06-T-017-S-01336,2023-11-06-T-017,1336,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current percentage of the population that has received a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose; and (b) whether there are plans to integrate COVID-19 vaccination into an annual vaccination regimen, akin to the influenza vaccine."
2023-11-06-T-017-S-01337,2023-11-06-T-017,1337,Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, about 80% of our population have achieved minimum protection of at least three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. For persons aged 60 and above, about half have received an additional dose beyond minimum protection."
2023-11-06-T-017-S-01338,2023-11-06-T-017,1338,Ong Ye Kung,"The protection from vaccines wane over time. As COVID-19 has become an endemic disease, it is more important that seniors and medically vulnerable individuals keep their vaccination up to date, that is, taking a booster around once a year, to reinforce their own protection."
2023-11-06-T-017-S-01339,2023-11-06-T-017,1339,Ong Ye Kung,"As COVID-19 is a relatively new disease, we will continue to study its disease characteristics and vaccination recommendations, before considering it for the national immunisation schedules which are stable long-term recommendations."
2023-11-06-T-018-S-01340,2023-11-06-T-018,1340,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the status of the Ministry's initiatives in infusing greater industry relevance into the academic curriculum; and (b) what are the challenges encountered.
2023-11-06-T-018-S-01341,2023-11-06-T-018,1341,Chan Chun Sing,The Ministry of Education (MOE) regularly reviews the curriculum across all educational levels so that our students are equipped with the necessary competencies to start work.
2023-11-06-T-018-S-01342,2023-11-06-T-018,1342,Chan Chun Sing,"To provide our students with the necessary and foundational skills to navigate the workplace, our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have increased curricular focus on soft skills and core competencies. These include the revised 21st Century Competencies to be developed in schools and the revised LifeSkills curriculum in IHLs. Through enhancements to our harnessing of technology in teaching and learning, our schools and IHLs also aim to equip our students with stronger digital literacy and technological skills."
2023-11-06-T-018-S-01343,2023-11-06-T-018,1343,Chan Chun Sing,"Our schools also work with industry partners to provide real-world experiences, authentic learning and industry exposure for our students. To strengthen these efforts, the new MOE Partnerships Engagement Office has been set up to serve as a central coordinating platform to connect schools with industry and community partners."
2023-11-06-T-018-S-01344,2023-11-06-T-018,1344,Chan Chun Sing,"To ensure industry relevance, the IHLs partner industry to validate their curriculum, and refresh and align their curricula when skills frameworks and industry transformation maps are updated. In addition, components, such as internships and capstone projects with industry, are integrated into IHL programmes to provide students with industry exposure and enable them to apply what they have learnt in the working world."
2023-11-06-T-018-S-01345,2023-11-06-T-018,1345,Chan Chun Sing,"Keeping pace with the fast-changing nature of our economy and business needs is an important priority for the education system. MOE will continue to take proactive steps to ensure our students are prepared for the future of work, by continually refreshing the curriculum to infuse emerging technologies and skills and working closely with industry partners to keep abreast of their latest needs."
2023-11-06-T-019-S-01346,2023-11-06-T-019,1346,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Manpower with reference to the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) to be launched in 2024 (a) what is the current progress of the preparatory work and training to equip companies to implement FWAs; and (b) what are the main challenges or issues that have been surfaced by small and medium enterprises that may prevent them from implementing FWAs.
2023-11-06-T-019-S-01347,2023-11-06-T-019,1347,Tan See Leng,"The Tripartite Workgroup for the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests is currently deliberating the scope of the Guidelines. We are also actively consulting employees, human resource (HR) professionals and employers, including SMEs."
2023-11-06-T-019-S-01348,2023-11-06-T-019,1348,Tan See Leng,"The Workgroup will also make recommendations on how to promote the effective and sustainable provision and utilisation of flexible work arrangements (FWAs). These will build on existing initiatives by the Tripartite Partners, such as workshops run by the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, and the Playbook for Hybrid Workplaces developed by the Institute for Human Resource Professionals."
2023-11-06-T-019-S-01349,2023-11-06-T-019,1349,Tan See Leng,"In our engagements with employers, many have emphasised the importance of recognising the very diverse needs and constraints of different types of businesses, of striking a balance between accommodating employees’ FWA requests and not compromising business operations and outcomes. Some SMEs have also shared that they lack dedicated HR resources and have limited manpower to implement FWAs effectively. The Workgroup will take into account these feedback in designing the Guidelines and consider how best to support employers and HR practitioners, including SMEs."
2023-11-06-T-020-S-01350,2023-11-06-T-020,1350,Ong Hua Han,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many firms have applied for the Job Redesign Grant and Training Grant under the Open Door Programme (ODP) in 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively; (b) what are some specific job redesign projects that the Job Redesign Grant has supported; and (c) whether the Ministry is considering ways to incentivise more firms to utilise ODP."
2023-11-06-T-020-S-01351,2023-11-06-T-020,1351,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SG Enable works closely with interested employers to apply for relevant grants and services under the Open Door Programme (ODP). With this customised approach, all ODP Training Grant and Job Redesign Grant applications made from 2020 to 2022 were successful."
2023-11-06-T-020-S-01352,2023-11-06-T-020,1352,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Between 2020 and 2022, about 90 organisations per year received support from the ODP Training Grant and about 1,650 employees participated in training to be equipped with skills on recruiting and integrating persons with disabilities at their workplace."
2023-11-06-T-020-S-01353,2023-11-06-T-020,1353,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Between 2020 and 2022, 20 employers hiring 60 persons with disabilities benefited from the ODP Job Redesign Grant per year on average. Job redesign initiatives supported by the ODP Job Redesign Grant include installing screen readers that read digital content aloud for employees with visual impairment, providing audio assistive devices for those who are deaf, providing tablets with visual guides for employees with autism spectrum disorder, and installing ramps and converting push doors to sliding doors for wheelchair users."
2023-11-06-T-020-S-01354,2023-11-06-T-020,1354,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Besides the Training Grant and Job Redesign Grant, ODP also supports inclusive hiring through job placement and post-placement job support. These efforts have supported SG Enable and its partners to place 500 persons with disabilities into employment per year, on average, from 2020 to 2022."
2023-11-06-T-020-S-01355,2023-11-06-T-020,1355,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SG Enable proactively engages employers from a wide range of sectors to create job opportunities for persons with disabilities by providing one-to-one advisory and consultancy services on topics, such as inclusive hiring practices, job accommodations and workplace accessibility. In addition, SG Enable works with trade associations and business chambers and networks to reach out to employers on disability-inclusive hiring and support available under ODP. We welcome more employers to tap on support under ODP to start or expand their inclusive hiring efforts."
2023-11-06-T-021-S-01356,2023-11-06-T-021,1356,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the plans under consideration to raise corporate governance standards for listed companies in Singapore; and (b) whether the Government is considering imposing regulatory requirements for companies to meet minimum governance standards, such as attaining minimum Singapore Governance and Transparency Index scores."
2023-11-06-T-021-S-01357,2023-11-06-T-021,1357,Lawrence Wong,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) works closely with the industry to uplift listed companies’ corporate governance standards. Key stakeholders include Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Corporate Governance Advisory Committee (CGAC), an industry-led body set up to advocate good corporate governance practices."
2023-11-06-T-021-S-01358,2023-11-06-T-021,1358,Lawrence Wong,"The SGX Listing Rules and the accompanying Code of Corporate Governance (CG Code) set out the baseline corporate governance standards that all listed companies should adhere to. These include requirements on board composition, director independence and remuneration."
2023-11-06-T-021-S-01359,2023-11-06-T-021,1359,Lawrence Wong,"These minimum requirements are reviewed regularly by MAS and SGX in consultation with CGAC to take into account latest developments and best practices. For instance, in January this year, SGX announced amendments to its Listing Rules to limit the tenure of independent directors serving on boards of listed companies to nine years, and to require listed companies to disclose the exact amount and breakdown of remuneration paid to the CEO and directors."
2023-11-06-T-021-S-01360,2023-11-06-T-021,1360,Lawrence Wong,Mr Louis Chua mentioned the use of the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index (SGTI). In fact the key requirements that go into the SGTI scores are already reflected in the SGX Listing Rules and the CG Code.
2023-11-06-T-021-S-01361,2023-11-06-T-021,1361,Lawrence Wong,"While scorecards are useful for benchmarking practices across entities, they may not fully reflect the quality of disclosures or governance practices. Take for example, the issue of board diversity disclosures. This requires listed companies to describe how the combination of skills, talents, experience and diversity of its directors serves the needs and plans of the listed company. These are important qualitative assessments that need to be made in the context of the operating environment of the company. They are not easily reduced to a simple score."
2023-11-06-T-022-S-01362,2023-11-06-T-022,1362,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the step-by-step actions taken to help students who have (i) suicide ideations and (ii) attempted suicide respectively; (b) what is the process for escalating severe cases; and (c) what are the actions taken to continuously monitor such cases.
2023-11-06-T-022-S-01363,2023-11-06-T-022,1363,Chan Chun Sing,Schools have established processes to help students at risk of self-harm or suicide. Teachers are trained to identify students experiencing distress and to provide timely support and guidance. Dedicated time has been set aside for teachers to check in regularly on their students’ well-being. Schools also have a system of peer support to enable students to highlight distressed peers to teachers. Students struggling with socio-emotional or mental health issues are referred to the School Counsellor.
2023-11-06-T-022-S-01364,2023-11-06-T-022,1364,Chan Chun Sing,"School Counsellors are trained to conduct a suicide risk assessment and to bring in parental and other support for the students' safety. They will address possible underlying issues and guide the students to develop effective coping strategies. Students with suicide risk will be referred urgently to the Response, Early intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health (REACH) teams or emergency services in hospitals for further intervention."
2023-11-06-T-022-S-01365,2023-11-06-T-022,1365,Chan Chun Sing,"Schools monitor these students closely and work directly with parents and caregivers to keep track of their mental health state, assess potential risks and adjust support as needed. Together with the healthcare institutions, schools work with parents to ensure there is adequate safety and support, including to help students access further mental health support when needed."
2023-11-06-T-023-S-01366,2023-11-06-T-023,1366,Poh Li San,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to Insanet’s advanced spyware which can be installed on computers and mobile devices via advertisements and had been legally authorised by the Israeli government for sale, what measures are put in place to protect our users, especially in relation to banking and financial transactions."
2023-11-06-T-023-S-01367,2023-11-06-T-023,1367,Josephine Teo,"Insanet’s advanced spyware product, named “Sherlock”, is yet another development in the fast-evolving cyber threat landscape. Such products are not new. Spyware is a type of sophisticated malware which is used to target specific high-value individuals and is designed to secretly obtain sensitive information and monitor someone’s activities. According to media reports, Sherlock can infect a mobile device if it was used simply to view an ""infected"" online advertisement. The same reports also say that the sale of Sherlock is subject to tight restrictions, including approval from the Israeli government. It is also an expensive spyware that has a multi-million-dollar price tag and requires a significant amount of resources, advanced planning and trained personnel to target its victim successfully."
2023-11-06-T-023-S-01368,2023-11-06-T-023,1368,Josephine Teo,There have been no reported cases of Sherlock infections in Singapore. This will not be the last time we hear of sophisticated spyware being developed. Our security agencies will continue to guard against such threats.
2023-11-06-T-023-S-01369,2023-11-06-T-023,1369,Josephine Teo,"Spyware is different from the malware-enabled scams we see in Singapore. Malware-enabled scams target banking and financial transactions and typically trick users to download and install a malicious app. At the individual level, we must continue to stay vigilant and practise good cyber hygiene, such as avoiding untrustworthy websites and unknown apps, updating software promptly, and using anti-virus software and security apps. Such cyber hygiene practices will go a long way in protecting ourselves."
2023-11-06-T-024-S-01370,2023-11-06-T-024,1370,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) how serious is the issue of elderly patients affected by delirium in Singapore; (b) what is the annual number of such patients as broken down by the severity and duration of their condition; (c) what are the treatment options available; and (c) whether the progression of delirium can be slowed down or treated completely.
2023-11-06-T-024-S-01371,2023-11-06-T-024,1371,Ong Ye Kung,"Delirium refers to an acute and sudden change in brain function that causes a person to appear confused or disoriented or to have difficulties maintaining focus and thinking clearly, typically with a fluctuating time-limited course. This is unlike dementia where the onset is generally slow, chronic and progresses over years."
2023-11-06-T-024-S-01372,2023-11-06-T-024,1372,Ong Ye Kung,"Delirium can be the result of many different causes, including medical conditions, infection, recent surgery and certain medications. The Ministry of Health does not track the number of patients with delirium. Studies show that delirium occurs in about 10% to 30% of elderly patients admitted to hospital for acute medical problems."
2023-11-06-T-024-S-01373,2023-11-06-T-024,1373,Ong Ye Kung,"The key measures to manage delirium are to treat the underlying medical illness that may be causing it and to address factors known to aggravate delirium, such as pain, dehydration and certain medications."
2023-11-06-T-024-S-01374,2023-11-06-T-024,1374,Ong Ye Kung,Patients with delirium generally improve and recover when the underlying cause of delirium has been treated.
2023-11-06-T-025-S-01375,2023-11-06-T-025,1375,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for National Development in view of the proposed rezoning from ""park"" to ""road"" at Sungei Serangoon for the construction of a bus depot (a) whether any environmental impact assessment has been carried out or whether any studies have been undertaken on the environmental impact of the construction of the road and bus depot; (b) if so, whether such assessment or studies can be disclosed to the public; and (c) what measures have been or will be taken to mitigate any negative environmental impact."
2023-11-06-T-025-S-01376,2023-11-06-T-025,1376,Desmond Lee,"As part of our planning process, environmental studies are required for developments which may potentially cause significant environmental impact."
2023-11-06-T-025-S-01377,2023-11-06-T-025,1377,Desmond Lee,"As the bus depot at Sungei Serangoon will be constructed on a brownfield site comprising primarily young regrowth scrubland, the potential impact on sensitive habitats was assessed to be limited and an environmental study was, therefore, not required. To mitigate any environmental impact, the Land Transport Authority will put in place measures, such as earth control measures and restricted working hours, during the construction of the bus depot."
2023-11-06-T-026-S-01378,2023-11-06-T-026,1378,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry is considering reviewing the training provided to full-time National Servicemen (NSF) in the SPF and SCDF to confirm that all these NSFs understand their rights and responsibilities with respect to recognising and challenging workplace practice that may be inconsistent with existing policies, procedures or doctrines."
2023-11-06-T-026-S-01379,2023-11-06-T-026,1379,K Shanmugam,"All Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) undergo basic training conducted by the Police Training Command or Civil Defence Academy before they are deployed for operational duties. During basic training, NSFs are taught their Home Team Department’s core values and code of conduct, which include the need to report practices that breach existing policies, procedures or doctrines."
2023-11-06-T-026-S-01380,2023-11-06-T-026,1380,K Shanmugam,"NSFs and officers can confidentially report wrongful workplace practices through reporting channels which have been well-established in SPF and SCDF. They can raise issues related to breaches of policies, malpractice or wrongdoing in the workplace to their direct supervisor, Unit Commander or Director and even the senior leadership of their Home Team Department and the Ministry headquarters. This can be done in writing or in person. All reports are looked into objectively and expeditiously."
2023-11-06-T-026-S-01381,2023-11-06-T-026,1381,K Shanmugam,"The NSFs and officers are informed of the reporting channels when they first join their Home Team Department, during their basic training. They are reminded during subsequent in-service training programmes and some dialogues and forums with management, as well as through periodic internal communications."
2023-11-06-T-027-S-01382,2023-11-06-T-027,1382,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the likelihood of a surge in dengue cases in the coming months; and (b) whether the Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Health to ensure sufficient hospital bed capacity for severe dengue cases.
2023-11-06-T-027-S-01383,2023-11-06-T-027,1383,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The current number of dengue cases remains high and the risk of a surge of cases persists. This is because the expected warmer than usual year-end weather due to the current El Nino phenomenon and wetter conditions in the coming weeks may create more favourable conditions for mosquito breeding and dengue transmission.
2023-11-06-T-027-S-01384,2023-11-06-T-027,1384,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Environment Agency works closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other Government agencies through the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to monitor and manage the dengue situation. While most dengue cases can be managed by general practitioners and polyclinics, MOH ensures that hospitals have adequate capacity to provide timely medical care for dengue patients who need it, including severe cases which require hospitalisation."
2023-11-06-T-027-S-01385,2023-11-06-T-027,1385,Grace Fu Hai Yien,I urge members of the public and all other stakeholders to take immediate actions to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats and avoid mosquito bites in order to prevent a surge of dengue cases in the coming months.
2023-11-06-T-028-S-01386,2023-11-06-T-028,1386,Usha Chandradas,asked the Minister for Communications and Information what is the extent of Government support available for ground-up community libraries that encourage reading in Singapore.
2023-11-06-T-028-S-01387,2023-11-06-T-028,1387,Josephine Teo,"In addition to offering reading and learning resources through its network of 28 libraries, the National Library Board (NLB) works with partners and the community to ensure that Singaporeans have convenient access to reading materials. This includes donating older library books in good condition to community-run spaces as their seed collections. Doing so supports NLB’s focus on sustainability, as these books are given a new lease of life."
2023-11-06-T-028-S-01388,2023-11-06-T-028,1388,Josephine Teo,"Since April 2020, NLB has provided more than 48,000 such books to 102 organisations, including Residents’ Committees (RCs), Community Centres (CCs), Senior Activity Centres, schools and private organisations."
2023-11-06-T-028-S-01389,2023-11-06-T-028,1389,Josephine Teo,"Communities also seek NLB’s advice when they are looking to run initiatives that promote reading and learning, such as the setting up of reading corners. NLB shares its experience in operating public libraries, especially on the importance of educating users that libraries are shared spaces providing shared resources and should be used responsibly."
2023-11-06-T-028-S-01390,2023-11-06-T-028,1390,Josephine Teo,"In addition, the People’s Association (PA) actively supports programmes initiated and run by residents and communities to promote reading. This includes the provision of its premises, support for publicity, donation drives, as well as funding under the PA’s Community Volunteer Enabling Grant (CV-EG)."
2023-11-06-T-028-S-01391,2023-11-06-T-028,1391,Josephine Teo,"NLB will continue to work with partners, including PA and the community, to promote the habit and joy of reading, lifelong learning and discovery."
2023-11-06-T-029-S-01392,2023-11-06-T-029,1392,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Education how does the Ministry currently monitor the learning and industry relevance outcomes of Continuing Education and Training programmes.
2023-11-06-T-029-S-01393,2023-11-06-T-029,1393,Chan Chun Sing,The Ministry of Education (MOE) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) adopt a variety of methods to measure and monitor the outcomes of SkillsFuture-funded Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes.
2023-11-06-T-029-S-01394,2023-11-06-T-029,1394,Chan Chun Sing,"Wage and employment outcomes are the most concrete and quantifiable way to measure the learning and industry relevance of skills training. We work with partners, such as the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), to monitor these outcomes through programme-specific surveys and econometric studies. For example, the annual Work-Study Programme Outcomes Survey (WSPOS) has consistently showed that more than 90% of the trainees were employed within six months of completing the programme. Their median salaries were also higher than what they received at the start of the programme. A 2018 study conducted by MTI also showed positive effects of the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training on employment and wages."
2023-11-06-T-029-S-01395,2023-11-06-T-029,1395,Chan Chun Sing,"However, wage and employment outcomes do not always tell us the full picture. Reskilling may have helped workers, who were otherwise at risk of displacement, keep their jobs or take on new job roles. As such, MOE and SSG take a broader view of the impact of the SkillsFuture movement, including through monitoring whether workers find that training helps them to be more effective at their jobs. The Training Quality and Outcomes Measures (TRAQOM) survey, administered by SkillsFuture Singapore on courses that it funds, found that more than nine in 10 trainees said that they saw an improvement in work performance and were able to take on enhanced responsibilities at work."
2023-11-06-T-030-S-01396,2023-11-06-T-030,1396,Mariam Jaafar,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how many seniors eligible to receive the Assurance Package Seniors' Bonus have not received the payout; and (b) what is being done to ensure that such seniors receive this payout.
2023-11-06-T-030-S-01397,2023-11-06-T-030,1397,Lawrence Wong,"All eligible seniors, numbering over 800,000, have received the Assurance Package Seniors’ Bonus and the 2023 Cost-of-Living Seniors’ Bonus in February 2023 and June 2023 respectively."
2023-11-06-T-030-S-01398,2023-11-06-T-030,1398,Lawrence Wong,"Seniors who have not received the Seniors’ Bonus are those who are ineligible due to not meeting one of the criteria, like Assessable Income or owning multiple properties."
2023-11-06-T-030-S-01399,2023-11-06-T-030,1399,Lawrence Wong,"If Ms Mariam knows of residents whose information may not have been updated, please bring them to the attention of the Ministry of Finance."
2023-11-06-T-031-S-01400,2023-11-06-T-031,1400,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Health what are the actions taken by the Institute of Mental Health when a patient fails to attend appointments repeatedly.
2023-11-06-T-031-S-01401,2023-11-06-T-031,1401,Ong Ye Kung,"Patients who fail to attend their appointments will be checked on and followed up with phone calls. Higher-risk patients will be assigned designated case managers to closely monitor their appointment and treatment adherence. If required, IMH staff will perform a home visit."
2023-11-06-T-031-S-01402,2023-11-06-T-031,1402,Ong Ye Kung,Patients who are required by law to undergo treatment at IMH may be admitted mandatorily for inpatient management if they default on their appointments and fail to adhere to the outpatient treatment plan.
2023-11-06-T-032-S-01403,2023-11-06-T-032,1403,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB has made a study on the amount of heat emission from top floors of multi-storey car parks (MSCPs) that have parking lots; (b) whether gardens located atop such MSCPs emit less heat; and (c) what are the practical limitations that inhibit the conversion of MSCPs with underutilised upper decks into garden spaces.
2023-11-06-T-032-S-01404,2023-11-06-T-032,1404,Desmond Lee,"HDB multi-storey car park (MSCP) rooftops are meant to provide unsheltered parking spaces. As part of greenery intensification efforts under the Green Towns Programme, MSCP rooftops that are not heavily used for parking are converted to extensive greenery and community or allotment gardens via the installation of the Prefabricated Extensive Green Roof Tray System, if found suitable. Studies by HDB have shown that this system can potentially mitigate heat gain by reducing surface temperature by an average of four degrees Celsius, as compared to a bare concrete surface."
2023-11-06-T-032-S-01405,2023-11-06-T-032,1405,Desmond Lee,"Not all HDB MSCP rooftops, even if not required for parking, are suitable for conversion to greenery or gardens. The feasibility of conversion depends on considerations, including structural load, the availability of electricity and water supply, potential disamenities to residents, whether retrofitting can meet fire safety standards and development plans for the area."
2023-11-06-T-032-S-01406,2023-11-06-T-032,1406,Desmond Lee,"Besides greenery or gardens, MSCP rooftops could potentially be put to other uses that benefit the community. We will continue to study approaches to make good use of our HDB MSCP rooftops."
2023-11-06-T-033-S-01407,2023-11-06-T-033,1407,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Education in light of the recent queer-themed performance at a local university which it later said should not have been held publicly, whether the Ministry will consider setting guidelines on public performances held in our autonomous universities to ensure that they reflect the widely accepted social norms and practices in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-033-S-01408,2023-11-06-T-033,1408,Chan Chun Sing,"As Institutes of Higher Learning, our autonomous universities (AUs) are common spaces and should provide neutral ground for learning, open discussions and civil discourse. In carrying out their activities, they must be respectful of Singapore's wider social norms and exercise appropriate judgement and sensitivity when dealing with issues that may potentially be socially divisive. Within the bounds of these principles, as well as national guidelines and laws, the AUs have the autonomy to manage campus activities, including public performances."
2023-11-06-T-034-S-01409,2023-11-06-T-034,1409,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the current measures to prevent unauthorised arms sales and transfers from taking place through Singapore; and (b) what steps are being taken to review and improve such efforts.
2023-11-06-T-034-S-01410,2023-11-06-T-034,1410,Gan Kim Yong,Singapore adopts a comprehensive approach to prevent and deter unauthorised arms sales and transfers from taking place through Singapore.
2023-11-06-T-034-S-01411,2023-11-06-T-034,1411,Gan Kim Yong,"Firstly, the Strategic Goods (Control) Act 2002 (SGCA) regulates the export, transshipment, transit, intangible transfer of technology and brokering of strategic goods and strategic goods technology. Any person or entity engaged in activities involving strategic goods or strategic goods technology must abide by the permit and registration requirements under SGCA. These include applying for a permit prior to the export, transshipment and transit of strategic goods and/or intangible transfer of technology listed in the Strategic Goods Control List, as well as for goods or technology which are intended or likely to be used for weapons of mass destruction purposes. In addition, persons who import, export or transship arms through Singapore must apply for a licence from the Singapore Police Force under the Arms and Explosives Act and must be assessed to be a ""fit and proper"" person as part of the licensing criteria."
2023-11-06-T-034-S-01412,2023-11-06-T-034,1412,Gan Kim Yong,"Secondly, the Inter-Ministry Committee on Export Controls coordinates across various Government agencies to ensure that Singapore complies strictly with our international obligations on international arms sales and transfers, as well as the United Nations' sanctions and embargoes against any country."
2023-11-06-T-034-S-01413,2023-11-06-T-034,1413,Gan Kim Yong,"Thirdly, the relevant agencies raise awareness through advisories and regular outreach programmes to ensure that Singapore-based businesses and shipping companies are aware of the latest regulatory requirements which they must comply with."
2023-11-06-T-035-S-01414,2023-11-06-T-035,1414,Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Manpower whether CPF Board will give CPF members the option to take their CPF accounts offline to further safeguard themselves against loss through scams and malware fraud.
2023-11-06-T-035-S-01415,2023-11-06-T-035,1415,Tan See Leng,"Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) is actively working with other Government agencies and banks to safeguard members’ CPF savings from scams. CPFB and GovTech introduced Singpass Face Verification as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF e-services in June 2023. In addition, CPF withdrawals are only paid into bank accounts after banks have verified that the bank account belongs to the member."
2023-11-06-T-035-S-01416,2023-11-06-T-035,1416,Tan See Leng,"We are mindful that the nature of scams is constantly evolving and are committed to strengthening our safeguards. Hence, CPFB is developing an additional suite of measures to protect CPF members’ savings, which include options to limit or disable online withdrawals. We will provide more details in due course."
2023-11-06-T-036-S-01417,2023-11-06-T-036,1417,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) over the past 10 years, how many cases of feedback has LTA received annually regarding the overcharging of bus fares due to errors involving card readers on buses; and (b) what steps has LTA taken to resolve such issues."
2023-11-06-T-036-S-01418,2023-11-06-T-036,1418,Chee Hong Tat,"Bus operators are required to maintain bus equipment regularly, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) audits their maintenance regimes twice a year. Operationally, bus captains are trained to check that the bus stops are accurately reflected on the card reader and to surface any discrepancies. LTA also tracks commuters’ claims for over-deduction and works with bus operators to investigate buses with higher frequencies of claims."
2023-11-06-T-036-S-01419,2023-11-06-T-036,1419,Chee Hong Tat,These measures have been strengthened over the years and have proven to be effective; 0.0005% of all bus trips had over-deduction claims in 2014. This has halved to 0.0002% in 2022.
2023-11-06-T-037-S-01420,2023-11-06-T-037,1420,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information in light of the data centre outage on 14 October 2023 affecting banks, telcos and social media platforms (a) whether there are plans to regulate big technology companies to ensure adherence to service standards, given that such outages affect many people and may have a real economic impact; and (b) what are the Ministry’s efforts for Singapore’s overall national security to minimise a concentration of risks from the usage of a few data centres by the public and private sectors."
2023-11-06-T-037-S-01421,2023-11-06-T-037,1421,Josephine Teo,"The specifics of the recent outage affecting banking services have been, or will be, addressed in response to related Parliamentary Questions. I will focus on the broader digital infrastructure landscape and the Government’s approach to enhancing its security and resilience."
2023-11-06-T-037-S-01422,2023-11-06-T-037,1422,Josephine Teo,"Where a data centre supports the delivery of essential services or other nationally important systems, we have regulation in place to ensure its security and resilience. For example, the Cyber Security Agency identifies and regulates Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), which can include computer systems situated in a data centre, that are necessary for the provision of essential services in sectors, such as the Government, infocomm, and banking and finance. In addition, sector regulators impose requirements on the service providers in their sectors. Major telcos and banks, for instance, are regulated by the Infocomm Media Development Authority and Monetary Authority of Singapore respectively, for security and resilience. Exercises and audits are conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of service providers’ security and resilience measures."
2023-11-06-T-037-S-01423,2023-11-06-T-037,1423,Josephine Teo,"With more of our economic activity moving online and the growing interconnectedness of our systems, the Government recognises the need to further study our reliance on different components of digital infrastructure, the risks and impact of disruptions, and the need for more interventions. For example, data centres may not all host CII systems but collectively provide foundational services for the proper functioning of our economy. Today, most data centre operators already adopt a risk management approach in line with international standards, including the implementation of measures to ensure resilience. The Government is studying whether and how best to strengthen the security and resilience of data centres as a category of digital infrastructure with significant impact. This may include risk-calibrated regulation for data centres, taking reference from international standards and best practices."
2023-11-06-T-037-S-01424,2023-11-06-T-037,1424,Josephine Teo,"However, we must recognise that regulation alone will not fully eliminate the possibility of outages and disruptions. Industries and enterprises must also play their part. To ensure consumer confidence, entities, such as banks, telcos and digital service providers should take steps to mitigate risks and ensure the continued delivery of important digital services even when outages or disruptions occur."
2023-11-06-T-038-S-01425,2023-11-06-T-038,1425,Ong Hua Han,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each year from 2020 to 2022, how many wrongful dismissal complaints have been filed with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management against firms with fewer than 25 employees; and (b) how many of such firms have received more than one complaint against them for this three-year period."
2023-11-06-T-038-S-01426,2023-11-06-T-038,1426,Tan See Leng,"Between 2020 and 2022, an average of around 380 wrongful dismissal claims were filed with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) each year from employees working in firms with fewer than 25 employees."
2023-11-06-T-038-S-01427,2023-11-06-T-038,1427,Tan See Leng,"Out of the firms involved in wrongful dismissal claims who employed fewer than 25 employees during the three-year period, about 6% of them had more than one claim filed against them. Employees who feel that they have been wrongfully dismissed can approach TADM for help, regardless of the workforce size of the firm."
2023-11-06-T-039-S-01428,2023-11-06-T-039,1428,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the BCA Academy provides instalment plans for Singaporeans who wish to undertake skills upgrading courses offered by the Academy but have financial challenges in raising the course fees at one go; and (b) if it does not, whether the Academy will consider allowing such Singaporeans to pay by instalments instead of expecting them to raise the full fees before enrolling in their courses."
2023-11-06-T-039-S-01429,2023-11-06-T-039,1429,Desmond Lee,"As part of our Built Environment (BE) sector transformation efforts, we want to encourage our workforce to continually upgrade their skills. That is why the BCA Academy (BCAA) offers a wide range of programmes targeted at all segments of the Built Environment workforce – from professionals to technicians and construction personnel."
2023-11-06-T-039-S-01430,2023-11-06-T-039,1430,Desmond Lee,"To ensure that its courses remain affordable and accessible, BCAA adopts a cost recovery pricing approach. This means that the fees are set based on the course duration and resources involved in organising and delivering the course. For instance, the Site Management of Precast Concrete Construction course costs $550. This is a 10-hour course that equips construction managers with the knowledge to plan and manage precast concrete construction site activities effectively. BCAA also offers longer courses, like the Specialist Diploma in Computational Building Information Modelling (BIM). Each module of the Specialist Diploma costs $3,500 and runs for three months. The course is designed for professionals in the Built Environment sector who are keen to use computational methods for building projects. Overall, the median fee for courses targeted at technicians and construction personnel is $750, while the median fee for professionals is $1,850."
2023-11-06-T-039-S-01431,2023-11-06-T-039,1431,Desmond Lee,"In addition, the Government offers generous funding support for Singaporeans in their upskilling journey. Singaporeans may receive funding support of up to 70% of course fees for approved courses, including those offered by BCAA. To illustrate, this means that a Singaporean only needs to pay $300 to take up an approved course that costs $1,000, excluding GST. Singaporeans can also use their SkillsFuture Credit to pay for the remaining course fees, further lowering the upfront payment they need to make. The Government also encourages employers to do their part in upskilling their employees by providing training subsidies and absentee payroll funding for approved courses."
2023-11-06-T-039-S-01432,2023-11-06-T-039,1432,Desmond Lee,"Taken together, the vast majority of Singaporeans do not have difficulty in paying for BCAA’s courses. We receive very few appeals for additional financial support. This year, only five out of the over 16,000 course applicants submitted appeals to BCAA. We look at each case carefully and our general approach is to encourage the appellant to explore the various support schemes available, including linking them up with relevant community self-help groups."
2023-11-06-T-039-S-01433,2023-11-06-T-039,1433,Desmond Lee,"Even so, we understand that some applicants may not wish to pay for the full course fees upfront. As such, instead of offering instalment plans, BCAA has been reviewing and repackaging its longer courses into bite-sized learning modules to make them more affordable and accessible. Under such a system, instead of paying for the entire course upfront, students only need to pay fees for each module as they progress. BCAA is also considering this “pay as you learn” approach for more of its shorter courses. On top of reducing the upfront payment for participants, this gives them flexibility to decide whether to complete the full course or just selected modules."
2023-11-06-T-040-S-01434,2023-11-06-T-040,1434,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry is considering reviewing policies and procedures in place at Singapore Changi Airport to confirm that (i) the airport has all the necessary policies and procedures to identify passengers transiting through the terminal who may pose as an on-board risk and (ii) all security officers at the airport have received training in identifying and responding to members of the public who may be experiencing mental health issues.
2023-11-06-T-040-S-01435,2023-11-06-T-040,1435,K Shanmugam,"Our security agencies conduct regular patrols of Changi Airport, including the transit area. The airport’s security officers and other frontline staff, such as check-in agents, cleaners, trolley retrievers and retail staff, are also trained to look out for persons exhibiting suspicious or irregular behaviours that could be of security concern, including due to mental health issues."
2023-11-06-T-040-S-01436,2023-11-06-T-040,1436,K Shanmugam,"Airlines also conduct their own assessment of passengers. Those identified as an on-board risk, for example, where they may harm themselves or others, will be refused boarding by the airline."
2023-11-06-T-040-S-01437,2023-11-06-T-040,1437,K Shanmugam,Suspicious individuals and those identified as an on-board risk will be reported to the security agencies for further checks. Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure everyone’s safety.
2023-11-06-T-041-S-01438,2023-11-06-T-041,1438,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Education how is the Ministry addressing the creation and implementation of a new curriculum for educational institutions to keep pace with the rapidly evolving needs and transformations within industries.
2023-11-06-T-041-S-01439,2023-11-06-T-041,1439,Chan Chun Sing,The Ministry of Education (MOE) regularly reviews the curriculum across all educational levels so that our students are equipped with the necessary competencies to start work.
2023-11-06-T-041-S-01440,2023-11-06-T-041,1440,Chan Chun Sing,"To provide our students with the necessary and foundational skills to navigate the workplace, our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have increased curricular focus on soft skills and core competencies. These include the revised 21st Century Competencies to be developed in schools and the revised LifeSkills curriculum in the IHLs. Through enhancements to our harnessing of technology in teaching and learning, our schools and IHLs also aim to equip our students with stronger digital literacy and technological skills."
2023-11-06-T-041-S-01441,2023-11-06-T-041,1441,Chan Chun Sing,"Our schools also work with industry partners to provide real-world experiences, authentic learning and industry exposure for our students. To strengthen these efforts, the new MOE Partnerships Engagement Office has been set up to serve as a central coordinating platform to connect schools with industry and community partners."
2023-11-06-T-041-S-01442,2023-11-06-T-041,1442,Chan Chun Sing,"To ensure industry relevance, the IHLs partner industry to validate their curriculum and refresh and align their curricula when skills frameworks and industry transformation maps are updated. In addition, components, such as internships and capstone projects with industry, are integrated into IHL programmes to provide students with industry exposure and enable them to apply what they have learnt in the working world."
2023-11-06-T-041-S-01443,2023-11-06-T-041,1443,Chan Chun Sing,Keeping pace with the fast-changing nature of our economy and business needs is an important priority for the education system. MOE will continue to take proactive steps to ensure our students are prepared for the future of work by continually refreshing the curriculum to infuse emerging technologies and skills and working closely with industry partners to keep abreast of their latest needs.
2023-11-06-T-042-S-01444,2023-11-06-T-042,1444,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry has received information of designated social media services which allow advertisements to be used as tools for scams or to promote violence, which can be accessed from their respective platforms by Singapore-based residents; and (b) if so, what enforcement action is contemplated against these services."
2023-11-06-T-042-S-01445,2023-11-06-T-042,1445,Josephine Teo,"Under the Broadcasting Act (BA), the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has designated six Social Media Services (SMSs) with significant reach or impact in Singapore. They are Facebook, HardwareZone, Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube. These SMSs are required to comply with the Code of Practice for Online Safety, which took effect on 18 July 2023. They must put in place systems and processes to minimise exposure to harmful content for users in Singapore, including scams and violent content. Singapore users are also able to report such content to the SMSs for removal under their community guidelines and standards."
2023-11-06-T-042-S-01446,2023-11-06-T-042,1446,Josephine Teo,"BA also provides IMDA with the powers to issue Directions to disable access by Singapore users to egregious content found on SMSs, including content advocating or instructing violence. So far, IMDA has not received information concerning advertisements used to promote violence on any SMS."
2023-11-06-T-042-S-01447,2023-11-06-T-042,1447,Josephine Teo,"As for scams, the Police received more than 2,000 reports concerning online advertisements being used as tools for scams between 18 July and September 2023. The majority involved postings on Facebook. Concerning these reports, the Police have worked closely with the SMSs to remove these advertisements."
2023-11-06-T-042-S-01448,2023-11-06-T-042,1448,Josephine Teo,"Once the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) is brought into force next year, the Ministry of Home Affairs will also have the powers to deal with online content which facilitates or abets crime, such as scams. Designated officers, including from the Police, will be able to issue Directions to online service providers, which could include SMSs, to disable access by Singapore users to specified criminal content found on their services. Such criminal content could include advertisements which are believed to be carried out for scams. This will be more effective than depending on user reports to SMSs, as non-compliance to these Directions will be an offence. The Competent Authority can issue Orders to restrict access to the online services that are non-compliant with these Directions, to prevent the criminal activity and content from being accessed by persons in Singapore. Furthermore, OCHA will also empower the Government to require designated online services, including SMSs, to put in place systems, processes and measures to proactively disrupt scams and malicious cyber activities affecting people in Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-043-S-01449,2023-11-06-T-043,1449,Poh Li San,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can provide an update on its engagement with Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners on how they can be part of the community involved in the Healthier SG initiative.
2023-11-06-T-043-S-01450,2023-11-06-T-043,1450,Ong Ye Kung,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), being holistic by nature, can play an important role in preventive health."
2023-11-06-T-043-S-01451,2023-11-06-T-043,1451,Ong Ye Kung,"To this end, we have been discussing with members of the TCM Practitioners (TCMP) Board as well as the wider TCMP community on how TCMPs may better support Healthier SG. This will involve strengthening its self-regulatory regime, and qualifying certain TCM clinics or practitioners, to participate in Healthier SG and deliver lifestyle or social prescriptions. The Ministry of Health will announce details when they are ready."
2023-11-06-T-044-S-01452,2023-11-06-T-044,1452,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there have been any cases of suspected money laundering detected and investigated since the integrated resorts commenced their businesses; (b) if so, how many cases have been reported to the Casino Regulatory Authority; and (c) what are the additional measures taken to detect and prevent money laundering at the integrated resorts."
2023-11-06-T-044-S-01453,2023-11-06-T-044,1453,K Shanmugam,"Since the Integrated Resorts started operations in 2010, the Police have  detected 11 individuals who used criminal proceeds in the casinos. All 11 individuals"
2023-11-06-T-044-S-01454,2023-11-06-T-044,1454,K Shanmugam,All of these cases were reported to and investigated by the Police. The Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has not directly received reported cases of money laundering.
2023-11-06-T-044-S-01455,2023-11-06-T-044,1455,K Shanmugam,"There is a framework to prevent money laundering in the casinos. GRA requires the casino operators to put safeguards in place, such as conducting customer due diligence checks and periodic monitoring of patrons’ transactions."
2023-11-06-T-044-S-01456,2023-11-06-T-044,1456,K Shanmugam,"GRA conducts regular inspections of the casino operators. Where non-compliance is detected, GRA will require the casino operators to implement rectification measures. GRA will also take regulatory action against the casino operator, such as imposing financial penalties, where merited."
2023-11-06-T-044-S-01457,2023-11-06-T-044,1457,K Shanmugam,"We also have tough penalties to deter money laundering. The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA) criminalises the laundering of benefits derived from drug dealing and other criminal conduct. Individuals convicted of money laundering offences are liable to a fine of up to S$500,000 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years. In May this year, we enhanced CDSA by introducing new offences to allow the Police to act more effectively against money laundering."
2023-11-06-T-045-S-01458,2023-11-06-T-045,1458,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment for each of the past five years, how many cases have been reported where catered food for migrant workers living in dormitories is provided without a time-stamp indicating the date and time by which the food should be consumed."
2023-11-06-T-045-S-01459,2023-11-06-T-045,1459,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the past five years, the Singapore Food Agency has not received any reported cases of catered food for migrant workers living in dormitories being provided without a “consume by” time-stamp."
2023-11-06-T-046-S-01460,2023-11-06-T-046,1460,See Jinli Jean,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the plans to ensure that companies with artificial intelligence (AI) driven business models, such as platform companies, are enrolled into IMDA's AI Verify Foundation that seeks to uphold responsible and ethical use of AI; and (b) whether the Government will consider (i) a reporting channel for consumers who are subjected to companies’ irresponsible use of AI and (ii) a tripartism approach to shaping rules in using AI for work and workforce management."
2023-11-06-T-046-S-01461,2023-11-06-T-046,1461,Josephine Teo,Singapore supports the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) across all settings.
2023-11-06-T-046-S-01462,2023-11-06-T-046,1462,Josephine Teo,"Though there is broad agreement that processes and outcomes should be explainable, transparent, fair and human-centric, technical standards for responsible AI are still in the nascent stage of development. Nevertheless, to promote responsible AI use, IMDA has introduced guidelines and tools for owners and developers of AI systems. These include (a) the Model AI Governance Framework in 2019; and (b) AI Verify in 2022 – a voluntary testing framework and software toolkit that helps companies (i) objectively validate the performance of their AI systems against responsible AI principles, and (ii) demonstrate this to their stakeholders through the sharing of testing reports."
2023-11-06-T-046-S-01463,2023-11-06-T-046,1463,Josephine Teo,"AI Verify can, therefore, be a useful basis for unions to engage employers or labour market intermediaries on the use of AI that impact workers. In fact, early adopters of AI Verify include online human resource services platform XOPA.ai."
2023-11-06-T-046-S-01464,2023-11-06-T-046,1464,Josephine Teo,"As for reporting channels, this would depend on the specific concerns. For example, reports concerning employment discrimination as a result of AI use should continue to be channelled to the Ministry of Manpower or the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) for assessment and follow up. For insurance- or banking-related concerns, reports can be directed to the Monetary Authority of Singapore."
2023-11-06-T-047-S-01465,2023-11-06-T-047,1465,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs what avenues are available to Singaporeans who wish to report on foreigners whom they believe to have committed actions that constitute interference in Singapore’s domestic politics and participating in Singapore’s domestic affairs.
2023-11-06-T-047-S-01466,2023-11-06-T-047,1466,K Shanmugam,They can contact the Police.
2023-11-06-T-048-S-01467,2023-11-06-T-048,1467,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry works with the Land Transport Authority on planning for the transport of migrant workers at dormitories; and (b) whether it regulates dormitory operators on monitoring of shuttle transport waiting times and adequacy.
2023-11-06-T-048-S-01468,2023-11-06-T-048,1468,Tan See Leng,"Dormitory operators are only required by the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA) to ensure that migrant workers have access to adequate dedicated transport to their workplaces if they do not walk, cycle or have transport provided by their employers. For non-work travels, migrant workers would usually use public transport. While not required under FEDA, some larger dormitory operators may also supplement this with shuttle services to public transport nodes on their own accord."
2023-11-06-T-048-S-01469,2023-11-06-T-048,1469,Tan See Leng,"The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not require such dormitory operators to monitor the waiting times of their shuttle services provided on a voluntary basis, but if there are areas not sufficiently served by existing transport services, dormitory residents are advised to inform MOM through the Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) on the ground or FWMOMCare mobile app. MOM will work with LTA and the relevant dormitory operators to improve the transport situation accordingly."
2023-11-06-T-049-S-01470,2023-11-06-T-049,1470,Rachel Ong,asked the Minister for National Development whether a limit can be set for the maximum number of days for demolition and hacking works to be carried out in landed housing areas with residential homes and buildings located less than 150 metres from the worksite.
2023-11-06-T-049-S-01471,2023-11-06-T-049,1471,Desmond Lee,"The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) regulates building works to ensure that they are carried out safely and do not impair the structural integrity of adjacent buildings. However, BCA does not impose a limit on the duration of such works as the amount of time taken will vary depending on factors, such as the scale and complexity of the works."
2023-11-06-T-049-S-01472,2023-11-06-T-049,1472,Desmond Lee,"The Member may wish to refer to the full written response provided on 3 July 2023 to her Parliamentary Question on the limit to number of days for demolition works in landed housing areas near residential sites. [Please refer to ""Limit to Number of Days for Demolition Works in Landed Housing Areas Near Residential Sites"", Official Report, 3 July 2023, Vol 95, Issue 105, Written Answers to Questions section.]"
2023-11-06-T-050-S-01473,2023-11-06-T-050,1473,Ong Hua Han,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA will consider implementing wayfinding floor graphics pointing towards elevators at MRT platforms which are more visible for wheelchair users and the elderly when they exit from train cabins during peak hours; and (b) if so, whether a timeline can be provided for when commuters can expect to see these enhancements implemented."
2023-11-06-T-050-S-01474,2023-11-06-T-050,1474,Chee Hong Tat,"At present, all Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations have “Priority Use” signs to help wheelchair users and the elderly find their way to the lifts at train platforms. These signs also encourage other commuters to give way to those who need the lift. Operators are trialling directional floor stickers at the station concourse to help with navigation to station exits."
2023-11-06-T-050-S-01475,2023-11-06-T-050,1475,Chee Hong Tat,"LTA has assessed the Member’s suggestion to add wayfinding graphics on the floor of MRT platforms by consulting various social service agencies (SSAs), including the Handicap Welfare Association and Muscular Dystrophy Association Singapore. The SSAs gave feedback that such signages may be less visible to some users during peak hours compared to existing signages. As an alternative, floor tactile guiding systems are available at all MRT stations, including the train platforms. While these primarily serve to guide commuters with visual impairment to the nearest lift, they can also be used for navigation by other commuters."
2023-11-06-T-050-S-01476,2023-11-06-T-050,1476,Chee Hong Tat,"Beyond infrastructural enhancements, we encourage commuters to offer assistance to others, such as seniors and commuters with mobility needs, during their daily commute. Through the Caring SG Commuter Committee, we will continue to promote a more inclusive and caring commuter culture."
2023-11-06-T-051-S-01477,2023-11-06-T-051,1477,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the lessons learnt from the recent disruptions to the various digital services; and (b) whether the Government will step up regulations to minimise risks of data centre outage and to ensure the resiliency of data centre services in Singapore.
2023-11-06-T-051-S-01478,2023-11-06-T-051,1478,Josephine Teo,"The specifics of the recent outage affecting banking services have been, or will be, addressed in response to related Parliamentary Questions. I will focus on the broader digital infrastructure landscape and the Government’s approach to enhancing its security and resilience."
2023-11-06-T-051-S-01479,2023-11-06-T-051,1479,Josephine Teo,"Where a data centre supports the delivery of essential services or other nationally important systems, we have regulation in place to ensure its security and resilience. For example, the Cyber Security Agency identifies and regulates Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), which can include computer systems situated in a data centre that are necessary for the provision of essential services in sectors, such as the Government, infocomm, and banking and finance. In addition, sector regulators impose requirements on the service providers in their sectors. Major telcos and banks, for instance, are regulated by the Infocomm Media Development Authority and Monetary Authority of Singapore respectively, for security and resilience. Exercises and audits are conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of service providers’ security and resilience measures."
2023-11-06-T-051-S-01480,2023-11-06-T-051,1480,Josephine Teo,"With more of our economic activity moving online and the growing interconnectedness of our systems, the Government recognises the need to further study our reliance on different components of digital infrastructure, the risks and impact of disruptions, and the need for more interventions. For example, data centres may not all host CII systems but collectively provide foundational services for the proper functioning of our economy. Today, most data centre operators already adopt a risk management approach in line with international standards, including the implementation of measures to ensure resilience. The Government is studying whether and how best to strengthen the security and resilience of data centres as a category of digital infrastructure with significant impact. This may include risk-calibrated regulation for data centres, taking reference from international standards and best practices."
2023-11-06-T-051-S-01481,2023-11-06-T-051,1481,Josephine Teo,"However, we must recognise that regulation alone will not fully eliminate the possibility of outages and disruptions. Industries and enterprises must also play their part. To ensure consumer confidence, entities, such as banks, telcos and digital service providers, should take steps to mitigate risks and ensure the continued delivery of important digital services even when outages or disruptions occur."
2023-11-06-T-052-S-01482,2023-11-06-T-052,1482,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will review and revise the Workfare Income Supplement scheme to expand the age groups and the amount.
2023-11-06-T-052-S-01483,2023-11-06-T-052,1483,Tan See Leng,"The Workfare Income Supplement Scheme was recently enhanced in January 2023. As part of the enhancements, we extended Workfare to younger lower-income workers aged 30 to 34 years, from 35 years and older previously. We also increased the maximum Workfare payments to $4,200 per year, up from $4,000 per year previously."
2023-11-06-T-052-S-01484,2023-11-06-T-052,1484,Tan See Leng,"Workfare is not provided to workers aged below 30, as most of them would have just started work and earning starting wages. Most of them would have the potential for future wage growth and it will be premature to consider them for Workfare."
2023-11-06-T-052-S-01485,2023-11-06-T-052,1485,Tan See Leng,"As announced by Prime Minister Lee at National Day Rally 2023, the Government will be further enhancing Workfare. More details will be announced at next year’s Budget."
2023-11-06-T-052-S-01486,2023-11-06-T-052,1486,Tan See Leng,"The Government has also recently announced a $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package in September, which provides additional relief for all Singaporean households, with more support for lower- to middle-income families. This package builds on the existing support provided to households at Budget 2023. Combined, the support provided this year will, on average, fully cover the increases in spending by lower-income households this year, due to inflation and the GST rate increase, and substantially cover the increases in spending by middle-income households."
2023-11-06-T-053-S-01487,2023-11-06-T-053,1487,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development having regard to the Government’s announcement of the new classification of HDB flats and conditions attached to Plus and Prime housing models in August 2023, whether there will be a review of the conditions attached to owners purchasing HDB Executive Condominiums (ECs) with a view to ensure that the ECs will continue to be relatively affordable and accessible in the resale market after completion of the minimum occupation periods."
2023-11-06-T-053-S-01488,2023-11-06-T-053,1488,Desmond Lee,The Executive Condominium (EC) Housing Scheme was introduced to provide an affordable option for higher-income Singaporeans who aspire to own private housing. EC developments are strata-titled and have similar design features and facilities to private condominium developments. There are also fewer restrictions on the purchase of EC units as compared to HDB flats.
2023-11-06-T-053-S-01489,2023-11-06-T-053,1489,Desmond Lee,"The measures in place to keep EC units affordable include eligibility conditions, such as citizenship, age and income ceiling, to buy EC units directly from developers, and restrictions on ownership and resale. There is a minimum occupation period of five years from the date of issue of the Temporary Occupation Permit, during which the EC units cannot be sold on the open market or fully rented out. Thereafter, during the next five years, EC units can only be sold to Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. From the eleventh year onwards, EC units can be transacted as regular private housing. The resale restrictions help to moderate the prices of resale EC units."
2023-11-06-T-053-S-01490,2023-11-06-T-053,1490,Desmond Lee,"Since 2021, three rounds of cooling measures have been implemented to promote a sustainable property market."
2023-11-06-T-053-S-01491,2023-11-06-T-053,1491,Desmond Lee,The Government will continue to review our housing policies to ensure that the EC Housing Scheme remains relevant in meeting the housing needs of Singaporeans.
2023-11-06-T-054-S-01492,2023-11-06-T-054,1492,See Jinli Jean,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans under the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy to introduce “calm spaces” in public venues, like those of the National Gallery Singapore’s Calm Room, to cater to individuals with invisible disabilities; and (b) if so, where and when will these “calm spaces” be rolled out."
2023-11-06-T-054-S-01493,2023-11-06-T-054,1493,Ong Ye Kung,"Dedicated calm or quiet spaces have been set up in several places, such as the National Gallery, National Library branches, dementia day care centres and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), as an adjunct measure to provide a private and safe space for individuals to calm down."
2023-11-06-T-054-S-01494,2023-11-06-T-054,1494,Ong Ye Kung,"In our dense urban environment, through land use planning and building codes, we have ensured that there are public places of peace and quiet available for all to take a moment to relax and seek calm."
2023-11-06-T-054-S-01495,2023-11-06-T-054,1495,Ong Ye Kung,"There are no plans under the Strategy to introduce public ""calm spaces"" dedicated to a single client group, but we welcome such ground-up efforts to promote mental well-being. All of us play a part in improving the mental health and well-being of our population."
2023-11-06-T-055-S-01496,2023-11-06-T-055,1496,Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for National Development (a) under what circumstances does the Ministry require ground floor HDB flat dwellers to remove canopies at the back of their HDB flats; and (b) whether the Ministry can work with the National Environment Agency to resolve high-rise littering problems in HDB estates before requiring the removal of such awnings.
2023-11-06-T-055-S-01497,2023-11-06-T-055,1497,Desmond Lee,"Flat owners who wish to install any items on HDB common property are required to seek permission from the respective Town Council, which will seek HDB’s consent before granting permission."
2023-11-06-T-055-S-01498,2023-11-06-T-055,1498,Desmond Lee,"Canopies installed on common property behind ground floor units without the Town Council’s permission are unauthorised installations. Town Councils can take enforcement action to remove such unauthorised installations, as they may pose safety and fire hazards to the public."
2023-11-06-T-055-S-01499,2023-11-06-T-055,1499,Desmond Lee,"High-rise littering is a serious form of anti-social behaviour that poses dangers to public safety and health. The National Environment Agency (NEA) works with Town Councils to tackle high-rise littering, such as conducting educational outreach to raise awareness of the effects of such anti-social behaviour. For areas with persistent high-rise littering, NEA deploys surveillance cameras and takes strict enforcement action."
2023-11-06-T-056-S-01500,2023-11-06-T-056,1500,Don Wee,"asked the Prime Minister following the European Banking Authority's latest requirement for banks to incorporate environmental risks into calculations of their core capital, whether MAS will consider revising the risk-based capital adequacy requirements for local banks to reflect such climate risks in their credit decisions."
2023-11-06-T-056-S-01501,2023-11-06-T-056,1501,Lawrence Wong,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s banking capital rules are in line with internationally-agreed standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). These rules already provide banks the flexibility to incorporate climate risk considerations when determining the regulatory capital that they are required to maintain. This was also clarified by BCBS last year. For example, a bank should consider a borrower’s exposure to climate risks in its credit risk assessment. This would impact the capital that the bank is required to hold for a loan to the borrower under our risk-based capital rules."
2023-11-06-T-056-S-01502,2023-11-06-T-056,1502,Lawrence Wong,"The enhancements proposed by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to its capital framework largely reflect these clarifications. Aside from this, EBA has pointed to the importance of international coordination via BCBS for any fundamental revisions to the banking capital framework. This is MAS’ view as well."
2023-11-06-T-056-S-01503,2023-11-06-T-056,1503,Lawrence Wong,"Beyond capital requirements, MAS has issued guidance in 2020, setting out our supervisory expectations for banks to have sound governance and risk management frameworks to manage environmental risks. MAS is also currently consulting on proposed Guidelines on Transition Planning by banks to enable the global transition to a net-zero economy. MAS is the first amongst global supervisors to do so. A key proposal is for banks to engage their customers on the environmental risks they face and work closely with them to implement effective measures to build resilience to climate change."
2023-11-06-T-056-S-01504,2023-11-06-T-056,1504,Lawrence Wong,MAS will continually review its regulatory and supervisory approach to keep pace with global best practices in this area. This includes working closely with other regulators to foster alignment and consistency in international standards.
2023-11-06-T-057-S-01505,2023-11-06-T-057,1505,Hazel Poa,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether expenses incurred by public officers for mental healthcare treatments, such as therapy sessions and medications at public or private medical institutions, are reimbursable under the MediSave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient medical benefits scheme; and (b) whether the Government intends to improve the medical benefits for mental healthcare for public officers and, if not, why not."
2023-11-06-T-057-S-01506,2023-11-06-T-057,1506,Chan Chun Sing,"Yes, under our medical benefits schemes, public officers can seek reimbursement for medical treatments for mental health conditions prescribed by doctors registered with the Singapore Medical Council and carried out at hospitals/clinics licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, subject to the prevailing guidelines."
2023-11-06-T-057-S-01507,2023-11-06-T-057,1507,Chan Chun Sing,"The Public Service has been and will continue to enhance its efforts to care for and look after the mental health of officers. Public officers can access free counselling through a mental health hotline which provides a safe channel to speak to trained counsellors. A wide range of mental health programmes has been curated to support public officers, such as mindline@work, which is a one-stop repository of self-help resources, and wellness activities that cover topics relating to mental well-being, physical health and nutrition. The Public Service also has a network of over 2,000 mental health ambassadors who are trained to look out for and support officers who may appear stressed or need to talk to someone."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01508,2023-11-06-T-058,1508,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Prime Minister regarding the recent service outage by banks caused by data centre failures (a) whether MAS will have more oversight over the banks and mandate that there should be built-in redundancy systems to prevent outages at data centres; and (b) what are MAS’ plans to ensure similar situations do not occur in the future.
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01509,2023-11-06-T-058,1509,Lawrence Wong,"Let me start with the causes and impact of the disruption on 14 October 2023. DBS and Citibank experienced system outages in the mid-afternoon of 14 October 2023 which affected their banking and payment services. These outages were caused by a malfunction of the cooling system in the data centre hosting both DBS’ and Citibank’s IT systems. These IT systems support the delivery of retail and corporate banking services. The temperature in the data centre rose above the optimal operating range, causing the banks’ IT systems to shut down."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01510,2023-11-06-T-058,1510,Lawrence Wong,"To restore the impacted services, DBS and Citibank immediately activated their IT disaster recovery and business continuity plans. However, both banks encountered technical issues which prevented them from fully recovering their affected systems at their respective back-up data centres  DBS due to a network misconfiguration and Citibank due to connectivity issues. Services at DBS and Citibank were progressively recovered from 8.21 pm and 7.05 pm respectively on 14 October, but only fully recovered in the early hours of 15 October."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01511,2023-11-06-T-058,1511,Lawrence Wong,"The impact of the service outage was wide. Up to 810,000 attempts to access the digital banking platforms of both banks were estimated to have failed between 2.54 pm on 14 Oct 2023 and 4.47 am on 15 October 2023. Approximately 2.5 million payment and ATM transactions could not be completed. DBS reopened its branches from 5.30 pm to 9.30 pm on 14 October to assist affected customers. Both banks provided updates via social media platforms."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01512,2023-11-06-T-058,1512,Lawrence Wong,"Let me now address the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)’s requirements on banks’ business continuity, IT infrastructure resilience and their outsourced services involving critical IT systems. MAS requires banks to establish IT disaster recovery plans and test them regularly. Banks must conduct disaster recovery exercises with their back-up data centres to validate that critical systems and services can be restored within four hours of an outage. The unscheduled downtime for a critical system affecting a bank’s operations or service to customers must not exceed four hours within any 12-month period."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01513,2023-11-06-T-058,1513,Lawrence Wong,"MAS does not oversee banks’ external service providers, which are typically not financial institutions. This is similar to the approach taken by regulators in major jurisdictions. The onus is on the banks to ensure that the external service providers they appoint to support their operations or service to customers can meet MAS’ requirements on operational resilience. MAS also requires banks to maintain close oversight of external service providers, so that they can deliver services with minimal disruptions."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01514,2023-11-06-T-058,1514,Lawrence Wong,"DBS and Citibank have fallen short of MAS’ requirements to ensure that their critical IT systems are resilient against prolonged disruptions. While both banks conducted annual exercises to test the recovery of their IT systems at the back-up data centres, the specific issues that led to the delays in system recovery on 14 October did not surface during those tests."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01515,2023-11-06-T-058,1515,Lawrence Wong,I will now elaborate on the accountability and remediation measures taken to uphold the reliability and recoverability of banking services.
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01516,2023-11-06-T-058,1516,Lawrence Wong,"First, holding banks accountable. Under the Banking Act, MAS can impose a fine of up to $100,000 on financial institutions found in breach of MAS’ requirements on technology risk management. With the passing of the Financial Services and Markets Act in 2022, which will progressively come into force next year, this fine quantum will be increased to a maximum of $1 million. While the fine quantum is relatively lower compared to those imposed by financial regulators in countries, such as the UK, it is consistent with existing local penalty regimes, such as those under the Telecommunications Act and the Personal Data Protection Act."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01517,2023-11-06-T-058,1517,Lawrence Wong,"Besides fines, MAS uses a range of regulatory tools to address lapses in banks’ risk management. This includes additional capital requirements and suspension of specified businesses or activities. In May 2023, in response to repeated outages, MAS imposed a multiplier of 1.8 times to DBS’ risk-weighted assets for operational risk. This translated to approximately S$1.6 billion in total additional regulatory capital at the time. Holding additional regulatory capital comes with costs for the bank. It increases cost of capital, a key metric that drives business decisions, such as dividends and investments. It is a drag on the return on capital which could, in turn, impact credit ratings and stock price of the bank."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01518,2023-11-06-T-058,1518,Lawrence Wong,"Banks are also accountable to their customers, but matters of compensation are better dealt with between the bank and its customers as it would be highly dependent on individual circumstances. MAS expects banks to have a fair process to deal with this."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01519,2023-11-06-T-058,1519,Lawrence Wong,"Second, remediation. MAS has instructed both DBS and Citibank to conduct thorough investigations into the root causes of the incidents that occurred on 14 October, put in place remediation measures to minimise future outages and strengthen their recoverability in the event of an outage. In addition, they are required to provide to MAS regular system availability reports relating to their critical systems. MAS will also work with the financial industry to incorporate key learnings from these incidents into all banks’ risk management controls, MAS’ future technology risk supervisory approach and the next financial sector business continuity exercise scheduled for 2024."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01520,2023-11-06-T-058,1520,Lawrence Wong,"MAS has adopted a tougher stance against DBS because it experienced five disruptions to its banking services in the last eight months. This is unacceptable. As directed by MAS, DBS convened a Special Board Committee earlier this year to oversee a full review of its IT resilience by an independent external expert. The review has been completed and DBS has set out a technology resiliency roadmap to address the findings and improve system resilience."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01521,2023-11-06-T-058,1521,Lawrence Wong,"To ensure that DBS keeps a sharp focus on restoring the resilience of its digital banking services, MAS has prohibited DBS from making any non-essential IT changes or acquiring any new business ventures for a six-month period. There must not be distractions that take away the needed resources and attention by the bank to strengthen its technology risk management systems and controls. MAS has also barred DBS from reducing the size of its branch and ATM networks in Singapore until MAS is satisfied with the progress of DBS’ remediation."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01522,2023-11-06-T-058,1522,Lawrence Wong,"Another dimension of remediation has to do with data centres, which host the IT systems of not just the banks but also other critical sectors. The Government is studying how best to further strengthen the security and resilience of data centres where lapses could result in a significant impact."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01523,2023-11-06-T-058,1523,Lawrence Wong,"Finally, contingency measures in the face of banking disruptions. No IT system is infallible. Disruptions can occur for a variety of reasons and can happen without warning. When they do occur, MAS expects banks to take prompt steps to reduce inconvenience and costs to customers. This includes being proactive and transparent in updating affected customers on the status of service recovery and alternative services."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01524,2023-11-06-T-058,1524,Lawrence Wong,"While our banking system is generally robust, customers, too, must plan and prepare for contingencies. They can benefit from having alternative payment options and not be over-reliant on one provider for time-sensitive transactions. Indeed, during this recent service disruption, customers who were able to switch to alternative payment providers or use cash as a last resort would have been less affected."
2023-11-06-T-058-S-01525,2023-11-06-T-058,1525,Lawrence Wong,"The digitalisation of financial services has brought significant convenience to the public. While some disruption from time to time is unavoidable, we expect financial institutions to build capabilities to safely recover from any disruption within a reasonable time period. Where financial institutions fail to do so, as with this incident, MAS will work with them to thoroughly investigate the incident, apply lessons learnt in our supervisory oversight of the financial industry and take necessary action to further strengthen the resilience of financial service delivery."
2023-11-06-T-059-S-01526,2023-11-06-T-059,1526,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the ongoing Israeli-Hamas conflict and Singapore’s principled position to uphold international law and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter (a) how have Singapore’s diplomatic relations with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the wider Middle East been affected; and (b) what lessons in foreign diplomacy can Singapore learn from this conflict."

2023-11-06-T-060-S-01535,2023-11-06-T-060,1535,K Shanmugam,"Restitution is voluntarily offered by accused persons. When an accused person offers restitution monies to the victim and the victim accepts the offer, the investigation officer may facilitate the payment of restitution where required."
2023-11-06-T-060-S-01536,2023-11-06-T-060,1536,K Shanmugam,"As far as possible, arrangements will be made for the restitution monies to be paid directly from the accused person to the victim. Where this is not possible, the investigation officer may act as an intermediary. In such a case, another officer will be required to witness the handing over of monies from the accused person to the investigation officer and, subsequently, from the investigation officer to the victim. The accused person and the victim will be informed of and must agree to this arrangement beforehand. In addition, supervisors are required to verify that the restitution was done properly."
2023-11-06-T-060-S-01537,2023-11-06-T-060,1537,K Shanmugam,"The entire process is documented, including the amount of restitution, the date and mode of payment, the name of the officers involved in facilitating the restitution, and the acknowledgement by the accused person and the victim that the restitution sum has been paid."

Such restitution will be recorded and may be subject to verification by the accused person and the victim during Court proceedings."
2023-11-06-T-060-S-01539,2023-11-06-T-060,1539,K Shanmugam,"In cases of theft or fraud, the recovered property may be returned to the rightful owner or seized by the Police for investigations or Court proceedings. If the seized property is no longer required for investigations or Court proceedings, the Police will apply to the Court for the property to be returned to the rightful owner. The seizure and return of property will also be documented."

2023-11-06-T-061-S-01541,2023-11-06-T-061,1541,K Shanmugam,The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) does not collect data of travellers who have issues with their biometrics during immigration clearance.
2023-11-06-T-061-S-01542,2023-11-06-T-061,1542,K Shanmugam,"Since 2020, ICA has implemented the Multi-Modal Biometrics System (MMBS). With MMBS, facial and iris images have replaced fingerprints as the main biometrics to identify travellers during immigration clearance. This addresses difficulties faced by some travellers, especially the elderly, who have aged, scarred or dry fingerprints."
2023-11-06-T-061-S-01543,2023-11-06-T-061,1543,K Shanmugam,"Conversely, for those who encounter difficulties with their facial and iris biometrics, they will be prompted to use their fingerprints instead."

The HUS compensation package is regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains market-competitive. The latest review was in January 2023, where the officers received a salary adjustment of between 3% and 8%. Since 2019, HUS officers have been receiving strategic payments at specific milestones in their career in the Home Team as part of the remuneration package."

2023-11-06-T-069-S-01566,2023-11-06-T-069,1566,Gan Kim Yong,The manufacturing sector accounts for about 22% of Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 13% of our total employment. The Ministry of Trade and Industry aims to maintain manufacturing’s share of GDP at around 20% and continue creating good manufacturing jobs for Singaporeans.
2023-11-06-T-070-S-01567,2023-11-06-T-070,1567,Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the reasons for the power outage or surge to Block 102 Potong Pasir Avenue 1 on 13 October 2023 which caused damage to electrical appliances in a significant number of homes; and (b) whether Singapore Power will make the necessary reparations to residents who suffered such damage.
2023-11-06-T-070-S-01568,2023-11-06-T-070,1568,Gan Kim Yong,"On 13 October 2023, SP PowerGrid (SPPG) was upgrading the Potong Pasir Avenue 1 substation."
2023-11-06-T-070-S-01569,2023-11-06-T-070,1569,Gan Kim Yong,"As part of the upgrading works, SPPG’s workers routed the power supply to a backup cable to maintain electricity supply for residents of the block. However, the backup cable was damaged due to a termite infestation. This led to voltage fluctuations which caused household appliances to trip or malfunction in 41 units in Block 102. SPPG resolved the situation within 30 minutes of its occurrence."
2023-11-06-T-070-S-01570,2023-11-06-T-070,1570,Gan Kim Yong,The Energy Market Authority has worked with SPPG to review their workflows for upgrading works. SPPG has also repaired the damaged cable and is working with the Jalan Besar Town Council to extend assistance to the affected residents.
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01571,2023-11-06-T-071,1571,Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how has Singapore improved its energy resilience over the last 10 years; (b) what are the potential disruptions to our energy resilience in the next 10 years; and (c) how does the Government plan to further strengthen our energy resilience.
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01572,2023-11-06-T-071,1572,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore addresses energy resilience in three ways  (a) source diversity of natural gas supplies, (b) adequacy of generation capacity, and (c) grid reliability."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01573,2023-11-06-T-071,1573,Gan Kim Yong,"First, on source diversity of gas supplies. About 95% of Singapore’s electricity needs are met by imported natural gas. We commissioned Singapore’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal 10 years ago to enable our power sector to complement the supply of piped natural gas from Indonesia and Malaysia. We are, therefore, able to import LNG from a diverse range of sources, including Australia, Qatar and the US."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01574,2023-11-06-T-071,1574,Gan Kim Yong,"During the energy crisis that was brought about by the Russia-Ukraine war, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) introduced a standby LNG facility to ensure that our power generation companies would still have sufficient fuel for power generation."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01575,2023-11-06-T-071,1575,Gan Kim Yong,"We expect natural gas to remain an important part of our energy mix. To this end, the Government will establish an entity to centralise the procurement and supply of gas for the power sector. This move will enable us to enter longer-term gas contracts for more stable prices and supply, as well as procure gas from diverse sources."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01576,2023-11-06-T-071,1576,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore LNG Corporation also plans to develop and build a second LNG terminal. This will address growing demand and enable Singapore to meet our power generation needs entirely with LNG, if necessary."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01577,2023-11-06-T-071,1577,Gan Kim Yong,"Second, on adequacy of generation capacity. Over the years, we have ensured sufficient generation capacity to meet growing electricity demand. Our current reserve margin is above the required reserve margin of 27%, which is meant to safeguard system reliability in the event of outages of generating units."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01578,2023-11-06-T-071,1578,Gan Kim Yong,"To ensure sufficient generation capacity in the years ahead, EMA has introduced a centralised process and will launch a Request for Proposal whenever we anticipate the need for new generation capacity in our power system. EMA launched the first request in July 2023 for new generation capacity to be ready by 2028."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01579,2023-11-06-T-071,1579,Gan Kim Yong,"This year, EMA also commissioned Meranti Power to build, own and operate two 340 megawatt Open Cycle Gas Turbine units which can be brought online quickly in less than 10 minutes when there are unplanned supply disruptions."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01580,2023-11-06-T-071,1580,Gan Kim Yong,"Finally, on grid reliability. Singapore’s grid has consistently achieved low annual average interruption times of less than one minute per customer. This makes our grid one of the most reliable in the world. EMA holds the national grid operator, SP Group, to stringent grid reliability standards. System demand and transmission network conditions are closely monitored in real time, 24/7, by EMA. SP Group also monitors our distribution network around-the-clock."
2023-11-06-T-071-S-01581,2023-11-06-T-071,1581,Gan Kim Yong,EMA will ensure that SP Group continues to invest sufficiently in grid infrastructure to maintain grid reliability.
2023-11-06-T-072-S-01582,2023-11-06-T-072,1582,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the plans for Singapore's participation in deep sea mining activities comply with the Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty which Singapore intends to ratify; and (b) if so, how."
2023-11-06-T-072-S-01583,2023-11-06-T-072,1583,Gan Kim Yong,"Ocean Mineral Singapore Pte Ltd (OMS) has an exploration contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA). However, the exploration contract does not allow OMS to commence exploitation of the deep seabed yet. Regulations governing exploitation are still being negotiated at ISA. Any future plans by Singapore companies for deep seabed mining, if and when permitted, will have to be aligned with the  Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ)"
2023-11-06-T-073-S-01584,2023-11-06-T-073,1584,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are regular inspections to ensure that road signs are in good condition and remain clear and visible to all road users; and (b) how often are they maintained and replaced.
2023-11-06-T-073-S-01585,2023-11-06-T-073,1585,Chee Hong Tat,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has an inspection regime to regularly check road signs, rectify defective road signs, and plan upgrades for road signs."
2023-11-06-T-073-S-01586,2023-11-06-T-073,1586,Chee Hong Tat,"LTA is also embarking on an islandwide exercise to replace approximately 4,200 road signs across our entire road network progressively commencing from the fourth quarter of 2023. This exercise is expected to be completed in three years."

2023-11-06-T-076-S-01592,2023-11-06-T-076,1592,Chee Hong Tat,The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) 2.0 system will not collect data when vehicles are outside of Singapore.
2023-11-06-T-077-S-01593,2023-11-06-T-077,1593,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are measures to safeguard the personal data and information on the driver’s journey under the next generation Electronic Road Pricing system; and (b) whether the Government will have access to the data and information collected for purposes, such as criminal investigations."
2023-11-06-T-077-S-01594,2023-11-06-T-077,1594,Chee Hong Tat,"The on-board units (OBU) under Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) 2.0 are designed with a high level of security and encryption. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will only use anonymised or aggregated data for traffic management and transport planning purposes. For vehicle-specific data, LTA will only use it for payment, charges and enforcement, such as against non-payment of ERP charges."
2023-11-06-T-077-S-01595,2023-11-06-T-077,1595,Chee Hong Tat,"LTA adheres to Government-wide standards for data security, including strict guidelines on data sharing with other Government agencies. Robust safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorised access. There are also criminal penalties for the unauthorised disclosure and improper use of information."
2023-11-06-T-078-S-01596,2023-11-06-T-078,1596,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Transport what is the expected cost to the Government for providing the installation of the ERP 2.0 on-board unit for vehicles.
2023-11-06-T-078-S-01597,2023-11-06-T-078,1597,Chee Hong Tat,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) awarded the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) 2.0 project to the consortium formed by NCS Pte Ltd and MHI Engine System Asia Pte Ltd at a cost of S$556 million in 2016. As the project is still ongoing, the overall project costs will only be finalised upon completion."
2023-11-06-T-079-S-01598,2023-11-06-T-079,1598,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the latest average daily ridership on public buses and trains on weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays respectively; (b) what is the average frequency of public buses and trains on weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays respectively, (c) how do the figures in (a) and (b) compare with pre-pandemic levels; (d) whether the Ministry will consider increasing bus and rail frequency on Saturdays and Sundays; and (e) if not, why."
2023-11-06-T-079-S-01599,2023-11-06-T-079,1599,Chee Hong Tat,"In the third quarter of 2023, average daily ridership on public buses and trains was 7.9 million on weekdays and 6.4 million on weekends. This is around 95% of pre-pandemic levels."
2023-11-06-T-079-S-01600,2023-11-06-T-079,1600,Chee Hong Tat,"The average frequency of trains is two to three minutes during weekday peak hours and around five minutes during weekday off-peak hours and on weekends. The average frequency of buses is seven to 10 minutes during weekday peak hours, and nine to 13 minutes during weekday off-peak hours and on weekends. The frequencies are comparable to pre-pandemic levels."
2023-11-06-T-079-S-01601,2023-11-06-T-079,1601,Chee Hong Tat,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) closely monitors the supply and demand for public transport services. When there are sustained changes to commuter demand, or if there are significant changes to the public transport network, such as after the opening of a new MRT line, LTA will make targeted adjustments to service frequencies. Based on current ridership and capacity, we have no plans to increase bus and rail frequencies across the board on weekends. Doing what the Member suggests will raise operating costs, which is, ultimately, borne by commuters and taxpayers through higher fares and taxes."
2023-11-06-T-080-S-01602,2023-11-06-T-080,1602,Hany Soh,"asked the Minister for Transport in view of LTA’s announcement on the ERP 2.0 system on 23 October 2023, whether the Ministry anticipates any increase in transportation costs to public transport riders and private vehicle owners."
2023-11-06-T-080-S-01603,2023-11-06-T-080,1603,Chee Hong Tat,There will be no difference in how motorists are charged under the current Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme. ERP rates will continue to be reviewed based on traffic speeds and congestion levels.
2023-11-06-T-081-S-01604,2023-11-06-T-081,1604,Hany Soh,"asked the Minister for Transport in view of LTA’s announcement on the ERP 2.0 system on 23 October 2023, how will the Ministry assuage any privacy concerns since the new on-board units that are installed in vehicles will be based on the Global Navigation Satellite System that reveals the real-time location details of drivers."
2023-11-06-T-081-S-01605,2023-11-06-T-081,1605,Chee Hong Tat,"There are strict safeguards in place to govern the collection, usage and storage of data. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will only use anonymised or aggregated data for traffic management and transport planning purposes. As for vehicle-specific data, LTA will only use it for payments, charges and enforcement, such as against non-payment of Electronic Road Pricing charges."
2023-11-06-T-082-S-01606,2023-11-06-T-082,1606,Derrick Goh,"asked the Minister for Transport whether Bus Service 804 can call at the bus stop in front of Yishun MRT so that residents living in the inner parts of Nee Soon neighbourhoods, such as Nee Soon Link which now includes the six new BTOs, can have better access to public transport without the need to walk into the bus interchange."
2023-11-06-T-082-S-01607,2023-11-06-T-082,1607,Derrick Goh,asked the Minister for Transport whether more bus services can be considered for residents who have moved into the new BTOs at Nee Soon Link Spring to improve public transport access as the bus stops in the area generally have only one bus service catering to six new BTO precincts.
2023-11-06-T-082-S-01608,2023-11-06-T-082,1608,Chee Hong Tat,"Residents from the new Nee Soon Link BTO precincts are currently served by Services 801 and 806 along Yishun Avenue 6 and Yishun Street 42, as well as Services 103, 117/M and 801 along Yishun Avenue 1. These bus services connect residents to amenities and transport nodes at Yishun and Khatib, where they can access other bus services and the MRT."
2023-11-06-T-082-S-01609,2023-11-06-T-082,1609,Chee Hong Tat,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been making service adjustments to serve the increased demand from the new BTO precincts. Service 801 was introduced in January 2022. Over 2023, LTA has been monitoring the situation and had increased the capacity of Services 801 as well as 103 by adding trips or using more double-deck buses. LTA has plans to further improve Services 801 and 117/M by end-2023."
2023-11-06-T-082-S-01610,2023-11-06-T-082,1610,Chee Hong Tat,"LTA has reviewed the Member’s suggestion to adjust Service 804. The bus stop in front of Yishun MRT Station is heavily utilised, with up to 90 to 95 buses from six bus services in the heaviest peak hour. As site constraints prevent further expansion of the bus stop, increasing the number of buses calling at this stop could result in long tailback of buses, which will impact other commuters. As such, we are unable to adjust Service 804 to call at that bus stop. Instead, we will study other ways to address the concerns that Mr Derrick Goh has raised on behalf of his residents."
2023-11-06-T-083-S-01611,2023-11-06-T-083,1611,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA regulates operators of publicly accessible electric vehicle charging points to ensure minimum service standards, such as operational downtime; (b) if so, what are these standards; and (c) what are LTA’s findings when working with such operators."
2023-11-06-T-083-S-01612,2023-11-06-T-083,1612,Chee Hong Tat,"Under the Electric Vehicles Charging Act (EVCA), which will commence by end 2023, all electric vehicle charging operators (EVCOs) will need to be licensed and subject to a set of licensing conditions. These include data sharing with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and maintaining the service uptimes of their chargers in their network."
2023-11-06-T-083-S-01613,2023-11-06-T-083,1613,Chee Hong Tat,LTA currently enforces strict network serviceability requirements for electric vehicle (EV) charging points under the mass tender for public carparks at Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates. The EVCOs are required to ensure that the chargers are serviceable for over 97% of the time. All EVCOs have currently met their obligations on EV charging point serviceability.
2023-11-06-T-084-S-01614,2023-11-06-T-084,1614,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider expanding programmes to educate parents on the associated risks of cyber-addiction among the young and to provide guidelines for ensuring a conducive home environment to combat this growing challenge.
2023-11-06-T-084-S-01615,2023-11-06-T-084,1615,Chan Chun Sing,"Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children to be discerning in their use of devices and online interactions. Schools work closely with parents by sharing resources, expert insights and strategies on managing a range of cyber issues. Through Parent Support Groups  and community partners, schools also reach out to parents to equip them with the necessary digital knowledge and skills."
2023-11-06-T-084-S-01616,2023-11-06-T-084,1616,Chan Chun Sing,"As part of the Interagency Taskforce for Mental Health and Well-being, the Ministry of Education is also working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Communications and Information to develop a Parents’ Toolbox to support parents to manage their children’s device use, so that they can navigate and thrive in the digital world safely."
2023-11-06-T-085-S-01617,2023-11-06-T-085,1617,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for Education in light of the schools in Zhenghua facing challenges in securing canteen vendors, resulting in limited food options, whether the Ministry is considering alternative service models to consistently provide healthy and affordable student meals."
2023-11-06-T-085-S-01618,2023-11-06-T-085,1618,Chan Chun Sing,"Most schools, including those in Zhenghua, have canteen stalls providing healthy and affordable meals for students"
2023-11-06-T-085-S-01619,2023-11-06-T-085,1619,Chan Chun Sing,"Some schools already use a pre-order meal service model. The Ministry of Education will continue to support schools in providing healthy and affordable meals for students, including through alternative service models."
2023-11-06-T-086-S-01620,2023-11-06-T-086,1620,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry will provide an update on the take-up rate for the Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity (SP-CCA) programmes for secondary schools; and (b) whether there are plans to expand the SP-CCA to allow more students to benefit.
2023-11-06-T-086-S-01621,2023-11-06-T-086,1621,Chan Chun Sing,"Jointly offered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity (SP-CCA) allows secondary students from different schools to come together to pursue their interest in sports and arts beyond what is offered at their schools. There are over 150 students from 68 schools in the three SP-CCAs, namely, Athletics, Water Polo and Ethnic Dance."
2023-11-06-T-086-S-01622,2023-11-06-T-086,1622,Chan Chun Sing,"This year, students in SP-CCA Athletics and Water Polo participated at the National School Games and other sports events, while those in SP-CCA Ethnic Dance performed at the Singapore Youth Festival."
2023-11-06-T-086-S-01623,2023-11-06-T-086,1623,Chan Chun Sing,MOE will continue to work closely with our partners to monitor student interest and consider offering SP-CCA in more areas in the next few years.
2023-11-06-T-087-S-01624,2023-11-06-T-087,1624,Mariam Jaafar,"asked the Minister for Education (a) how many schools do not offer mental health services under the Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH) programme; and (b) for each year in the past five years, how many students have been assisted under REACH services."
2023-11-06-T-087-S-01625,2023-11-06-T-087,1625,Chan Chun Sing,Students with mental health concerns in all
2023-11-06-T-087-S-01626,2023-11-06-T-087,1626,Chan Chun Sing,"In the past five years, the REACH teams received an average of some 1,500 referrals from Ministry of Education schools per year."
2023-11-06-T-088-S-01627,2023-11-06-T-088,1627,Carrie Tan,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many online ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) applications have been made since its implementation; (b) how much funds have been expended on developing the IT infrastructure to enable such online applications; (c) whether a review will be conducted to evaluate this implementation; and (d) what actual costs and benefits are incurred and reaped thus far for the applicants and administrators.
2023-11-06-T-088-S-01628,2023-11-06-T-088,1628,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since the introduction of online applications for ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) via SupportGoWhere, about 13% of applications have been made online. The Ministry of Social and Family Development expects the proportion of applications made online to increase over time."
2023-11-06-T-088-S-01629,2023-11-06-T-088,1629,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"There are several benefits to using the SMTA online application. Apart from being available 24/7, the portal taps on MyInfo to auto-populate relevant personal information, thereby reducing manual data entry. Applicants can submit relevant supporting documents directly through the portal and also track the status of their application and how much assistance they have received, without having to separately contact the Social Services Office (SSO). The system also reduces the need for further manual entry by SSO officers. Furthermore, aside from ComCare applications, the SupportGoWhere portal also enables clients to find information on other social assistance schemes offered by different agencies and check their eligibility for such schemes on a single portal, increasing clients’ access to more comprehensive and convenient support."
2023-11-06-T-088-S-01630,2023-11-06-T-088,1630,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The cost of developing the portal for SMTA online applications was about $1.5 million. We estimate that each client can save about 50 minutes through submitting an online application instead of a physical application at the SSO, and each SSO officer can save about 45 minutes in processing an online application instead of a physical application. Since the launch of the portal, we estimate that more than 10,000 and 9,000 manhours have been saved by clients and SSO officers respectively."
2023-11-06-T-089-S-01631,2023-11-06-T-089,1631,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for each year in the past five years, what is the number of Child Protection Service (CPS) cases where the family of origin has been deemed unfit for the child to return to; and (b) what are the top three reasons why the family of origin has been deemed unfit for the child to return to."
2023-11-06-T-089-S-01632,2023-11-06-T-089,1632,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Each year, about 2% of cases investigated by the Child Protective Service (CPS) resulted in the child being unable to return home as their families of origin were assessed to be unfit to safely care for their children."
2023-11-06-T-089-S-01633,2023-11-06-T-089,1633,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The reasons include parents’ chronic incarceration, serious mental health conditions of the parents, or their unwillingness to provide a safe environment for their child, even when professionals offer intervention and support."
2023-11-06-T-090-S-01634,2023-11-06-T-090,1634,See Jinli Jean,"asked the Minister for Health (a) for each year from 2019, how many Singaporeans qualified for Project Silver Screen which provides functional screening of the eyes, ears and oral health for Singaporeans aged 60 and above; (b) what is the yearly participation rate; (c) how many who participated are prescribed assistive devices for decline in (i) vision, (ii) hearing and (iii) oral health; (d) what proportion per each category has qualified for Government funding for assistive devices; and (e) how many have purchased the prescribed assistive devices; and (f) what proportion of these devices are funded by the Government."
2023-11-06-T-090-S-01635,2023-11-06-T-090,1635,Ong Ye Kung,"As part of the Ministry of Health's efforts to extend preventive health to the population, community functional screening was launched nationwide in 2018. Called Project Silver Screen (PSS), it is available to all Singapore Residents aged 60 and above, at a cost of $5 or less. Excluding the COVID-19 years when the programme was suspended, on average, about 28,000 seniors participated in PSS each year."
2023-11-06-T-090-S-01636,2023-11-06-T-090,1636,Ong Ye Kung,The number and proportion of Singapore Resident seniors who were prescribed assistive devices and purchased assistive devices from 2019 to 2022 are as follows
2023-11-06-T-090-S-01637,2023-11-06-T-090,1637,Ong Ye Kung,"We provide each senior who requires assistive devices with a voucher of up to $200 per set of device, regardless of household income. This is over and above Government support, such as the Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund, for eligible seniors. We do not have the breakdown of actual Government subsidies provided based on assistive device type. We will continue to work with our partners to encourage seniors to participate in PSS and facilitate the take-up of required assistive devices."
2023-11-06-T-091-S-01638,2023-11-06-T-091,1638,Lim Wee Kiak,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how many registered day surgery centres are there in the public and private sectors; (b) from 2019 to 2022, what is the annual number of surgeries carried out in these centres; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider allowing more minimally invasive procedures to be done in these centres to cut down on the need for costly hospitalisation and lighten the demands on our healthcare system."
2023-11-06-T-091-S-01639,2023-11-06-T-091,1639,Ong Ye Kung,"As of October 2023, there are a total of 66 licensed day surgery centres in the public and private sector."
2023-11-06-T-091-S-01640,2023-11-06-T-091,1640,Ong Ye Kung,"The annual number of surgeries and procedures performed at day surgery centres has risen from 509,000 in 2019 to 565,000 in 2022."
2023-11-06-T-091-S-01641,2023-11-06-T-091,1641,Ong Ye Kung,"All surgical procedures, including minimally invasive procedures, should be performed in an appropriately equipped day surgery centre, as long as the patient is assessed by a competent doctor to not require a hospital admission for perioperative monitoring and care and is not at high risk of post-procedural complications."
2023-11-06-T-092-S-01642,2023-11-06-T-092,1642,Don Wee,asked the Minister for Health in each of the last five years (a) how many cases of inappropriate claims have been made by doctors involving MediShield Life; (b) what is the monetary quantum involved; (c) how many cases of valid claims have been wrongfully denied by insurers and what is the quantum involved; and (d) what new measures are in place to ensure that the investigative teams have sufficient resources and authorisation support to conduct enforcement.
2023-11-06-T-092-S-01643,2023-11-06-T-092,1643,Ong Ye Kung,"Since October 2022, the Claims Management Office (CMO) has adjudicated 32 claims, and another 70 are currently being adjudicated. Out of the 32 claims processed, 29 were assessed by relevant panels of specialists from the public and private sectors to be inappropriate and which amounted to about $400,000."
2023-11-06-T-092-S-01644,2023-11-06-T-092,1644,Ong Ye Kung,"Where inappropriate claim behaviours are found, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will take required enforcement action under the terms and conditions of the MediSave MediShield Life Schemes. For serious cases, providers may also be referred to the Singapore Police Force for further investigation or to the Singapore Medical Council for professional or ethical breaches."
2023-11-06-T-092-S-01645,2023-11-06-T-092,1645,Ong Ye Kung,MOH and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) do not track the number and quantum of Integrated Shield Plan claims that have been denied by insurers. MAS requires insurers to be fair in their treatment of policyholders. Policyholders who feel that their claims have been wrongfully denied can seek recourse with the Clinical Claims Resolution Process and the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre.
2023-11-06-T-093-S-01646,2023-11-06-T-093,1646,Syed Harun Alhabsyi,"asked the Minister for Health in view that the Academy of Medicine Singapore (AMS) has membership details and personal data of senior clinicians in the medical fraternity, many of whom also work in the private and public sectors, whether the recent leak of personal data and information at AMS in September 2023 has had any impact on the Ministry’s operations and data security."
2023-11-06-T-093-S-01647,2023-11-06-T-093,1647,Ong Ye Kung,"The recent data breach by the Academy of Medicine Singapore (AMS) did not affect Ministry of Health (MOH)’s operations and data security, as there are no system connections nor Government data shared between MOH and AMS."
2023-11-06-T-093-S-01648,2023-11-06-T-093,1648,Ong Ye Kung,The incident was reported to the Personal Data Protection Commission Singapore and investigations are currently ongoing.
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01649,2023-11-06-T-094,1649,Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether actions are being considered to address the disparities in mental health coverage among the six Integrated Shield Plan (IP) providers and, if so, what are they; and (b) whether the Ministry will develop any guidelines or standards to ensure a basic level of mental health coverage across all IP providers."
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01650,2023-11-06-T-094,1650,Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are initiatives to bolster data collection and risk assessment concerning mental health to aid the underwriting processes of insurance companies and, if so, what are they; and (b) whether the Ministry collaborates with private insurers to foster a better understanding and objective assessment of mental health risks."
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01651,2023-11-06-T-094,1651,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Health (a) what measures are being taken to enhance public awareness regarding the availability and advantages of mental health insurance coverage; and (b) whether there are plans by the Ministry to incentivise private insurance companies to broaden their mental health insurance offerings.
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01652,2023-11-06-T-094,1652,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will be providing guidelines to the insurance industry on the classification of mental health insurance as they develop the product coverage; and (b) whether there are sufficient independent assessors in the industry for objective assessments of mental well-being to help the insurers underwrite the coverage for mental conditions.
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01653,2023-11-06-T-094,1653,Ong Ye Kung,"All Singaporeans and Permanent Residents are covered under MediShield Life (MSHL). MSHL provides coverage for hospitalisation, including inpatient mental health treatments and selected costly outpatient treatments."
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01654,2023-11-06-T-094,1654,Ong Ye Kung,"Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) and other private health insurance plans offer optional coverage on top of MSHL. Today, all IP insurers offer plans that cover inpatient mental health treatment, with varying claim limits. Coverage, underwriting decisions and premiums are subject to insurers’ actuarial and commercial considerations. Insurers assess risks based on reliable information relevant to the risks being insured, which may include medical reports, clinical surveys or studies."
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01655,2023-11-06-T-094,1655,Ong Ye Kung,"Insurance is useful for financing costly but low-incidence treatments. For outpatient treatments that are more frequently accessed and less costly, for example, treatment for chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and mental health conditions, insurance may be less useful. Instead, individuals may tap on subsidies and MediSave."
2023-11-06-T-094-S-01656,2023-11-06-T-094,1656,Ong Ye Kung,"If one is still unable to afford their mental health treatment despite Government subsidies, insurance and MediSave, MediFund is available at public healthcare institutions as a safety net to assist needy Singaporeans. The Ministry of Health will continue to regularly review our financing schemes to keep pace with evolving medical practice and patient needs."
2023-11-06-T-095-S-01657,2023-11-06-T-095,1657,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in each of the past five years, what percentage of Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS) card users are persons with special needs; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider introducing special subsidies for persons with special needs under CHAS."

In general, healthcare subsidies are provided based on the medical conditions of the patient and tiered based on their income level, so that more help can go to the lower-income."
2023-11-06-T-096-S-01659,2023-11-06-T-096,1659,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has data on the number of visits made on an annual basis to (i) public and (ii) private mental health providers, such as psychologists, in each of the last five years; and (b) whether the Ministry has data on the average consultation costs for private psychologists and counsellors."

2023-11-06-T-096-S-01661,2023-11-06-T-096,1661,Ong Ye Kung,MOH does not track the consultation costs for private psychologists and counsellors.
2023-11-06-T-097-S-01662,2023-11-06-T-097,1662,See Jinli Jean,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) for each year in the last five years, how many self-employed persons applied for housing loans from (i) HDB and (ii) financial institutions respectively; (b) of which, yearly, how many failed in their housing loan applications because they exceeded the (i) Mortgage Servicing Ratio for HDB and (ii) Total Debt Servicing Ratio for financial institutions; and (c) in the breakdown, how many of these self-employed persons are platform workers."
2023-11-06-T-097-S-01663,2023-11-06-T-097,1663,Desmond Lee,"In assessing applications for a Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing loan, HDB considers various factors, such as job stability, CPF contributions and monthly cash savings. In computing the eligible loan amount, HDB applies a set of mortgage financing guidelines, such as a maximum loan tenure of 25 years, loan-to-value limit of 80%, maximum Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) of 30%, and interest rate floor of 3% per annum to ensure prudent borrowing. HDB does not reject housing loan applications based on whether the applicant’s MSR exceeds a particular threshold."
2023-11-06-T-097-S-01664,2023-11-06-T-097,1664,Desmond Lee,The number of Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) who applied for HDB housing loans in the last five years is summarised in Table 1 below.
2023-11-06-T-097-S-01665,2023-11-06-T-097,1665,Desmond Lee,HDB does not have further breakdown on whether these SEPs are platform workers or not. The Government does not collect housing loan data from financial institutions on SEPs as requested by the Member.
2023-11-06-T-098-S-01666,2023-11-06-T-098,1666,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the regular tree inspections carried out by trained inspectors include checks on the obstruction of road signs due to the growth of trees; and (b) if not, how does the Ministry ensure that the growth of trees does not obstruct the visibility of the signs so as to ensure the safety of all road users."
2023-11-06-T-098-S-01667,2023-11-06-T-098,1667,Desmond Lee,"The National Parks Board (NParks) manages over two million urban trees in Singapore’s parks, park connectors, state lands and along roads."
2023-11-06-T-098-S-01668,2023-11-06-T-098,1668,Desmond Lee,"NParks’ trained arborists inspect trees once every six to 24 months and supervise the regular maintenance and pruning of trees. In doing so, the arborists would also check if any tree was obstructing the visibility of road signs and will carry out pruning so that road users can see the signs more clearly. To supplement these existing checks, NParks is also developing a visual tool which uses artificial intelligence to highlight tree foliage obstructing road signs."
2023-11-06-T-099-S-01669,2023-11-06-T-099,1669,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for National Development what is the Ministry doing to bring the launch of HDB BTO projects back on track to the usual months of February, May, August and November, in view of the delays and glitches with the newly introduced HDB Flat Eligibility letter system."
2023-11-06-T-099-S-01670,2023-11-06-T-099,1670,Desmond Lee,"While Build-To-Order (BTO) flats are typically launched in the months of February, May, August and November, this may be adjusted from time to time. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the planned May 2020 launch was postponed and combined with the August launch. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) strives to announce any changes to its launch exercises as early as possible to keep potential home buyers well-informed."
2023-11-06-T-099-S-01671,2023-11-06-T-099,1671,Desmond Lee,"In May 2023, technical glitches at the BTO and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) launch resulted in a delay of the ballot results. To provide applicants from the May launch sufficient time to receive their ballot results and make an informed decision before entering another launch exercise, HDB postponed the next BTO launch from August to early October. This will have some knock-on effects on the following launch, which has been postponed to December 2023."
2023-11-06-T-099-S-01672,2023-11-06-T-099,1672,Desmond Lee,"We remain committed to provide a steady supply of new flats and will continue to have regular launches throughout the year to meet housing demand. We remain on track to launch about 23,000 flats in 2023 and a total of 100,000 flats from 2021 to 2025."
2023-11-06-T-100-S-01673,2023-11-06-T-100,1673,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for National Development whether applicants who have been unsuccessful in ballots for HDB rental flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme may be provided with additional ballot chances akin to the priority scheme for first-time buyers of BTO flats.
2023-11-06-T-100-S-01674,2023-11-06-T-100,1674,Desmond Lee,"We revised the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) eligibility conditions and balloting process in August 2021 to prioritise families with greater need for temporary housing while waiting for their new flats. Married couples with at least one child aged 18 and below, including those who are expecting their first child, enjoy priority in the PPHS ballot. We have also more than doubled the PPHS supply from 800 units in 2021 to about 2,000 units currently."
2023-11-06-T-100-S-01675,2023-11-06-T-100,1675,Desmond Lee,"The PPHS application rate, or the number of applicants per flat offered in each exercise, has come down significantly, from over 20 times in 2021, to around three times this year. In recent exercises, all married couple applicants with children have had a chance to select a flat, along with other PPHS applicants."
2023-11-06-T-100-S-01676,2023-11-06-T-100,1676,Desmond Lee,"We are working to double the PPHS supply to 4,000 units by 2025. This will allow more households to benefit from PPHS, even as we continue to prioritise married couples with children. We currently have no plans to provide additional ballot chances to any applicant group."
2023-11-06-T-101-S-01677,2023-11-06-T-101,1677,Derrick Goh,"asked the Minister for National Development regarding the growing interest in and usage of digital real-estate tokens which fractionalise a property to lower capital outlays and investment barriers, what are the Government’s plans to (i) mitigate speculative behaviour and volatility in Singapore’s property market and (ii) prevent circumvention of property ownership or investment rules by these market participants."
2023-11-06-T-101-S-01678,2023-11-06-T-101,1678,Desmond Lee,"Currently, the real estate tokenisation industry in Singapore is still nascent and unlikely to introduce volatility to the property market. There is also currently no evidence to suggest that it has led to the circumvention of property ownership or investment rules."
2023-11-06-T-101-S-01679,2023-11-06-T-101,1679,Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, we are monitoring the situation closely and will adjust our policies as necessary to promote a stable and sustainable property market."
2023-11-06-T-102-S-01680,2023-11-06-T-102,1680,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Government will consider working with the Council for Estate Agencies to issue a set of sentencing guidelines setting out how the financial penalties for failure to perform customer due diligence measures or report suspicious transactions or activities, as provided in the Estate Agents Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism regulations, can be varied based on the size of the suspicious transactions or the potential commission earned; and (b) if not, why."
2023-11-06-T-102-S-01681,2023-11-06-T-102,1681,Desmond Lee,"Under the Estate Agents Act 2010 (EAA) and Estate Agents (Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism) Regulations 2021, property agencies and property agents are required to perform due diligence checks on their clients before commencing any business relationship or facilitating transaction with them. Failure to do so is a breach under EAA and may result in disciplinary action by a Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) Disciplinary Committee (DC)."
2023-11-06-T-102-S-01682,2023-11-06-T-102,1682,Desmond Lee,"The DC is an independent tribunal that assesses each case holistically to determine the appropriate penalties. DC will consider all relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the size of the transaction, the potential commission earned, the extent of the offender’s culpability, the degree of harm caused and whether there are other aggravating or mitigating factors. In meting out the appropriate penalties, DC may refer to past sentencing precedents of similar cases and adjust accordingly to address case-specific circumstances."
2023-11-06-T-102-S-01683,2023-11-06-T-102,1683,Desmond Lee,Information on CEA’s sentencing approach and the sentences meted out by DCs in the past are published on CEA’s website.
2023-11-06-T-103-S-01684,2023-11-06-T-103,1684,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information in view of recent outages of digital services affecting the banks and other essential platforms, what more can be done to ensure that the service providers (i) maintain minimal services during disruptions and (ii) be obligated to have business continuity plans to prevent the public and private sectors from being impacted negatively."
2023-11-06-T-103-S-01685,2023-11-06-T-103,1685,Josephine Teo,"The specifics of the recent outage affecting banking services have been, or will be, addressed in response to related Parliamentary Questions. This reply focuses on the broader digital infrastructure landscape and the Government’s approach to enhancing its security and resilience."
2023-11-06-T-103-S-01686,2023-11-06-T-103,1686,Josephine Teo,"Where a data centre supports the delivery of essential services or other nationally important systems, we have regulation in place to ensure its security and resilience. For example, the Cyber Security Agency identifies and regulates Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), which can include computer systems situated in a data centre that are necessary for the provision of essential services in sectors, such as the Government, infocomm, and banking and finance. In addition, sector regulators impose requirements on the service providers in their sectors. Major telecommunication operators (telcos) and banks, for instance, are regulated by the Infocomm Media Development Authority and Monetary Authority of Singapore respectively, for security and resilience. Exercises and audits are conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of service providers’ security and resilience measures."
2023-11-06-T-103-S-01687,2023-11-06-T-103,1687,Josephine Teo,"With more of our economic activity moving online and the growing interconnectedness of our systems, the Government recognises the need to further study our reliance on different components of digital infrastructure, the risks and impact of disruptions, and the need for more interventions. For example, data centres may not all host CII systems but collectively provide foundational services for the proper functioning of our economy. Today, most data centre operators already adopt a risk management approach in line with international standards, including the implementation of measures to ensure resilience. The Government is studying whether and how best to strengthen the security and resilience of data centres as a category of digital infrastructure with significant impact. This may include risk-calibrated regulation for data centres, taking reference from international standards and best practices."
2023-11-06-T-103-S-01688,2023-11-06-T-103,1688,Josephine Teo,"However, we must recognise that regulation alone will not fully eliminate the possibility of outages and disruptions. Industries and enterprises must also play their part. To ensure consumer confidence, entities, such as banks, telcos and digital service providers, should take steps to mitigate risks and ensure the continued delivery of important digital services even when outages or disruptions occur."
2023-11-06-T-104-S-01689,2023-11-06-T-104,1689,Mariam Jaafar,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) for each year in the past five years, how many national athletes have sought psychological support; and (b) whether the Government does periodic assessments of the mental health of athletes under the Sport Excellence Scholarship (spexScholarship) programme."

Cases requiring attention are flagged and assessed by the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI)'s sport science team. If clinical expertise is required, they will be referred to the Singapore Sport and Exercise Medicine Centre (SSMC@CGH) for follow-up with a trained psychiatrist or clinical psychologist."
