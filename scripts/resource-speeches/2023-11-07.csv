2023-11-07-T-001-S-00001,2023-11-07-T-001,1,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current rate of real wage growth in Singapore; (b) given rising cost of living concerns, what is the forecast for real wage growth for 2023 and how does this compare to previous years; and (c) what measures are being considered to support businesses in ensuring real wage growth for their employees."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00002,2023-11-07-T-001,2,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the cumulative impact of the series of price increases on wage growth; and (b) in light of these increases, whether there are concerns about the possibility of stagnating wage growth particularly for vulnerable Singapore workers."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00003,2023-11-07-T-001,3,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the real median income growth has kept pace with inflation over the past five years; (b) whether the latest data on real median income growth is within the Ministry’s expected range; and (c) whether there is a need for more stratified and sectoral data points considering the impact of the recent price increases on certain vulnerable groups of Singaporeans.
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00004,2023-11-07-T-001,4,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Parliamentary Question Nos 1 to 3 on today's Order Paper together, please?"
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00005,2023-11-07-T-001,5,Speaker,You do. Go ahead.
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00006,2023-11-07-T-001,6,Zaqy Mohamad,"I would like to assure Mr Saktiandi that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) closely tracks the number of resident workers across finer gross income bands, with special attention given to the progress of our lower-wage workers. But let me first talk more broadly about the wage outcomes before I come back to the income growth of lower-wage workers."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00007,2023-11-07-T-001,7,Zaqy Mohamad,"From 2017 to 2022, income growth has outpaced inflation, with the real median income growing by about 9.4% or 1.8% per annum. This income growth was commensurate with productivity growth, measured by real value-added per worker, of 2% per annum over the same period. However, due to the elevated inflation and weaker economic outlook, based on preliminary estimates, while nominal median income grew by 0.9%, real median income declined by 4.5% on a year-on-year basis in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we expect inflation to moderate for the rest of the year."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00008,2023-11-07-T-001,8,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Government recognises the impact of inflation on wages and has recently announced a $1.1 billion Cost of Living Support Package in September, which provides additional relief for all Singaporean households, with more support for lower- to middle-income families. In its recent announcement on 31 October, the National Wages Council (NWC) has called on employers to consider giving a one-off special lump sum payment to workers in recognition of the impact of high prices. The NWC Guidelines recommend that employers reward workers fairly based on their contributions and overall business performance, and adopt the Flexible Wage System in order to stay nimble and responsive amidst economic uncertainty."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00009,2023-11-07-T-001,9,Zaqy Mohamad,"To Mr Chia’s question, our strategy to sustain real income growth is to continue to raise productivity. This is why we have embarked on the 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to transform businesses and upskill workers for jobs of the future across the economy."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00010,2023-11-07-T-001,10,Zaqy Mohamad,"The NWC has also reiterated its call to employers to press on with transformation and upskilling to ensure that income growth is sustainable, and the Government will support such efforts. Employers can make use of the 16 Jobs Transformation Maps which provide actionable roadmaps to redesign jobs and upskill workers. Employers can also tap on programmes such as Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programmes, which provide up to 90% salary and course subsidies, to reskill their existing workers to take on enhanced job roles or train mid-career new hires to take on new roles. As indicated in the Forward Singapore report, we will launch new career health initiatives to improve job matching and help Singaporeans better plan for their long-term careers, through access to better data and information about jobs and skills. This will enhance employers’ access to talent and ensure better labour market outcomes."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00011,2023-11-07-T-001,11,Zaqy Mohamad,"I would like to assure Members that we pay special attention to our lower-wage workers. Mr Saktiandi and Mr Chia would be pleased to know that lower-wage workers have experienced good real income growth over the last five years. From 2017 to 2022, real income at the 20th percentile has risen 15.4%, or 2.9% per annum, faster than 1.8% per annum at the median. This means that as costs of living rose, the incomes of lower-wage workers rose even more, thereby narrowing the income gap between lower-wage workers and the median worker."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00012,2023-11-07-T-001,12,Zaqy Mohamad,"We have recently expanded the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to cover more lower-wage workers, and this will boost their incomes even further over the next few years – workers covered by PWM can expect cumulative wage increases of up to 80% by 2028. Amid a tight labour market, lower-wage workers who are not directly covered by PWM should also see meaningful wage increases, as employers will have to respond to market forces to attract and retain workers. To reduce the impact on employers, the Government co-funds up to 75% of wage increases given by employers to eligible lower-wage workers from 2022 to 2026, through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS). PWCS will soften the cost impact on employers in the near term, and give employers time to invest in upskilling workers and improving firm-level productivity so that the wage increases are sustainable."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00013,2023-11-07-T-001,13,Zaqy Mohamad,The Government also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme in January 2023 to further boost the income of lower-wage workers. We will be further enhancing Workfare as shared by Prime Minister Lee at the National Day Rally 2023 and details will be shared at next year’s Budget.
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00014,2023-11-07-T-001,14,Speaker,Mr Edward Chia.
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00015,2023-11-07-T-001,15,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State three supplementary questions. First, can he highlight sectors or jobs that are most at risk of wage stagnation or even worse, further deterioration in their wages? Second, what are the reasons for the elevated risks in these jobs or sectors? And third, what further support will the Government put in place to support employers in these sectors?"
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00016,2023-11-07-T-001,16,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his questions. Nominal wage growth for resident workers is expected to ease next year as labour demand cools and tightness in the labour market is alleviated. However, as overall wage growth is projected to moderate, it could remain elevated in several sectors."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00017,2023-11-07-T-001,17,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Member asked about the sectors. Wage increments are expected to stay firm in travel-related sectors where demand continues to recover, as well as more labour intensive services sectors where manpower shortages could be more persistent. So, we can roughly see the trends."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00018,2023-11-07-T-001,18,Zaqy Mohamad,"If we think about it, the decline in real income in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 was due to elevated inflation, rather than just wage decline. We have to look at real income in that context."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00019,2023-11-07-T-001,19,Zaqy Mohamad,"Overall, what we see is that the decline in real income was broad-based and not so much specific to certain sectors."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00020,2023-11-07-T-001,20,Zaqy Mohamad,"And in terms of the nominal income change, you would also see that across various sectors, the changes did not outpace inflation, and therefore, you see the decline in real incomes."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00021,2023-11-07-T-001,21,Zaqy Mohamad,"For the strategy to help businesses, we do need to support efforts to raise productivity. It goes beyond just increasing wages because there is impact on business costs. If productivity is not raised, you will find that businesses cannot sustain the wage increases. We have to look at that and balance both the impact of inflation and also look to see how we can improve productivity. At the same time, the Government does provide various measures to support business, for example, through the PWCS to reduce the impact of wage increases of lower-wage workers and other efforts such as productivity schemes. This is where we can work together in the next couple of years to improve wage outcomes, as a whole."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00022,2023-11-07-T-001,22,Zaqy Mohamad,"Do support us, do work with the Government in areas such as the Career Conversion Programmes for workers, Support for Job Redesign under Productivity Solutions Grant and the SkillsFuture credits. These are among the schemes that businesses can tap on."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00023,2023-11-07-T-001,23,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00024,2023-11-07-T-001,24,Saktiandi Supaat,"I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State two supplementary questions. First, the Senior Minister of State shared briefly about the median income growth outlook over the next year. Can he share a bit of it in the near term, for example, over the next five years, for example?"
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00025,2023-11-07-T-001,25,Saktiandi Supaat,"Second, given concerns of higher inflation over a longer time, if it does happen, can the Senior Minister of State share a bit more about the strategies for middle-income, lower middle-income and slightly upper middle-income workers? My question mentioned vulnerable groups of Singaporeans. And lower middle- and middle-income Singaporeans will eventually become vulnerable groups if they lose their job or fall sick. So, can the Senior Minister of State share a bit more on that, please?"
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00026,2023-11-07-T-001,26,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his questions. My crystal ball does not go that far. As I shared earlier, if we look at the trend for the rest of the year and if inflation moderates, that means the situation with the declines in real income will potentially moderate."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00027,2023-11-07-T-001,27,Zaqy Mohamad,"At the same time, let us not forget that in the last five years, we have seen good improvements with regard to real income. We have seen strong growth. As I shared, we had about 9.4% real income increase in the last five years, before the current decline and pressures of inflation. Therefore, we have to take some of these things into account."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00028,2023-11-07-T-001,28,Zaqy Mohamad,"Overall, in terms of how we can help our middle-income and lower middle-income workers improve, it is really through improvements in productivity, helping them benefit from the economic growth that we have, with new jobs, new growth sectors, as well as upskilling and reskilling in some of these new jobs where we can see higher productivity and better wage growth outcomes. The same goes for our lower-wage workers too today, where although they have the PWM, it is really about helping companies transform and redesign jobs so that we can sustain the wage increases. Otherwise, wage increases without corresponding productivity growth will be challenging, not just for the businesses but our economy as well."
2023-11-07-T-001-S-00029,2023-11-07-T-001,29,Zaqy Mohamad,"There are multiple layers. Economic restructuring has to continue. Firm-level productivity improvements have to continue as well. At the same time, at the worker level, you need skills and productivity improvements as well. I will take it at all three levels for us to sustain the wage growth in coming years."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00030,2023-11-07-T-002,30,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,asked the Minister for National Development in light of the decision by NParks to put down the saltwater crocodile found near Marina East Drive (a) what is the framework in place to decide on the appropriate strategy for urban wildlife management; and (b) what factors determine the relevant approach for different species of wildlife.
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00031,2023-11-07-T-002,31,Tan Kiat How,"Sir, as we transform Singapore into a City in Nature and bring people closer to nature, we will need to manage human-wildlife encounters carefully. This includes cultivating public awareness and appreciation, and weaving thoughtful biophilic designs into our urban spaces. At the same time, because we are a densely populated city-state, we will also need to ensure public health and safety."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00032,2023-11-07-T-002,32,Tan Kiat How,"To do so, the National Parks Board (NParks) takes a science- and community-based approach to wildlife management. NParks studies the population trends and distribution of various wildlife species across Singapore. The findings of these studies guide the development of NParks’ wildlife management strategies. NParks also consults local as well as wildlife experts to ensure that its strategies are in line with international practices and standards."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00033,2023-11-07-T-002,33,Tan Kiat How,"In managing different wildlife species, such as pest birds, long-tailed macaques, wild boars and crocodiles, NParks considers factors such as the species’ ecology and behaviour, threats to public health and safety, animal welfare, as well as impact on native biodiversity, habitats and the community."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00034,2023-11-07-T-002,34,Tan Kiat How,"Based on an assessment of these factors, a range of measures may be adopted. These include public education, enforcement against illegal wildlife feeding, habitat modification to reduce food sources and translocation of the animals away from urban areas. NParks may also need to take steps to safeguard public safety. For instance, it may put up signage to advise the public on how to respond to wildlife sightings. NParks may also install exclusion measures such as fencing, or carry out direct population control where necessary, such as in the case of wild boars."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00035,2023-11-07-T-002,35,Tan Kiat How,"In the case of estuarine crocodiles, like the one found near Marina East Drive, public safety is a major consideration as they are apex predators and stealthy, opportunistic feeders. They have attacked and killed children and adults in other countries. For example, on 23 October 2023, The Straits Times reported three suspected crocodile attacks in Sabah in the preceding month. To protect the public, the Sabah authorities had to cull five large crocodiles."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00036,2023-11-07-T-002,36,Tan Kiat How,"When there are sightings of crocodiles in Singapore, NParks will first assess if there is an immediate threat to public safety. For example, if the sighting is at a recreational destination, NParks will trap the crocodile and try to relocate or rehome it. In doing so, NParks takes into account the strong homing instinct of estuarine crocodiles to return to the location of capture. If there are no suitable options for relocation and rehoming, the crocodile will be humanely put down."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00037,2023-11-07-T-002,37,Tan Kiat How,"This approach is aligned with that taken in many other jurisdictions that have crocodiles or alligators, such as the city of Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory, where crocodiles are actively removed from areas of high human activity to reduce the likelihood of crocodile attacks. These crocodiles are either rehomed or put down."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00038,2023-11-07-T-002,38,Tan Kiat How,"The crocodile that the Member has mentioned was a large adult, measuring around three metres long. That is almost one and a half storeys high. It was sighted around two kilometres away from East Coast Park, which is about a 10-minute swim for a crocodile moving at stealth in the waters. As East Coast Park is a popular destination that receives 7.5 million visits a year, the assessment was that the crocodile posed a significant risk to public safety."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00039,2023-11-07-T-002,39,Tan Kiat How,"NParks first explored the option of relocating the crocodile to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but given the reserve’s large existing crocodile population of around 20 individuals, it no longer has the capacity for more crocodiles. In any case, moving the crocodile away from the Marina East beach would have risked it returning to the site, venturing to East Coast Park, or even straying into another area with high human activity along our coastline. If so, it would pose a substantial threat to public safety, given its large size and predatory nature."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00040,2023-11-07-T-002,40,Tan Kiat How,"NParks also reached out to the Mandai Wildlife Group (MWG). However, as MWG shared with The Straits Times, multiple factors are considered in zoo population management and planning. These include whether the outcome of a move would favour the animal in terms of quality of life and welfare, and possible negative effects on the zoo’s institutional population planning and conservation commitments. In this case, MWG determined that it would not be able to rehome the crocodile in a way that met these criteria."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00041,2023-11-07-T-002,41,Tan Kiat How,"As there was no feasible option for relocation or rehoming, NParks had to euthanise the crocodile in the interest of public safety. The decision was not taken lightly. The euthanasia was done by a veterinarian, in accordance with international standards."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00042,2023-11-07-T-002,42,Tan Kiat How,"NParks has also put in place other measures to mitigate the risks to public safety from Singapore’s wild crocodile population. For example, at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, NParks has installed fences to prevent crocodiles from getting onto footpaths. NParks has also installed signs to alert visitors to the presence of crocodiles and to advise them to remain calm and back away if they encounter a crocodile. In addition, NParks conducts regular population surveys of the reserve’s crocodiles and is exploring the use of technology to track their movements."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00043,2023-11-07-T-002,43,Tan Kiat How,"NParks agrees with Dr Shawn Lum, Senior Lecturer from the Nanyang Technological University and former President of the Nature Society (Singapore), who wrote an opinion piece in The Straits Times on 27 October 2023, and I quote him  ""We need both a system and a culture for dealing with the joys and risks that come with having beautiful and majestic wild neighbours."""
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00044,2023-11-07-T-002,44,Tan Kiat How,"To this end, NParks will continue to monitor and carefully manage the populations of local wildlife species to safeguard public health and safety. NParks will also deepen its collaborations with partners such as the nature community and youth leaders from the Youth Stewards for Nature programme, to promote safe and responsible human-wildlife encounters in our City in Nature."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00045,2023-11-07-T-002,45,Speaker,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00046,2023-11-07-T-002,46,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Thank you, Speaker, and I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have three follow-up supplementary questions, bearing in mind the more long-term protection and solution to this. Really, the intention is to understand the structured approach."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00047,2023-11-07-T-002,47,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"First, experts mentioned that there are very few studies to understand the behaviour of crocodiles, especially locally. Is that something that we are looking more into doing?"
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00048,2023-11-07-T-002,48,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Second, thank you for sharing the steps which NParks took. Were other stakeholders consulted during this process? For example, animal welfare groups (AWGs) and things like that."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00049,2023-11-07-T-002,49,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The third question is, are groups such as Our Wild Neighbours looking to do more to bring more awareness about such animals so beyond, for example, otters and macaques? Are we also looking into doing more for crocodiles as well as tapirs which we had recently seen in September as well?"
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00050,2023-11-07-T-002,50,Tan Kiat How,"Sir, to the Member's first question, NParks conducts regular ecological studies on the behaviour, habitats and trends of the local flora and fauna population. So, it is not just specific to crocodiles or specific animals – we do it on a large scale."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00051,2023-11-07-T-002,51,Tan Kiat How,"Importantly, we also regularly consult experts from overseas. I mentioned the Northern Territory of Australia. We consult them regularly as part of our effort in Singapore, because they have much more experience dealing with crocodiles in their part of the world. We adopt best practices from jurisdictions like the Northern Territory as well as other parts of the world. And we do consult AWGs regularly."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00052,2023-11-07-T-002,52,Tan Kiat How,"In the case of this crocodile, we had to move rather quickly. Once it was sighted, we had to quickly trap it to make sure that the area was safe for the public. But we actively reached out and explored various options to rehome or relocate the crocodile. So, we will continue to engage our stakeholder groups in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00053,2023-11-07-T-002,53,Tan Kiat How,"And to the Member’s last question, on public education. Yes, we will continue to do more."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00054,2023-11-07-T-002,54,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00055,2023-11-07-T-002,55,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. I thank Senior Minister of State for the reply. I understand that we had to move quickly in terms of public safety, but could I ask whether the framework that the Senior Minister of State has just shared in this House can be put through a consultation with all the animal welfare groups and nature groups, the youth leaders that he talked about, so that there can be consensus in how we move forward in future cases where there are human-wildlife conflict again?"
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00056,2023-11-07-T-002,56,Tan Kiat How,"Sir, we regularly engage stakeholder groups, animal welfare groups and experts, and share our considerations. So, the framework is not something that is new or unfamiliar to many of our stakeholder groups. It is based on community inputs and, importantly, based on science. We assess what needs to be done based on internationally informed scientific evidence and how to customise it to our context."
2023-11-07-T-002-S-00057,2023-11-07-T-002,57,Tan Kiat How,"So, we will continue to engage. And we welcome inputs from stakeholders on how we should deal with wildlife encounters along the way."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00058,2023-11-07-T-003,58,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the Ministry’s approach towards the housing of transgender persons in prison settings in Singapore, having regard to the recent situation in Scotland where a transgender person, convicted of double rape of women, was initially housed in segregation in an all-female jail."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00059,2023-11-07-T-003,59,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the case that Mr Murali refers to involved a Scottish male sex offender called Isla Bryson. Isla Bryson was undergoing hormonal treatment at the time of his conviction to transition to a female."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00060,2023-11-07-T-003,60,K Shanmugam,"In January of this year, 2023, Bryson was convicted of raping two women. At the time of conviction, Bryson’s self-identified gender was female. However, his registered sex was male and he still had male genitalia. Bryson was remanded in a women’s prison while awaiting his sentence. That was done based on the Scottish Prison Services' policy, which determines housing arrangements based on an inmate's ""new gender""."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00061,2023-11-07-T-003,61,K Shanmugam,"The prospect of a convicted male rapist serving a sentence in a women's prison sparked public debate and concerns about the safety of the other prisoners. In response, Bryson was moved to a male prison facility."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00062,2023-11-07-T-003,62,K Shanmugam,"In Singapore, our primary consideration is the safety of the inmates."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00063,2023-11-07-T-003,63,K Shanmugam,"As a rule, inmates are housed in a male or female institution based on their registered sex, and not their self-identified gender. There may be situations, however, where it may be better not to house an inmate with other inmates of their registered sex for consideration of safety, either for the safety of the inmate or the safety of the other inmates."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00064,2023-11-07-T-003,64,K Shanmugam,"For example, for a male inmate who is transitioning and who has developed female features, such as breasts, it may not be completely safe for this inmate to be housed together with other male inmates. On the other hand, inmates in a female institution may not feel comfortable if we house with them, a former male who has just completed transitioning to be a female, especially if, like in the case of Bryson, the person had previously committed sexual offences. So, in such cases, we may house them alone in individual cells within the institution of their registered sex, or in a shared cell with other inmates who are in the same situation."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00065,2023-11-07-T-003,65,K Shanmugam,"There may also be situations where inmates, during medical examination upon admission, are found to have external genitalia different from their registered sex. In such cases, Prisons may first house them alone in individual cells in the institution of their registered sex. Prisons will then facilitate an examination by a medical specialist to assess if they have had a complete physical change in genitalia, and if so, will assist the inmate to update their registered sex with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). This follows ICA’s requirements that a person’s sex change must first be verified by a local relevant medical specialist before ICA updates the registered sex of the person in its database."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00066,2023-11-07-T-003,66,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00067,2023-11-07-T-003,67,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note the nuanced approach in dealing with the transgender prisoners. I have two supplementary questions."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00068,2023-11-07-T-003,68,Murali Pillai,"First, may I ask the hon Minister for Home Affairs whether there have been any instances of transgender persons being assaulted, particularly sexually assaulted in our Singapore Prisons and what steps have been taken to deal with that?"
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00069,2023-11-07-T-003,69,Murali Pillai,"And secondly, I wonder whether there is a regime put in place by the Singapore Prisons Service where transgender persons are regularly interviewed to see how they are faring so that we can make sure that they are safe in the prison environment?"
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00070,2023-11-07-T-003,70,K Shanmugam,"I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. On the first, if he wants specific data, he can file a question and we can answer. In general, the level of violence in our Prisons is very low, both because of pre-emptive measures and the discipline in the Prisons – fairly tight control is exercised. So, I would be surprised if there were many such instances. But if he wants specific data, he can file it. It is certainly not something that has come up in a serious way as an issue for a policy decision. And Members can see how we take an approach which is slightly different from the approach, for example, in the Isla Bryson's case. I would say ours is a very practical approach."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00071,2023-11-07-T-003,71,K Shanmugam,"On the second question, if you can remind me."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00072,2023-11-07-T-003,72,Murali Pillai,"Sir, it is about whether the Prisons have a institutional practice of reaching out to transgender —"
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00073,2023-11-07-T-003,73,K Shanmugam,"Yes, okay. Not just for transgender persons but all inmates – there is an approach as part of the rehabilitation process – where counsellors are available, and prisoners are interviewed regularly and spoken with, and where inmates are able to raise the issues they have and they will be considered. Of course, not all requests and concerns would be considered as legitimate. Legitimate issues would be dealt with."
2023-11-07-T-003-S-00074,2023-11-07-T-003,74,Speaker,"Mr Pillai, next question."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00075,2023-11-07-T-004,75,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Law (a) whether an update can be provided on the cases undertaken by the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) since it commenced operations on 1 December 2022; and (b) how does the PDO deal with cases involving alleged crimes that may be viewed by the public as being morally repugnant in assessing whether to provide legal aid.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00076,2023-11-07-T-004,76,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, my reply will also address written Question No 10 in the Order Paper for today’s Sitting."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00077,2023-11-07-T-004,77,K Shanmugam,"The Public Defender’s Office (PDO) was set up in December of 2022. So, we are now about 12 months into it. It is to provide criminal defence aid to persons facing non-capital charges and who cannot afford a lawyer. As of September 2023, the PDO has taken up 303 cases from applicants and has taken these to Court."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00078,2023-11-07-T-004,78,K Shanmugam,"Eligible applicants receive representation from either the PDO or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). With this co-delivery model, CLAS’ annual case load in 2023 is expected to be lower than in 2022. Nonetheless, this has only been nine to 10 months, and we have to continue to monitor the situation."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00079,2023-11-07-T-004,79,K Shanmugam,"Some of the applicants for criminal defence aid face charges for minor offences, like shop theft, mischief and so on. But some others face more serious, non-capital charges – unlicensed moneylending, drug trafficking or sexual assault against vulnerable victims and so on."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00080,2023-11-07-T-004,80,K Shanmugam,"We have to ensure that aid is rendered to those who are deserving and each application for criminal defence aid is subjected to means and merits tests. The means test, in terms of economic means; and the merits test, in terms of having some basis for defence."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00081,2023-11-07-T-004,81,K Shanmugam,The precise framework is set out. I am not seeking to set that out; I am using short-hand terms here.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00082,2023-11-07-T-004,82,K Shanmugam,"These assessments are not based on the nature of the alleged offences or the moral reprehensibility of the applicant. The means test, as I said earlier, is to ensure that aid is given to those who are unable to afford legal fees. The merits test assesses whether the applicant will benefit from legal representation or has reasonable grounds to defend or appeal his case in Court."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00083,2023-11-07-T-004,83,K Shanmugam,"Sometimes, the PDO comes across cases, which many would consider to be highly represensible. It can relate to sexual assault, child abuse or family violence. The nature of the crime can cause public outrage or concern. But the PDO cannot refuse to handle these cases. That is not the test. The test is not one of moral reprehensibility. The test is whether the person qualifies under the means test and the merits test. It has to handle the cases, as long as they are assessed to have some legal merit."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00084,2023-11-07-T-004,84,K Shanmugam,"One example is a recent Court of Appeal matter involving an accused person who pleaded guilty to sexually penetrating his own younger sister. I think almost all right-thinking members of society would say that it is completely unacceptable, reprehensible. He had committed the offences when he was between the age of 15 and 17 years. He was initially sentenced to 18 years in prison and 16 strokes of the cane. He applied to PDO for aid to appeal against his sentence. Aid was granted as he had fulfilled the means test criteria and PDO assessed that there was merit to the appeal on the ground that the sentence given by the lower Court was excessive. The Court of Appeal agreed and his sentence was reduced by two years."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00085,2023-11-07-T-004,85,K Shanmugam,This scenario sometimes arises in other jurisdictions as well. You have the case of Police Constable Andrew Harper in the United Kingdom. A uniformed officer gave chase to a group of teenagers who were trying to escape after stealing a bike. He was dragged by the car which was driven by one of the teenagers and he died. There was widespread public sympathy for him and outrage over the fact that he died. The three teenagers received legal aid. The Court found them guilty of manslaughter instead of murder.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00086,2023-11-07-T-004,86,K Shanmugam,"In another case in New Zealand, a family of five was mass murdered, and David Bain, who was the only survivor, was accused of the murder. There were mixed views over his innocence. This case has been described as, and I quote, ""the most widely discussed and divisive in New Zealand's criminal history"". After 13 years, he was acquitted of all charges. Without legal aid, he might have remained behind bars until today."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00087,2023-11-07-T-004,87,K Shanmugam,"As I explained in my Ministerial Statement in April last year, the provision of legal aid cannot depend on public outrage against the alleged offender or sympathy for the victim. With the PDO, we will assess each case based on its own merit, and those who have a meritorious case but cannot afford a lawyer will be provided access to legal advice and representation to defend their case in court. This is how we can try to ensure that access to justice is available to more."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00088,2023-11-07-T-004,88,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00089,2023-11-07-T-004,89,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note from the hon Minister for Law's response that PDO has employed a principled stance in defending accused who have been accused of committing morally reprehensible offences. This is actually in line with the ethos of lawyers in the Criminal Bar. I recall the words of the late Mr Subhas Anandan, known as one of the doyens in the Criminal Bar, and he said that everybody deserves a fair trial, including those who have been accused of committing heinous crimes."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00090,2023-11-07-T-004,90,Murali Pillai,"Sir, my question is in relation to the dealings of the PDO officers with such persons. Sometimes, PDO officers may deal with requests on the part of such accused person to put certain lines of questions to vulnerable victims. And PDO officers, based on their assessment, they may not want to take up such lines. For example, cross-examining a vulnerable victim in relation to the person's sexual background and so on."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00091,2023-11-07-T-004,91,Murali Pillai,"How do we protect PDO officers in these circumstances? Because what we do not want also, is to have an allegation made against such a PDO officer and he has to deal with it in the disciplinary setting."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00092,2023-11-07-T-004,92,K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. I would say the framework of the law is clear. What you can ask, what you cannot ask in cross-examination, lawyers will know. The PDO is led by a very senior lawyer who will give guidance to the more junior lawyers. And ultimately in Court, there is the prosecution and there is the Court, which controls proceedings."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00093,2023-11-07-T-004,93,K Shanmugam,"I think the line to be crossed in terms of misconduct, is quite far; there are a number of safeguards. I do not believe that our PDO officers feel that they have to pull back from proper questioning, or be particularly concerned that questions they ask will be considered beyond the pale, in terms of correct and proper discharge of a lawyer's duties in court."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00094,2023-11-07-T-004,94,K Shanmugam,"But, in any event, I will pass on the Member's feedback to the Chief Public Defender."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00095,2023-11-07-T-004,95,Speaker,Mr Pillai.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00096,2023-11-07-T-004,96,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just clarify, my concern was less in relation to the PDO officer being able to discharge his duties in cross-examination, more in relation to him refraining from taking the instructions from the accused in putting certain positions during cross-examination and that may lend him in an invidious position, when after the fact, the accused who may then be convicted, saying that he has not been given a fair defence. That is the point I was trying to raise."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00097,2023-11-07-T-004,97,K Shanmugam,"I think the answer to that is  it is a situation faced by all lawyers who practise. What do you think is the right defence or the right case to put forward? What is relevant? What is not relevant? These are assessments and it depends on training and skill. By and large, the Legal Service gets very good officers who apply to join. PDO gets very committed officers and it depends on training."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00098,2023-11-07-T-004,98,K Shanmugam,"I think the whole approach for PDO officers and AGC officers, the prosecution  you do your duty without fear or favour."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00099,2023-11-07-T-004,99,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00100,2023-11-07-T-004,100,He Ting Ru,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Minister for Law on the response to my written question about the effect on CLAS. We look forward to receiving more detailed data about the actual effect on it. I note earlier that the Minister said that the amount that CLAS handles this year is expected to be lower, because of the coming on stream of the PDO."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00101,2023-11-07-T-004,101,He Ting Ru,"Moving on to the means and merit test, I think we are in broad alignment of the principles used to decide whether or not the PDO will take on the cases. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. The first being, whether the Minister can share a little bit of data about the capacity of the PDO, whether what levels of capacity it is operating at, given that this is a new office? And secondly, whether the Minister can give a breakdown about the cases that the PDO has rejected to take on because they did not satisfy the means test or the merits test, based on the number of applications received?"
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00102,2023-11-07-T-004,102,K Shanmugam,"On the capacity, it is chicken and egg. I mean, it depends on how many cases come up. At present, there is a certain pathway where PDO is intended to build up from last year, based on our assessment of the number of cases that are likely to come up, bearing in mind that we really do not want to go in to territory where lawyers are providing services."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00103,2023-11-07-T-004,103,K Shanmugam,"We want to meet the demand, where the clients today, either by themselves or through their family, are unable to pay for lawyers to represent them. Because this is taxpayers' money and it has got to be used judiciously. I have made that point before several times. There are a number of countries which have gone down this route and then find that they are unable to afford it. If people can afford it, they should go and pay for it."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00104,2023-11-07-T-004,104,K Shanmugam,"Precisely how many cases we will take up, it is subject to how many cases apply. Today, we are not beyond our capacity and we will build up a little bit more as the case load increases. It is a balance between the well-known manpower shortage all across Singapore, including in the legal industry. The fact is that, as a result of our new approach taken a few years ago to drugs, where we no longer prosecute a drug abuser as a criminal, but send such a person to rehabilitation, that has removed a lot of cases from the criminal justice system. Because these people are now in rehabilitation and then, they are released. Even if they come back for the third time or a fourth time, as long as they only abuse drugs and they have not committed any other offence, they are no longer charged. So, the number of criminal cases have come down quite substantially."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00105,2023-11-07-T-004,105,K Shanmugam,We are a low-crime society. Crimes like these have been redefined as we take a rehabilitation approach.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00106,2023-11-07-T-004,106,K Shanmugam,"With all that, we will look at it. If the number of cases go up, we will employ more people. Or if we cannot, we will explain that this is our capacity and this is what we are prepared to spend. Then, it is up to Parliament to say, ""We think you ought to spend more of taxpayers' money."" We will come and discuss that, as necessary."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00107,2023-11-07-T-004,107,K Shanmugam,"In terms of the data on the types of cases which have been rejected, what I can say to the Member is that, they have been rejected not because of capacity but because they do not meet our means or merits test. If the Member wants more data on that, she can file a question and we will look it up and answer it. But no case has been turned away because we said we do not have the capacity."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00108,2023-11-07-T-004,108,Speaker,Ms He.
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00109,2023-11-07-T-004,109,He Ting Ru,"Sorry, just a quick clarification. I was not suggesting that it was because of capacity. There were actually two separate issues. Given that this is a new office, I am just curious about whether we have had overcapacity? And what are the anticipated cases, what we budgeted for and also what eventually came to pass over the last 11 to 12 months?"
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00110,2023-11-07-T-004,110,He Ting Ru,"The second point was about the two means and merits testing, the two broad categories that the Minister mentioned earlier. I just wanted to know, as a separate issue, how many cases were actually rejected because of it? Just to clarify this point."
2023-11-07-T-004-S-00111,2023-11-07-T-004,111,K Shanmugam,"I can look it up. If the Member files a question, I can look it up and say how many cases did not qualify under the means or merits test. If I am not wrong, I think I have given the numbers that we will build up to. This year, we have about 25 officers or so, plus minus, and we can build up as necessary. We have budgeted for building up."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00112,2023-11-07-T-005,112,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) since 2021, how many Singaporeans have successfully applied for MediFund at one healthcare institution and have at least an annual appointment at another healthcare institution (i) within the same cluster and (ii) in a different cluster respectively; (b) how many of such patients have successfully applied for MediFund across all healthcare clusters they have been to; and (c) whether the MediFund application process can be streamlined to support needy Singaporeans who cannot afford their healthcare bills across different healthcare institutions."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00113,2023-11-07-T-005,113,Ong Ye Kung,"Sir, around 30% of the MediFund beneficiaries received MediFund assistance from more than one institution within the same public healthcare cluster, and around 40% received MediFund assistance from more than one institution across public healthcare clusters. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has devolved MediFund approvals to the MediFund Committees of individual healthcare institutions. This is to enable the Committees to exercise greater discretion in assessing MediFund applications and, thereby, improving their accessibility to these funds. However, this also inevitably leads to multiple assessments for the same patients across institutions  you transfer from acute hospital to community hospital, you go through one more round of assessment, and that adds to their inconvenience."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00114,2023-11-07-T-005,114,Ong Ye Kung,"We need to strike a balance between these two objectives of flexibility and convenience. In line with that, MOH has reviewed the MediFund application process to make it more seamless with limited impact on the flexibility and discretion of the MediFund Committees. And we will be implementing the following changes by March 2024."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00115,2023-11-07-T-005,115,Ong Ye Kung,"First, a mutual recognition arrangement between acute hospital and step-down care. This means that when a patient benefiting from MediFund is transferred from an acute hospital to step-down care, he or she will continue to benefit from MediFund without having to re-apply again. As the medical bills, social and financial circumstances of patients may vary over time as they transfer from one institution to another, this automatic extension of MediFund will be for three months or until the receiving institution reassesses the patient’s eligibility for continued MediFund assistance."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00116,2023-11-07-T-005,116,Ong Ye Kung,"The second change is a mutual recognition arrangement within the same healthcare cluster for outpatient treatment. For example, if a patient is receiving MediFund at an outpatient institution, say, a polyclinic, and he goes to another MediFund institution within the same healthcare cluster, say, a specialist at a Specialised Outpatient Clinic, he will automatically receive support from MediFund and does not need to re-apply for his outpatient bills another time. This automatic support will be valid for a year from the time MediFund is first extended to him at the outpatient setting."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00117,2023-11-07-T-005,117,Ong Ye Kung,"Last, more support for ComCare graduates. Today, MediFund assistance is automatically extended to needy patients who are under ComCare assistance. MediFund assistance is withdrawn when the patients graduate from the ComCare scheme. So, there is a bit of a cliff effect. So, to strengthen support for these ComCare graduates on their journey to self-reliance, MediFund support will continue for three months after graduation from ComCare."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00118,2023-11-07-T-005,118,Ong Ye Kung,"I should clarify that under the law, MediFund Committees of each healthcare institution continue to have full discretion over the application outcome and extent of support, to prioritise support towards those who need it the most. Notwithstanding, MOH has been engaging them to agree to support the changes that I just mentioned. MOH will be issuing these guidelines to the MediFund Committees. These enhancements should help smoothen the experience for MediFund beneficiaries as they transfer or seek care in different healthcare settings, and we expect them to come into force by March 2024."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00119,2023-11-07-T-005,119,Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00120,2023-11-07-T-005,120,Tan Wu Meng,I thank the Minister for his answer. I declare that I am a medical doctor at a public healthcare institution.
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00121,2023-11-07-T-005,121,Tan Wu Meng,"Eleven years ago, a number of young healthcare workers, including myself and others, had advocated for such improvements within the same healthcare institution campus. In 2016, seven years ago, I had asked a Parliamentary Question on how we could smoothen that journey across different hospitals across Singapore. These are welcome developments, and I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00122,2023-11-07-T-005,122,Tan Wu Meng,"Firstly, we have some elderly residents who are less mobile and who are worried about having to make additional appointments to see a medical social worker, whether it is for review or renewal of their support. A less-mobile resident who needs a caregiver to accompany, this has implications for the caregiver, too. Can I ask the Minister, are there ways we can better resource our medical social worker (MSW) departments so that more patients can have the assessment and review with an MSW on the same day that they come to the clinic or for treatment at the hospital?"
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00123,2023-11-07-T-005,123,Tan Wu Meng,"Secondly, can I also ask the Minister, given there are some patients who have great difficulty getting out of the home, would MOH consider working with either the SSOs or the local family service centres to help engage local teams who might be able to visit a less-mobile patient at home, so that the patient does not have to go and make an additional trip purely for the purpose of means testing?"
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00124,2023-11-07-T-005,124,Ong Ye Kung,I thank the Member for asking all these questions on behalf of your Clementi residents. [
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00125,2023-11-07-T-005,125,Ong Ye Kung,"Like all policies, it takes time for us to look at it and find ways to implement it in a way that everyone can accept. So, I think persistence does pay off and I know Dr Tan has also been equally persistent in asking for the elderly who are immobile, in terms of the portability of their subsidy as well of their MediFund eligibility."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00126,2023-11-07-T-005,126,Ong Ye Kung,"These are valid suggestions. We will have to look at them. One way is to go digital and make things easier, but that also introduces its own impediments. But it will be a useful channel for the immobile or home-bound patients to also apply for medical and financial assistance."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00127,2023-11-07-T-005,127,Ong Ye Kung,"The other is that we have now implemented Healthier SG and also Age Well SG with a whole network of active ageing centres (AACs) throughout our communities. We want to double the number, expand the network, deepen the kind of help they can extend to our aged residents. So, they can also be a channel from which I would not rule out that, in time to come, they can also be a channel for us to guide our aged and seniors to apply for assistance there."
2023-11-07-T-005-S-00128,2023-11-07-T-005,128,Ong Ye Kung,"So, these are all the possibilities. We will take them in. Persistence does help. So, keep on putting forward such suggestions to us."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00129,2023-11-07-T-006,129,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the projected impact on Singapore’s seaports of Thailand’s project to build two deep seaports with a rail and road system to link access between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand; and (b) how can the competitiveness of Singapore’s seaports be further boosted to maintain their contribution to Singapore’s economy.
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00130,2023-11-07-T-006,130,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Transport what is the likely impact of Thailand’s proposed land bridge project on Singapore’s status and competitiveness as a global seaport.
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00131,2023-11-07-T-006,131,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 8 and 9 on today's Order Paper?"
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00132,2023-11-07-T-006,132,Speaker,Please proceed.
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00133,2023-11-07-T-006,133,Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you. Sir, my reply will also address written Question No 14 by Miss Cheryl Chan for today's Sitting."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00134,2023-11-07-T-006,134,Chee Hong Tat,"A land bridge in Thailand could shorten the travelling time for some vessels by a few days, compared with sailing through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The exact time saving will depend on many factors, such as the time needed to unload the cargo from the vessel, then transport it across the land bridge and load onto the vessel at the other end. These would likely incur additional expenses for shipping companies. So, they need to consider the overall costs versus the benefits, compared to sailing through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00135,2023-11-07-T-006,135,Chee Hong Tat,"Singapore will continue to focus on enhancing our port's connectivity, productivity and competitiveness. This includes the use of technology to make port calls more efficient and working with industry to catalyse the development and availability of cleaner bunkering fuels. The development of Tuas Port will also allow us to accommodate mega container ships, providing shipping companies with the necessary capacity and connectivity to meet their future needs."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00136,2023-11-07-T-006,136,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi.
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00137,2023-11-07-T-006,137,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. I would just like to seek clarification and also his views. In terms of relationships between countries, for example, between Thailand and the neighbouring countries within ASEAN, has this sort of deliberation been discussed and, in terms of ASEAN transport-to-transport ministries, whether such deliberations have actually emerged and discussions started on this issue?"
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00138,2023-11-07-T-006,138,Saktiandi Supaat,"Second, with regard to the worst-case scenario, if this does go ahead in the southern part of Thailand and into the Andaman Sea and the rail-and-road like what the Minister mentioned, the ramifications on Singapore's hub status as a seaport does get affected. In the worst-case scenario, will it be a total 100%, the feel from the MOT perspective, and what is the impact as well? I think the Minister mentioned just now, but what would be the worst-case scenario?"
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00139,2023-11-07-T-006,139,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I think we recognise that when it comes to port operations, this is a global industry and, therefore, he nature of the competition is also global. We cannot prevent others from enhancing their port facilities, their infrastructure, whether it is the land bridge that I addressed in my reply to the questions or some other type of infrastructure enhancements as well as building new capabilities. So, therefore, the key for us is really to focus on how we, the Port of Singapore, can stay competitive and relevant."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00140,2023-11-07-T-006,140,Chee Hong Tat,"And there are a few elements here. First, of course, is productivity. So, we are investing heavily in technology to raise the productivity of our port operations, working very closely with the port operators, and also with our unions and workers."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00141,2023-11-07-T-006,141,Chee Hong Tat,"Second, is to look at how we can coordinate better with our shipping lines so that they arrive without waiting too long in our ports, and that when they arrive in our ports, they are able to get good services from a whole suite of services that they will require – bunkering, supplies – not just to load and offload cargo."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00142,2023-11-07-T-006,142,Chee Hong Tat,"Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if we look at port operations, it is a network effect that we have to protect. So, the connectivity of our port is the most crucial. And there is a network effect because the more people call at a particular hub, the more value there is to others in a network."
2023-11-07-T-006-S-00143,2023-11-07-T-006,143,Chee Hong Tat,"So, therefore, we must always safeguard our competitiveness, connectivity and productivity."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00144,2023-11-07-T-007,144,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Prime Minister regarding the Shared Responsibility Framework that was jointly proposed by MAS and IMDA on 25 October 2023, how does the ""waterfall approach"" on losses arising from phishing scams adequately safeguard consumers' interests."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00145,2023-11-07-T-007,145,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Prime Minister whether the proposed framework for equitable sharing of losses between scam victims and financial institutions will consider (i) the better protection of some elderly scam victims through the use of physical hardware tokens for two-factor authentication rather than digital tokens and (ii) the number of elderly banking customers who have limited digital literacy and are placed in a potentially invidious position when their bank phased out the use of physical hardware tokens.
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00146,2023-11-07-T-007,146,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 10 and 11 in today's Order Paper, as well as Written Question Nos and 5 in today's Order Paper, filed by Ms Sylvia Lim, together, as they relate to the proposed Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF)?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00147,2023-11-07-T-007,147,Speaker,Please proceed.
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00148,2023-11-07-T-007,148,Alvin Tan,"The SRF prescribes a set of anti-scam duties for financial institutions (FIs) and telecommunication companies (telcos) and provides for payouts to victims of phishing scams when these duties are breached. Under SRF, the FI stands at the top of this waterfall. If the FI does not fulfil any of its four anti-scam duties, it will compensate the scam victim fully for the loss suffered, regardless of whether the telco has discharged its duties or the victim has taken the necessary precautions. Likewise, if the FI has fulfilled its duties but the telco has not, then the telco is expected to bear full responsibility for the loss. Only if both the FI and telco have discharged their duties fully, will the customer, who stands at the bottom of the waterfall, have to bear the loss."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00149,2023-11-07-T-007,149,Alvin Tan,"This approach recognises the key roles of FIs and telcos in preventing scams, and also reflects the SRF’s policy intent of strengthening their direct accountability to consumers. It incentivises FIs and telcos to strictly uphold the desired standards of anti-scam controls."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00150,2023-11-07-T-007,150,Alvin Tan,"The duties defined for FIs in the SRF are built on a broader suite of measures that major retail banks are implementing to strengthen the security of digital banking in Singapore. Based on data collected by the Police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimates there were about 15,000 phishing scam cases from 2021 to mid-2023, with an average loss per case of about S$3,900. We do not have data on the number of phishing scams that involve potential breaches of duties by FIs, but such data will be tracked under the SRF going forward."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00151,2023-11-07-T-007,151,Alvin Tan,"Besides assigning accountability for scam losses, the important point is that full implementation by FIs and telcos of their respective safeguards should materially reduce the risk of phishing scams in this first instance. As it stands today, the number of phishing scams has continued to rise in the first half of this year compared to the previous period, but has declined as a proportion of total scam cases from 17% to 13%. The average loss per phishing scam has also declined by 20% over the same period. The Government will continue to monitor this closely. We are all committed to stem this rising tide of scams and losses."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00152,2023-11-07-T-007,152,Alvin Tan,"Dr Tan Wu Meng had asked if the SRF would consider seniors with limited digital literacy when their bank phased out the use of physical hardware tokens. The retail banks already offer physical tokens for customers who request for them. Separate from the SRF, MAS has asked the banks to assess and implement customer authentication mechanisms that are more resistant to both phishing and malware attacks. When these measures are well developed, we can consider them for inclusion into the SRF."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00153,2023-11-07-T-007,153,Alvin Tan,"Sir, we should see the SRF as part of broader suite of measures that the Government, the banks and other ecosystem players have progressively implemented to tackle the scourge of scams in Singapore. I covered these measures extensively in my response to the Adjournment Motion filed by Ms Lim in September. The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) released a media statement on 24 October 2023 outlining banks' efforts to protect consumers against scams, including through anti-scam measures and also raising consumer awareness."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00154,2023-11-07-T-007,154,Alvin Tan,"But SRF is not the only means through which scam victims can seek assistance. As ABS announced, banks have discretionary goodwill payment frameworks for their scam victims beyond the SRF. Depending on the circumstances of each scam case, the sophistication of the scam typology and the consumer's financial situation, banks have covered part or all of the losses incurred by scam victims."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00155,2023-11-07-T-007,155,Alvin Tan,"MAS has leaned on the banks to be even more accommodative in applying their goodwill payment frameworks. These goodwill frameworks complement the SRF, which is intended to strengthen the accountability of FIs and telcos to consumers when they have breached their defined duties."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00156,2023-11-07-T-007,156,Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00157,2023-11-07-T-007,157,Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Speaker. I have three supplementary questions for the Minister of State. The waterfall approach that is described in the paper, of course, MAS acknowledges that it is actually quite drastically different from the approach being taken in the United Kingdom (UK), where there is going to be a default requirement for banks to compensate customers, unless the customer was fraudulent or grossly negligent."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00158,2023-11-07-T-007,158,Sylvia Lim,"I wonder if he will agree with me that the waterfall approach can actually be seen as giving the banks a free pass, if they are able to tick the four boxes. That means to say, if they fulfil the four prescribed duties that are in the paper, they will not have to bear any losses, and based on the case studies in the paper, it appears to be so. So, I wonder whether he will agree with me that, in effect, this is what the waterfall approach will end up achieving for the banks."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00159,2023-11-07-T-007,159,Sylvia Lim,"The second question is  he mentioned that the four obligations set out in the paper are already being implemented by the banks. I do not know whether fully or progressively. So, how different is it really from the current status of the banks fulfilling these duties, and is the Government concerned that many scam victims will remain uncompensated under the SRF framework?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00160,2023-11-07-T-007,160,Sylvia Lim,"Thirdly, on the question of physical tokens, I have a Parliamentary Question No 44 on this topic, but I do not know why it was not grouped together. He mentioned that customers can request for physical tokens from the banks. I have received many emails from the public to say that this is not offered by their banks, they were told that it has been phased out."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00161,2023-11-07-T-007,161,Sylvia Lim,"And I myself went to a local bank to request a hardware token. It was not easy. I was first told that it is not going to be issued. And then, I had to insist and special approval was then obtained from the branch manager to issue the token to me. I was also warned that it might be phased out in due course and they cannot assure me that this service would be available. So, I wonder whether the Minister of State is aware of this as well."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00162,2023-11-07-T-007,162,Alvin Tan,"I thank Ms Sylvia Lim. In fact, I want to thank Ms Sylvia Lim and Dr Tan Wu Meng for constantly working on this, together with MAS as well as the Government. I think it is an issue which we are incredibly concerned about and we are taking action."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00163,2023-11-07-T-007,163,Alvin Tan,"If the Member might indulge me, I will first answer the third question. Thank you for that feedback. What we can do and what we will ask the banks to do in terms of the request for tokens, is to make it easier. So, we take that feedback and we will put it back through MAS as well as the banks to ensure that customers who require physical tokens and are going to the banks to request for physical tokens, that process is made easier, particularly if they are not as adept or they do not yet have that confidence with digital tokens. I think that is a very important point, so, thank you for making that point. We will look into it and we will ask the banks to smoothen this process out."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00164,2023-11-07-T-007,164,Alvin Tan,"The Member then also had two questions, with regard to the waterfall approach, as well as whether the banks are already fulfilling duties. Given that the Member had talked about the approach by the UK, maybe I can draw a distinction between what the UK is doing and what we are doing. There are, of course, variations between the UK's approach, as well as our approach, and let me go into detail why we have taken this approach."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00165,2023-11-07-T-007,165,Alvin Tan,"First, the recent moves by the UK and Australia are not the norm globally; and, in fact, these approaches will evolve over time. Singapore, like many jurisdictions, has adopted a slightly different approach on scams that are involving authorised transactions. Authorised transactions are scams, such as love, investment and job scams, for which the customer has authorised the transactions. If you think about the pre-digital banking days, the victims of such scams would have effectively just handed over cash, or written a cheque to these scammers promising a job or an investment return. Now, they are making these transactions through digital means."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00166,2023-11-07-T-007,166,Alvin Tan,"It is challenging for a bank or telco if the SRF were to cover such scams – it would have to extend to all manner of deceptions, where victims are tricked into willingly handing over their money. That is why for scams involving authorised transactions, in this case, the best approach – and, in fact, we are raising this awareness – is for customers to exercise utmost vigilance and take personal responsibility. Therefore, we also stepping up public education efforts, including constant public advisories."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00167,2023-11-07-T-007,167,Alvin Tan,"But as we had discussed in the Adjournment Motion, we also want to guard against the moral hazard risk, in terms of consumers letting their guard down and potentially also working in cahoots with scammers to defraud the banks."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00168,2023-11-07-T-007,168,Alvin Tan,"Both the Member and I have heard feedback, even from the general public, that it would not be fair for the FIs, telcos and, ultimately, the wider group of customers who have exercised care, to have to bear the cost of compensating the scam losses from authorised transactions."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00169,2023-11-07-T-007,169,Alvin Tan,"Scams involving unauthorised transactions are, of course, fundamentally different. The transfer takes place primarily without the victim's knowledge or consent. That is why we place responsibility on the FIs at the top of the waterfall and the telcos at the second layer, to safeguard the consumer."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00170,2023-11-07-T-007,170,Alvin Tan,"Therefore, the SRF is for phishing scams where the customer is tricked into disclosing his bank credentials and scammers are looking at unauthorised withdrawals."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00171,2023-11-07-T-007,171,Alvin Tan,"I will also share a couple of things that are quite important. This framework has to be seen in a broader scheme of things. What the banks have been doing – and in fact, MAS has been working very closely with them, together with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), as well as the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) – are, and I think the Member would have seen them, some of the changes and developments since the Adjournment Motion."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00172,2023-11-07-T-007,172,Alvin Tan,"First, MAS works very closely with the banks to implement and strengthen anti-scam controls. Since we have discussed in our Adjournment Motion, four major retail banks have rolled out anti-malware controls. These restrict customers' access to their apps, if potentially malicious risky apps not uploaded from official stores or portals, are detected on the customers phones."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00173,2023-11-07-T-007,173,Alvin Tan,"I wanted to update the Member also on how banks are exploring ""money lock"", which allows customers to set aside an amount in their bank accounts which cannot be digitally transferred out without strict authentication measures. For now, DBS, OCBC and UOB will be implementing their versions of ""money lock"" this month."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00174,2023-11-07-T-007,174,Alvin Tan,"I also talked earlier on about the goodwill payment frameworks. MAS is leaning on the banks to be even more accommodative in applying these goodwill payment frameworks, taking into account the sophistication of scam typology, as well as consumers' financial situations, amongst others. So, in concert, these are different measures."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00175,2023-11-07-T-007,175,Alvin Tan,"With regards to the consultation paper, it is ongoing right now. It is from 25 October to 20 December. We are asking six questions, including the questions the Member had asked about the waterfall approach, and about evolving scam typologies and the approaches to this. So, we will take all of the feedback, which have been given to us, and we will review that at the end of it."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00176,2023-11-07-T-007,176,Alvin Tan,"We intend to operationalise the SRF by early next year. So, I encourage the Member to submit, and she can also directly send to me, her comments as well as reviews. There are 15 case studies. I have studied the case studies. These are different duties that either the FIs or telcos have to fulfil."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00177,2023-11-07-T-007,177,Alvin Tan,"But the scenarios are not exhaustive. So, if there are different scenarios that the SRF would benefit from referencing, I think these will be very helpful, as we roll out and operationalise the SRF."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00178,2023-11-07-T-007,178,Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00179,2023-11-07-T-007,179,Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I can also confirm that my Clementi residents have great difficulty when they approach a bank trying to get a physical token. I, myself, approached a bank as well and was told that the physical token had been phased out and it was not an option. So, it seems quite clear that there are a number of banks across Singapore who are making it very hard for customers to get a physical token – making it hard without fear or favour, possibly."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00180,2023-11-07-T-007,180,Tan Wu Meng,"I have three supplementary questions to the Minister. Firstly, I have Clementi residents who were scammed out of their life savings. The preliminary findings suggest these were phishing or malware scams. These residents did not ask to be transitioned to the OTP SMS or a digital token. They did not ask to have all their risks concentrated in a single device – their handphone."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00181,2023-11-07-T-007,181,Tan Wu Meng,"When MAS looks at existing cases, given the new framework, will the goodwill consideration by the banks take into account these new norms?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00182,2023-11-07-T-007,182,Tan Wu Meng,"The second question is, we know that some smartphones already allow malware downloads much more easily than other smartphone operating systems. What is being done to ensure the smartphone manufacturers are awakened to this responsibility and do the right thing by customers?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00183,2023-11-07-T-007,183,Tan Wu Meng,"Thirdly, Mr Speaker, if I can suggest a consumer protection perspective. If today, there was a consumer home appliance and a reasonable lay person could be tricked into using it the wrong way, causing injury or damage that will cost their life savings, we know what the consumer protection approach would be. Will MAS consider this as well, especially given the clear and present concern that so many Clementi residents face?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00184,2023-11-07-T-007,184,Alvin Tan,"Sir, I take both Ms Sylvia Lim and Dr Tan Wu Meng's point about the physical tokens. As I mentioned earlier on, we will work with the banks to ensure that for the physical tokens, there is less friction in consumers requesting for and receiving their physical tokens. So, I thank them for that."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00185,2023-11-07-T-007,185,Alvin Tan,"With regard to the goodwill payment as well as malware and also the consumer facing, please allow me to take a step back and share a few different perspectives."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00186,2023-11-07-T-007,186,Alvin Tan,"The first is that if we think about this, the SRF, in its nature and if you compare what we are doing with what other jurisdictions are doing, we would be the first to look at it from an ecosystem perspective. That means, not just the FIs but now the telcos are involved in this waterfall approach, with the consumers being at the bottom of the waterfall but the FIs at the top of the waterfall. That is important."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00187,2023-11-07-T-007,187,Alvin Tan,"Then, you will ask what happens then to other ecosystem players, such as the tech players?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00188,2023-11-07-T-007,188,Alvin Tan,"The SRF consultation will look at both the wider ecosystem players eventually, because this is a live document and scam topologies will change over time; the approach towards addressing these will also change over time. But for now, we are looking at FIs as well as telcos. In fact, we are the first jurisdiction in the world to include telcos in this reimbursement framework. So, it is a good start and it is a start that we will constantly review and refresh."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00189,2023-11-07-T-007,189,Alvin Tan,"With regard to these other ecosystem players, when we look at it, CSA and SPF have been working, in fact, with key tech players. In fact, Google has been working with IMDA, MAS and FIs to strengthen Android security to better detect malicious apps, for example. The banks, as I mentioned earlier on, have money lock, they have prevented site loading as well, providing these friction measures. So, let us look at it in concert."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00190,2023-11-07-T-007,190,Alvin Tan,"With regard to malware, we understand that malware is a rising concern. I know that people have asked questions about why are malware scams excluded from this version of SRF. The authorities are aware. We are concerned. In fact, not just the Member's Clementi residents but I think many other residents have also experienced malware scams, including many family members as well."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00191,2023-11-07-T-007,191,Alvin Tan,"Thus, malware scams are particularly worrying. For now, the duties that are identified for this version of the SRF work well to address phishing scams. But they are not yet suited to address malware scams because of the evolving and developing nature of malware scams."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00192,2023-11-07-T-007,192,Alvin Tan,"But I want to assure both Members and, in fact, Members of this House, that we will review this new scam variant, such as malware, as part of subsequent updates of SRF. In fact, the consultation paper also provides for that as one of the six questions. And I hope that both Members and other Members as well as members of the public will give us your full support and your full ideas so that we can refine and expand if necessary."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00193,2023-11-07-T-007,193,Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00194,2023-11-07-T-007,194,Sylvia Lim,"Speaker, two further questions for the Minister of State. Earlier, the Minister of State mentioned that SRF, as proposed by MAS, covers only unauthorised transactions. Does he agree with me that even accepting that premise, so long as the banks fulfil the four obligations defined in the paper, even if the bank was negligent in some other way, the bank can actually push the liability down the waterfall? That is my first clarification."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00195,2023-11-07-T-007,195,Sylvia Lim,"Secondly, I wonder whether he is prepared to clarify on this point  assuming the customers are not satisfied under the SRF framework and they have no choice but to go to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC), can the banks rely on the four obligations in the framework to say that, ""Well, under the framework, we have done these four tasks and the paper says that 100% liability goes to you, so, we would not offer you any settlement payments at all."" Can they do this at FIDRec?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00196,2023-11-07-T-007,196,Alvin Tan,"To the second question, it depends on a case-by-case basis. So, for now, if it is unauthorised transactions and if it goes through the waterfall approach, for example, if the FIs have fulfilled their duties, the telcos have fulfilled their duties and, in this case, the customers themselves have fulfilled their duties, then it is up to the banks also to see whether they can implement. And, in fact, they will and have implemented a goodwill payment framework. Importantly, it is that, for it to be fair to the FIs, the telcos as well as consumers, we have to strike a fair balance between responsibility of the FIs and telcos as well as consumers."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00197,2023-11-07-T-007,197,Alvin Tan,"So, the goodwill payment framework has already been operationalised by the banks. MAS will lean in on the banks to tilt the balance towards the banks offering more of these goodwill payment frameworks. But there has to be due consideration."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00198,2023-11-07-T-007,198,Alvin Tan,"For example, if the consumer himself has faced a particular financial hardship, then the banks will take all of these into account when deciding whether to issue a goodwill payment to the consumer."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00199,2023-11-07-T-007,199,Speaker,"Dr Tan Wu Meng, last supplementary question from you, please."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00200,2023-11-07-T-007,200,Tan Wu Meng,I thank the Minister of State for his answer. Can I ask one more supplementary question?
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00201,2023-11-07-T-007,201,Tan Wu Meng,"I have raised previously in this House the idea of forced vs unforced errors, especially given the emergence of new scams, such as deep fakes, where a bank can be masqueraded in a way that seems very authentic."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00202,2023-11-07-T-007,202,Tan Wu Meng,"Can I ask the Minister of State, in this framework, if someone has been tricked by a deep fake scam or a scam that seems so authentic that a reasonable person would be at significant risk of being tricked, would that be an authorised transaction and would it be subject to support and compensation under the waterfall system?"
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00203,2023-11-07-T-007,203,Alvin Tan,"Sir, as I mentioned to the Member, there is a distinction that we need to draw between authorised transaction and unauthorised transaction."
2023-11-07-T-007-S-00204,2023-11-07-T-007,204,Alvin Tan,"If it is an unauthorised transaction and it is a phishing scam, then, depending on how the particular case falls under and goes through the waterfall framework, if there is a liability, if it is found that the FI has to bear, they will bear. If it is found that the telco has to bear, the telco will bear. And then, finally, again, as I mentioned in my reply to Ms Sylvia Lim, if it appears that the consumer has also fulfilled his responsibility, then the banks themselves will look into the specific circumstances to issue these goodwill payments."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00205,2023-11-07-T-008,205,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with reference to the Families100 Programme by OCBC, whether the training provided by the Ministry for volunteers from the bank includes identifying and responding to issues relating to mental health, substance misuse, domestic violence and sexual, physical or emotional abuse or neglect."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00206,2023-11-07-T-008,206,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with reference to the Families100 Programme by OCBC (a) how will the programme be evaluated; and (b) if the evaluation is positive, whether the Ministry will consider expanding the programme to include other population groups and other corporate partners."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00207,2023-11-07-T-008,207,Eric Chua,"Mr Speaker, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 12 and 13 in today's Order Paper together, please?"
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00208,2023-11-07-T-008,208,Speaker,Go ahead.
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00209,2023-11-07-T-008,209,Eric Chua,"Sir, the Families100 Programme is a corporate contribution by OCBC for its staff to volunteer as ComLink befrienders and be paired with an MSF Family Coach, to journey with our ComLink families. The objective is to help the ComLink family achieve the three ""S"" outcomes of Stability, Self-reliance and Social Mobility."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00210,2023-11-07-T-008,210,Eric Chua,"Volunteers are introduced to issues and challenges faced by ComLink families. These include mental health issues, substance misuse and domestic violence or abuse. However, the volunteer befrienders are not expected to provide intervention. Such cases should rightfully be managed by social service or healthcare professionals to whom the families would be referred as needed."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00211,2023-11-07-T-008,211,Eric Chua,"The progress of all 14,000 families with young children in rental housing, including those under the Family100 Programme, will be tracked under ComLink. Hence, there is no need for separate evaluations. We welcome more corporate partners and community groups to volunteer and join us as ComLink befrienders."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00212,2023-11-07-T-008,212,Speaker,Assoc Prof Razwana.
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00213,2023-11-07-T-008,213,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, I appreciate the responses from the Ministry and I am glad that we have put in place some sort of framework to train the staff that are handling such matters. I would like to clarify if there is any standard procedure, in terms of how the referral is done by these volunteers to the social service agencies."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00214,2023-11-07-T-008,214,Eric Chua,"I thank the Member for her supplementary question. When going out and talking to these ComLink families, what we need to remember is that the volunteer befrienders are always paired with a Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) Family Coach, who is a professional in this case."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00215,2023-11-07-T-008,215,Eric Chua,"So, they always go out in pairs, work with these families, talk through their strengths as well as their weaknesses and then, at the end of each session, there will be a debrief and they can look at what are the services, packages, schemes or grants that the families are probably suited and qualify for."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00216,2023-11-07-T-008,216,Eric Chua,"So, it is a considered and paired approach that we are taking. So, the befriender is not one who is left to his or her own devices and he is always benefiting from the help of the MSF Family Coach. I hope that gives some assurance to the Member."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00217,2023-11-07-T-008,217,Speaker,Assoc Prof Razwana.
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00218,2023-11-07-T-008,218,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Thank you. I would like to just clarify one more question in terms of the evaluation. I understand that there is no separate evaluation. However, if we are trying to encourage more private sectors to come on board and take up such initiative to help uplift families, would it be better for us to consider evaluating such a programme so that we can showcase the positive outcome so that others can come on board as well?"
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00219,2023-11-07-T-008,219,Eric Chua,"I thank the Member for her supplementary question. I think we are aligned in terms of wanting to use some of the outcomes and some of the end goals that we want to reach through ComLink and to showcase to more corporates. But bear in mind that we are now at the infancy stage of ComLink rollout. We started the pilots in 2019 in four towns. We ramped it up in 2021 across the whole of Singapore. So, in many ComLink towns today, we are, in fact, in our infancy."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00220,2023-11-07-T-008,220,Eric Chua,"But in time to come, we hope to be able to show some of these, not just outcomes, because in terms of outcomes of achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility, some of these indicators will take some time for us to bear fruit."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00221,2023-11-07-T-008,221,Eric Chua,"So, we do want to also look at some of the throughput and output indicators and, eventually, hopefully, have some good outcome indications to show for it."
2023-11-07-T-008-S-00222,2023-11-07-T-008,222,Eric Chua,"So, we are aligned in the sense that we want to show some of this progress and some of these achievements along the way to more corporates and to more volunteers so that they can all step forward."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00223,2023-11-07-T-009,223,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there exists a whole-of-Government plan to develop indigenous capabilities in creating and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, including establishing a National Foundation Model Research Institute, so as to help local researchers build core AI foundation model expertise; and (b) if such an AI foundation model plan already exists, what are its core and strategic aims."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00224,2023-11-07-T-009,224,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, Singapore's research capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) are well-regarded."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00225,2023-11-07-T-009,225,Janil Puthucheary,"We generally rank among the top 10 countries based on publications at leading AI conferences across areas, such as natural language processing and computer vision."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00226,2023-11-07-T-009,226,Janil Puthucheary,"We also have an active AI industry research scene, with industry research and development (R&D) centres by companies, such as Salesforce, SAP and Alibaba."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00227,2023-11-07-T-009,227,Janil Puthucheary,"As such, Singapore has a strong base of AI researchers who are already working on various aspects of foundation models (FMs), such as helping FMs better understand visual and audio inputs, evaluating the performance of FMs and developing FMs that are more suited for regional use cases."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00228,2023-11-07-T-009,228,Janil Puthucheary,"It is not usually necessary or beneficial to rely solely on indigenous capabilities to advance our economic interests. For example, Singapore has built up thriving aerospace manufacturing and aviation services without developing or owning aircraft technologies."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00229,2023-11-07-T-009,229,Janil Puthucheary,"That said, we recognise the value of investing in research capabilities to support talent development and enterprise innovation. We have a vibrant research ecosystem for AI and will continue to support useful endeavours, including various aspects of FMs."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00230,2023-11-07-T-009,230,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00231,2023-11-07-T-009,231,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Could I just clarify then that there is no whole-of-Government plan to develop indigenous AI FMs in Singapore? I am asking this because many other countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are committing to ambitious programmes to develop their own indigenous FMs."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00232,2023-11-07-T-009,232,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said last month, during his trip to the United States that Singapore is not at the cutting edge of ITS. The latest ideas and innovations will still come from American universities and companies, but that we can be a fast adopter. So, can I clarify that the approach for Singapore is that we are going to be a fast adopter and not going to lead in the building of FMs?"
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00233,2023-11-07-T-009,233,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Secondly, does the Government see any long-term risks in outsourcing the development of FM research and development?"
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00234,2023-11-07-T-009,234,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"And lastly, when using the large language models (LLMs) developed by foreign companies, how does it ensure that the confidential data is not disclosed?"
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00235,2023-11-07-T-009,235,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I am mindful of time. On the last question that Mr Gerald Giam has asked, it is large area about how we protect the privacy of our systems and the management of data around AI. I think it is a whole area. I would encourage them to file a question on that so that we could have a discussion."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00236,2023-11-07-T-009,236,Janil Puthucheary,Let me try and address his first two questions.
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00237,2023-11-07-T-009,237,Janil Puthucheary,"I would say though that I would push back a little and disagree with his characterisations that we are either going to outsource or we are going to develop capabilities locally. And, in truth, you have to do both and even large continent-sized countries are doing both. We do recognise the potential of FMs to significantly enhance productivity to enable new services. And most use cases in the world leverage on existing FMs, either off-the-shelf, customise via methods, such as retrieval augmentation of finetuning."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00238,2023-11-07-T-009,238,Janil Puthucheary,"We do have groups that are experimenting and building FMs on such issues, such as to better translate regional languages, improving our understanding on how to govern FMs."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00239,2023-11-07-T-009,239,Janil Puthucheary,But we do so in a prudent and phased manner. We are starting with smaller size models. We have received industry interest to collaborate. These efforts are relatively nascent and we will be examining our plans on how to scale up further with details to be announced later this year.
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00240,2023-11-07-T-009,240,Janil Puthucheary,"We are supporting an initiative to build our own family of FMs through AI Singapore, named SEA-LION, or Southeast Asian languages In One Network, and training to better address regional use cases, which is a gap in existing FMs."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00241,2023-11-07-T-009,241,Janil Puthucheary,"So, we are building these models in a phased manner. We have developed two small ones so far. They have been published. They are open for public and research use and we have received industry interest."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00242,2023-11-07-T-009,242,Janil Puthucheary,The Government also has been proactively looking at how to develop FMs to improve our own productivity.
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00243,2023-11-07-T-009,243,Janil Puthucheary,"My key point then, Sir, is that I would characterise the issue not as either indigenous capabilities or outsourcing but, in truth, the appropriate combination of both and we have already begun on this journey."
2023-11-07-T-009-S-00244,2023-11-07-T-009,244,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. Introduction of Government Bills. Minister for Home Affairs.

2023-11-07-T-011-S-00249,2023-11-07-T-011,249,Alvin Tan,"Sir, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00250,2023-11-07-T-011,250,Alvin Tan,The Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill amends the Act to provide for tax incentive changes which were introduced in Budget 2022 and Budget 2023. There are a total of six sets of legislative changes contained in the Bill. Let me first elaborate on the changes announced at Budget 2022.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00251,2023-11-07-T-011,251,Alvin Tan,"The Ministry of Finance (MOF) had announced at Budget 2022 the discontinuance of the Integrated Investment Allowance (IIA) scheme after 31 December 2022. This IIA scheme, which was introduced in 2012, was intended to incentivise manufacturers to adopt twin models of their operations between Singapore and Iskandar Malaysia in Johor, or the islands of Batam, Bintan and Karimun in Indonesia. However, administrative complexities of tax computation in different jurisdictions made it challenging to operationalise the scheme."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00252,2023-11-07-T-011,252,Alvin Tan,"As the IIA scheme was allowed to lapse after 31 December 2022, clause 16 deletes Part 9 of the Act to remove references to the IIA scheme while clause 19 provides for consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 1947."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00253,2023-11-07-T-011,253,Alvin Tan,The second tax incentive scheme to be amended pertains to the Approved Foreign Loan (AFL) scheme.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00254,2023-11-07-T-011,254,Alvin Tan,"First, clause 7 will extend the AFL scheme to 31 December 2028. Second, new section 35(2) and (4) are inserted by clause 8 to enhance the powers of the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Finance."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00255,2023-11-07-T-011,255,Alvin Tan,"Today, an AFL incentive recipient incurs a debt payable to the Government if the recipient contravenes a condition of approval or section 34 by selling, transferring or disposing of equipment that was purchased and financed from an approved foreign loan without the Minister for Trade and Industry's permission. This debt arises even when the company has already delivered its economic commitments as part of the AFL support or when the contraventions were unintentional or when any decision to sell, transfer or dispose of the equipment was reasonable and not of wilful intent."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00256,2023-11-07-T-011,256,Alvin Tan,"With the new amendments, the Minister for Trade and Industry may decide whether to revoke the approval for the loan where any relevant contravention has taken place. If the approval is revoked, a debt to the Government arises. But the Minister for Finance may waive the debt in whole or in part if the Minister for Finance is satisfied that the recipient did not knowingly or intentionally contravene the condition or section 34."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00257,2023-11-07-T-011,257,Alvin Tan,This legislative change allows debt liabilities to be imposed in a more targeted manner.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00258,2023-11-07-T-011,258,Alvin Tan,"The third tax incentive scheme is the Approved Royalties Incentive (ARI) scheme. The legislative amendments in clauses 2, 10 and 12 will extend the scheme by five years to 31 December 2028 and enhance the administration of the ARI scheme by shifting from an agreement-based approach to an activity-based approach from 1 April 2023."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00259,2023-11-07-T-011,259,Alvin Tan,"Under the agreement-based approach that was in place before 1 April 2023, companies were required to obtain the Economic Development Board (EDB)'s approval for every addition of an agreement or variation of an agreement in the ARI certificate. However, as the use of intangible assets and intellectual property has become more pervasive, we need a more flexible approach to respond to companies' investment interests."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00260,2023-11-07-T-011,260,Alvin Tan,"Under the activity-based approach, the scope of the approved activity is specified in the certificate. Companies will enjoy tax exemptions or concessionary withholding tax rates for royalties, fees or contributions payable under all agreements entered into for the purpose of the approved activity. Companies will not need to undergo the onerous administrative process of seeking new approvals each time a new agreement is reached or an existing agreement is varied."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00261,2023-11-07-T-011,261,Alvin Tan,"To be clear, this is not a relaxation of the scheme. We will still clearly define the activities which are supportable under the ARI incentive and companies that make claims under agreements which are not covered by a supportable activity will still have their claims rejected and must pay the full prevailing withholding tax."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00262,2023-11-07-T-011,262,Alvin Tan,"Sir, please allow me to elaborate next on the tax incentive changes announced at Budget 2023."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00263,2023-11-07-T-011,263,Alvin Tan,The Pioneer Certificate (PC) scheme and the Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) scheme will be extended by five years to 31 December 2028. Clauses 3 and 5 will effect the extension of the PC scheme while clause 6 will effect that of the DEI scheme. Both schemes remain relevant and effective in anchoring desired investments in Singapore.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00264,2023-11-07-T-011,264,Alvin Tan,The fifth set of legislative amendments applies to the Investment Allowance (IA) scheme.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00265,2023-11-07-T-011,265,Alvin Tan,"The amendments to the IA scheme include (a) the extension of the IA scheme by five years for certain qualifying activities by clause 14(d) and 14(e); and (b) the removal of the qualifying activity of aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul services, given it has been assessed to be no longer relevant and the power to approve such projects lapsed in 2015. Clauses 13, 14(a), 14(b) and 14(c) remove references to this qualifying activity."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00266,2023-11-07-T-011,266,Alvin Tan,"The last legislative amendment in clause 18 inserts a new section 61A to provide the Minister for Trade and Industry with retrospective revocation powers across all incentives under the Act in two scenarios. The first scenario is the removal of any activity, agreement, arrangement, product or other matter from a certificate or letter. The second scenario is the revocation of any approval, certificate or letter."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00267,2023-11-07-T-011,267,Alvin Tan,"This amendment is aligned with the Income Tax Act 1947 and will allow the Government to respond proportionately when dealing with incentive breaches. There is no impact on tax incentive recipients who meet their conditions and commitments. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00268,2023-11-07-T-011,268,Alvin Tan,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00269,2023-11-07-T-011,269,Mark Lee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as a board member and a shareholder of Crystal International Group Limited, whose group turnover is in excess of  €"
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00270,2023-11-07-T-011,270,Mark Lee,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Singapore is home to a vibrant and diversified corporate ecosystem. There are close to 40,000 international companies in Singapore, contributing about 30% of employment and 56% to value added over the past few years. Foreign direct investment inflow into Singapore reached $195 billion in 2022, reflecting robust growth year-on-year. MNCs are an important part of a healthy economy, driving growth sectors and working in partnership with SMEs in their value chain to deliver value to the economy."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00271,2023-11-07-T-011,271,Mark Lee,The business community supports the Economic Expansion Incentives Scheme as this is an important aspect of our national strategy to attract and anchor MNCs in Singapore.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00272,2023-11-07-T-011,272,Mark Lee,(In English)  The latest amendment to the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Bill seeks to enhance the existing incentives scheme by introducing a new Approved Activities scheme in place of the ARI scheme. This change includes transitional provisions to facilitate a smooth transition to support the shift to the new scheme.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00273,2023-11-07-T-011,273,Mark Lee,"This amendment is a response to the evolving complexity of business structures, which necessitates a more dynamic and robust framework for managing tax incentives. The new scheme simplifies the process for businesses to manage shared costs amongst various agreements and streamlines the administration of tax incentives by considering the operations of large companies that are engaged in multiple contracts for a fixed activity."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00274,2023-11-07-T-011,274,Mark Lee,"Nevertheless, with the shift from an approval-centric system to an activity-centric system, it becomes essential to define what constitutes an approved activity more clearly. Given the diverse and concurrent projects businesses often undertake, the Government could offer clear guidelines and examples of eligible activities. Providing this clarity will facilitate the application process, reduce duplications and lessen the need for handling exceptions."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00275,2023-11-07-T-011,275,Mark Lee,"Shifting focus to a wider perspective, Singapore's dedication to fostering a favourable tax landscape for businesses remains steadfast. This dedication is exemplified by the latest revision."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00276,2023-11-07-T-011,276,Mark Lee,"In the previous year, this Bill was amended to support companies undertaking emission reduction initiatives, encompassing investment in technology and equipment that contributes to quantifiable reductions in greenhouse gases."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00277,2023-11-07-T-011,277,Mark Lee,"This proactive change, spurred by feedback from the industry, underscores the significance of continual regulatory reviews. It ensures that our tax incentives stay in step with both national goals and the changing landscapes of business and investments."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00278,2023-11-07-T-011,278,Mark Lee,"However, it is crucial to be cognisant of broader international trends, like the forthcoming Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 guidelines, which pose a challenge to the effectiveness of Singapore's tax incentives, particularly for multinational enterprises with a global turnover of at least €750 million. In response to these changes, the Singapore Government has pledged to bolster non-tax benefits to preserve and enhance Singapore’s competitive appeal in a landscape that is rapidly evolving due to the new BEPS 2.0 norms."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00279,2023-11-07-T-011,279,Mark Lee,"From a competitive vantage point, these incentives remain particularly crucial especially for certain mobile activities such as finance and research and development. Such activities are pivotal and economically significant to Singapore. The stark reality is that some multinational enterprises may hesitate at the prospect of meeting the conditions of these incentives, like substantial investment thresholds and local employment quotas, if the tax benefits do not translate into significant global savings."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00280,2023-11-07-T-011,280,Mark Lee,"With this in mind, it is imperative for the Government to explore how our incentives might evolve to align with the Pillar 2 regulations of the BEPS framework. Tax professionals have identified a variety of ""BEPS-protected"" incentives that comply with the Pillar 2 Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules. Therefore, studying these models could provide us with a pathway to adapt and preserve the efficacy of Singapore's tax incentives."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00281,2023-11-07-T-011,281,Mark Lee,"One viable path forward could be the introduction of Qualified Refundable Tax Credits (QRTCs). These credits would be refundable, translating into cash or cash equivalents over a four-year period. QRTCs could be strategically directed towards fostering innovation, acting as an enhancement to the current research and development (R&D) tax incentives."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00282,2023-11-07-T-011,282,Mark Lee,"Another possible solution might be the Market Transferable Tax Credit (MTTC), which could function as an investment tax credit. This credit would bolster sustainability and innovation-driven investments. Comparable tax credits are in operation in countries like the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States, where they are treated as income rather than mere tax deductions for GLoBE purposes."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00283,2023-11-07-T-011,283,Mark Lee,"Another way to manage the impact of BEPS 2.0 on businesses and investments is to offer more expenditure-related incentives. For example, Singapore does not offer building allowances unless they meet the conditions for Land Intensification Allowance. However, not all business activities are suited to intensify land use and certain investments do not even qualify for such allowances in the first place, such as clean rooms and even R&D facilities."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00284,2023-11-07-T-011,284,Mark Lee,These types of investments are significant and a multi-faceted strategy is crucial to navigate the intricacies introduced by Pillar 2. Such a strategy ensures Singapore remains a top-tier destination for innovation among multinational enterprises.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00285,2023-11-07-T-011,285,Mark Lee,"In conclusion, the Government's continuous refinement of our tax incentive strategies represents and reflects our strong dedication to evolving alongside the global business and taxation landscape, reinforcing Singapore’s allure as a prime location for multinational companies (MNCs). These reforms not only appeal to MNCs but also generate a ripple effect that benefits small and medium-sized enterprises by enhancing their international ties, increasing business opportunities and fostering technological partnerships."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00286,2023-11-07-T-011,286,Mark Lee,"For a small, open economy like ours, these initiatives are critical by preserving our competitive edge and ensuring a favourable climate for sustainable economic development and the success of businesses of all scales. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00287,2023-11-07-T-011,287,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00288,2023-11-07-T-011,288,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, I had previously spoken on multiple occasions about the importance of Government policy to further orientate our economy toward knowledge-intensive industries."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00289,2023-11-07-T-011,289,Jamus Jerome Lim,"A few months back, I did so in the context of the National Productivity Fund, where I stressed how funding for R&D should be clearly directed toward onshore investments and technology adoption. And in response to Deputy Prime Minister Wong's Budget speech this year, I also specifically touched on how R&D credits being explicitly exempted from the OECD's BEPS 2.0 framework may be exploited as a potential loophole by multinationals."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00290,2023-11-07-T-011,290,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Today, I hope to begin by revisiting the earlier issue of R&D credit loopholes in light of the provisions of this Bill. I will then move on to the broader topic of how we plan to continue providing incentives for corporations to locate in Singapore in the wake of a full roll-out of BEPS."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00291,2023-11-07-T-011,291,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Clauses 10 through 12 make amendments to sections 37 and 39 of the original Act and also introduce a new section 40. These all deal with a new approved royalty initiative or ARI scheme which spells out tax benefits for royalties as well as technical assistance fees or contributions to R&D costs. These amendments set out specific protection associated with intellectual property (IP). To be clear, IP has value and should be appropriately remunerated, a point that I had also made previously on two occasions in this House."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00292,2023-11-07-T-011,292,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But in those speeches, I also suggested that there is a tendency for producers of IP to seek protection that would allow them to secure intellectual monopolies and that not every class of IP is deserving of equal protection."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00293,2023-11-07-T-011,293,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In the context of this Bill, then my first concern whether the granting of tax concessions for royalties may be justified. In my mind, providing such relief for royalties received by small, independent producers of IP is entirely reasonable, since the amounts involved are typically modest and are likely to constitute a very paltry supplementary income for artists involved in creative work for which we would like very much to encourage in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00294,2023-11-07-T-011,294,Jamus Jerome Lim,"At this point, I should declare that for many years, my family received royalties associated with several musical compositions by my father, although we have since allowed these to lapse."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00295,2023-11-07-T-011,295,Jamus Jerome Lim,"However, it is less clear that tax relief for royalties received at the corporate level, especially in large multinationals, are as easily justifiable. True. We wish to encourage creativity and innovation and tax exemptions are indeed one way to do so. However, tax incentives offered at the pre-production stage are also an important way to encourage taking on activities such as R&D that carry uncertain payoffs."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00296,2023-11-07-T-011,296,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But royalties received by large corporations occur after the fact and, moreover, are likely to already be subject to corporate taxation in other jurisdictions in which the MNC operates. While it is true that corporations consider the full expected returns from their investments even before embarking on any innovative effort, it is unclear why Singapore should be the jurisdiction that offers such an ex-post write-off, if others do not."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00297,2023-11-07-T-011,297,Jamus Jerome Lim,"A second concern has to do with how the new ARI scheme differs from our existing programmes. What was the take-up rate of the old ARI and how does the Ministry believe that the new scheme improves on the old? Relatedly, how does the new ARI differ from the pioneer industry, pioneer service and development and expansion incentives that also appear to fall under the Economic Expansion Incentives Act."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00298,2023-11-07-T-011,298,Jamus Jerome Lim,"And, finally, my third and perhaps greatest concern has to do with the risk that the expanded scope of the new ARI seems to now offer tax exemptions to non-resident persons, as opposed to being limited to the current treatment where royalties qualify for tax concessions only if they are earned in Singapore by either residents or permanent establishments here."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00299,2023-11-07-T-011,299,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Section 40(b), for instance, states that and, I quote, ""relevant royalties, fees or contributions are payable to a non-resident person during the period of approval for that activity."" If this is true, I am concerned that the provision may inadvertently become a means for international companies to use the R&D tax credits as a means of skirting their BEPS 2.0 minimum tax obligations, with very little direct benefits to Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00300,2023-11-07-T-011,300,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The mechanism would entail MNC's booking royalties in Singapore for the purposes of qualifying for the tax write-off even when such IP are unrelated to income earned or derived in Singapore, as was previously the case. If so, then we would merely have facilitated a continued race to the bottom in tax competition, where governments no longer compete to set the lowest tax rate but grant the most lavish R&D tax credits."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00301,2023-11-07-T-011,301,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To get a foretaste of what this could imply it is instructive to look to Ireland. Due to the overwhelming presence of multinationals booking IP activity and income, often classified as intangibles in Ireland, there has been an increasing divergence in Irish gross domestic product, which measures all activity recorded within the country's borders, and Irish gross national income, which nets out foreign income, including profits sent abroad. Further, accounting for depreciation of IP reviews, by one calculation, gross national income (GNI) is only a little more than half of official gross domestic product (GDP) in Ireland."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00302,2023-11-07-T-011,302,Jamus Jerome Lim,"These distortions provide an inaccurate picture of genuine economic progress in that country and, perhaps more critically, provide few jobs or income to Irish citizens. The artificial, almost comical nature of the phenomenon has even been dubbed leprechaun economics by Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00303,2023-11-07-T-011,303,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, my hope is that nobody will start to question whether Singapore's hard-won economic progress is actually ""pontianak"" or ""hantu"" economics and by the same token, I trust that the treatment of royalties in the new ARI scheme will not inadvertently give rise to the same pathology."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00304,2023-11-07-T-011,304,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Allow me to now move on to the broader context of the Bill, which has to do with our nation's preparedness for the roll-out of BEPS 2.0. As this House is well aware, the agreement continues to grind inexorably forward, most recently making significant progress on negotiation pertaining to amounts A and B of Pillar 1 and subject to tax rule of Pillar 2. The onus is thus on us as a nation to prepare our economy, companies and workers to thrive beyond 2024 when agreement comes into fully effect."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00305,2023-11-07-T-011,305,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Will the Ministry, therefore, share with this House whether it has made progress in projections of the potential revenue impact should the agreement proceed as planned? MOF had previously explained, and I quote, that ""Pillar 1 will result in a loss of revenue""."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00306,2023-11-07-T-011,306,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While the minimum effective tax rate top-up could result in higher tax revenue, if there is limited flight in existing economic activity, I appreciate that it is of course impossible to fully predict with much precision what the net revenue outcome is going to be. But surely the Ministry has at least outlined revenue implications based on several possible scenarios. If so, would the MOF share their homework with this House?"
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00307,2023-11-07-T-011,307,Jamus Jerome Lim,"More generally, it would be useful to understand the Government's strategy for and plans to attract and retain foreign investments going forward. The Ministry has indicated that Singapore will need to strengthen non-tax factors to stay competitive in a post-BEPS world."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00308,2023-11-07-T-011,308,Jamus Jerome Lim,"What does the Government have in mind in terms of these non-tax factors beyond the usual arguments that we offer a skilled workforce, cutting-edge infrastructure and secure investment protections? After all, these elements have been unchanging value propositions for quite a while now. And if there are changes at the margin that diminish our attractiveness, we must surely offset this by improving something that we have hitherto not yet been able to offer."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00309,2023-11-07-T-011,309,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, the stipulations in this Bill are another small step forward for preparing our economy for a post-BEPS world and for that reason it has my support. It is important, however, that in doing so we do not compromise the purpose of BEPS and inadvertently become a tool for multinational tax evasion but instead focus on the real intangibles, we can offer as a nation to be an attractive destination for domestic and foreign investment, both into 2024 as well as beyond."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00310,2023-11-07-T-011,310,Speaker,Minister of State Tan.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00311,2023-11-07-T-011,311,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members Mark Lee as well as Assoc Prof Jamus Lim for their support of the Bill and also for giving me the opportunity to make some clarifications."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00312,2023-11-07-T-011,312,Alvin Tan,"Let me start. There were a lot going on in both their speeches, so, allow me to take them one by one."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00313,2023-11-07-T-011,313,Alvin Tan,Mr Mark Lee asked for greater clarity on the activities supportable under the ARI scheme and highlighted the importance of refreshing our slate of incentives to align with BEPS 2.0 rules. These are quite similar to what Assoc Prof Lim had also mentioned.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00314,2023-11-07-T-011,314,Alvin Tan,"Allow me to first clarify on the ARI. There is no change in the scope and intent in terms of what the Government seeks to support under ARI with this enhancement of the approval approach from an agreement-based approach, as I mentioned earlier on, an activities-based approach."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00315,2023-11-07-T-011,315,Alvin Tan,"I agree with the Member on the need for clarity over the scope of an approved activity and I wish to assure Members that this new approach will be no different from the approach that we already take for other tax incentives, such as the Development and Expansion Incentive, as I mentioned earlier on."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00316,2023-11-07-T-011,316,Alvin Tan,"Given that we aim to attract investments of different profiles and across sectors, the approved activity could vary from project to project. EDB will indeed work with companies to define what approved activity would mean in the context of a particular investment. And it is in the interest of both the company as well as the Government for this to be very clearly articulated."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00317,2023-11-07-T-011,317,Alvin Tan,"Mr Mark Lee also correctly noted that the implementation of Pillar 2 of BEPS 2.0 could reduce the effectiveness of certain tax incentives since multinational enterprises with consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million would have to bear a minimum effective tax rate (METR) of 15%, wherever they operate. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim mentioned this as well. It means that we must work even harder to secure Singapore's competitiveness as an investment location."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00318,2023-11-07-T-011,318,Alvin Tan,I would like to emphasise that tax incentives still do remain an important tool for us for two reasons.
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00319,2023-11-07-T-011,319,Alvin Tan,"First, multinationals under the revenue threshold of €750 million are not in the scope of Pillar 2, as Members known, and will thus continue to benefit from concessionary tax rate incentives."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00320,2023-11-07-T-011,320,Alvin Tan,"Second, the METR of 15% under Pillar 2 does not apply to withholding taxes, which the AFL and ARI schemes seek to reduce. I would like to assure Members that the Government maintains a high bar in terms of the commitments expected from recipients of these incentives. We will hold incentive recipients accountable for their commitments and will not hesitate to amend or withdraw the incentives in the event of breaches, especially if these beaches are wilful ones."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00321,2023-11-07-T-011,321,Alvin Tan,"I would also like to thank Members for their suggestions on the different types of incentives that may comply with Pillar 2 of GloBE rules. The Government reviews and refreshes our incentive toolkit on an ongoing basis even as we strengthen our non-incentive advantages, such as the ones that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim had mentioned – our talent pool, our infrastructure, our connectivity. We will take the Members' suggestions into account during these reviews."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00322,2023-11-07-T-011,322,Alvin Tan,"Companies take the total cost of the business into account. They do not look at withholding taxes just in isolation. We consider providing concessionary withholding tax only if it is a necessary to anchor the investment here in Singapore, for the benefit of Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00323,2023-11-07-T-011,323,Alvin Tan,"To Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's question, there is actually no change in the intent of the ARI. The aim is and has always been to anchor economic benefits in Singapore. We are just making it easier to administer it for companies and that helps to spur investments into Singapore. I hope that clarifies."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00324,2023-11-07-T-011,324,Alvin Tan,"We consider tax incentives notional in nature. If not for these incentives, there is actually a very real potential that these investments may not be here – in which case, then, there is just no tax to collect in the first place."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00325,2023-11-07-T-011,325,Alvin Tan,"So, I fully agree on a need to strengthen our non-tax propositions and we are working hard on all of the natural advantages that Singapore has, that I think this House had mentioned and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim in the past had also mentioned. I thank both Members for their reviews."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00326,2023-11-07-T-011,326,Alvin Tan,"Again, let me reiterate in closing that our tax incentives are really useful tools which our economic agencies like Enterprise Singapore, EDB and the rest, are able to use to attract new investment commitments into Singapore. We know for this that will provide intangible economic benefits in the form of value added, in the form of business expenditure. Ultimately, what we want in this House is good jobs for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00327,2023-11-07-T-011,327,Alvin Tan,"Among the variety of tools available, tax incentives have been one of the most economically efficient as the tax benefit is premised on the company being profitable. We have good success in securing substantive business investments and also generating positive economic outcomes."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00328,2023-11-07-T-011,328,Alvin Tan,"Regardless of their country of origin or size, firms can stand to benefit from tax incentives as long as their investments are able to generate substantive economic outcomes – the ones that I had just mentioned. I hope that we can continue to anchor more firms and new capabilities in Singapore as the economy grows and as developments, including in METR, as well as BEPS evolve over time."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00329,2023-11-07-T-011,329,Alvin Tan,"Through the use of these incentives, there will also be benefits generated to the local ecosystem through the transfer of tech capabilities and skillsets to SMEs, as Mr Mark Lee had mentioned and re-emphasised."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00330,2023-11-07-T-011,330,Alvin Tan,"Mr Speaker, I would like to emphasise and assure Members of this House that the Government is committed to maintaining a business-friendly environment here in Singapore. We will continue to take in Members' reviews, requests and comments, and review the effectiveness our incentives regularly in order to better influence investors' investment decisions and, ultimately, help Singaporeans and Singapore businesses capture economic value generated through these investments."
2023-11-07-T-011-S-00331,2023-11-07-T-011,331,Alvin Tan,We look forward to the continued support of this House in our endeavours.

2023-11-07-T-012-S-00339,2023-11-07-T-012,339,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00340,2023-11-07-T-012,340,Rahayu Mahzam,"Sir, this Bill contains amendments to the Legal Profession Act 1966 to lift the overall standards of the professional training regime for lawyers, following the work of the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers (the Committee) and to make other miscellaneous and technical amendments."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00341,2023-11-07-T-012,341,Rahayu Mahzam,The Committee was set up by the honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in August 2016 to conduct a root-and-branch review of the professional training regime for lawyers. This review was aimed at raising the quality and consistency of training standards across the industry.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00342,2023-11-07-T-012,342,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Committee was chaired by Justice Quentin Loh and comprised 14 other members including representatives from the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Ministry of Law (MinLaw), the Law Society of Singapore, the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association and various Singapore law practices."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00343,2023-11-07-T-012,343,Rahayu Mahzam,"A working group comprising representatives from MinLaw, the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE), the Supreme Court and the Law Society of Singapore was subsequently set up to implement and operationalise the Committee's recommendations, which my Ministry had accepted in-principle."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00344,2023-11-07-T-012,344,Rahayu Mahzam,"A separate working group was established by the SILE to implement the Committee's recommendations on Part B and practice training. This working group comprises representatives from the SILE's Board, Singapore law practices, the three local law schools, the Law Society, the Singapore Academy of Law, the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association, the Attorney-General's Chambers and MinLaw."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00345,2023-11-07-T-012,345,Rahayu Mahzam,"In 2019, MinLaw conducted a public consultation on the working group's proposals for implementing the Committee's recommendations. The respondents comprised a good mix of practitioners, in-house counsel, law students, young lawyers and members of the public. The majority supported the working group's proposals."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00346,2023-11-07-T-012,346,Rahayu Mahzam,This Bill contains amendments to implement these recommendations by the Committee  (a) decouple admission to the Singapore Bar from the completion of practice training contracts; (b) lengthen the practice training period from six months to one year; (c) confer on practice trainees limited rights to practise after six months of training; (d) permit up to three months of the practice training period to be completed at approved in-house legal departments of approved corporations; and (e) introduce a moratorium for practice training contract applications.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00347,2023-11-07-T-012,347,Rahayu Mahzam,"I will now cover each of the key amendments in turn. The rest of the Committee's recommendations will be implemented progressively via guidance notes and industry announcements, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders from the working group."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00348,2023-11-07-T-012,348,Rahayu Mahzam,I will start with the amendment in relation to decoupling admission to the Singapore Bar from the completion of practice training contracts.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00349,2023-11-07-T-012,349,Rahayu Mahzam,"The existing framework for admission to the Singapore Bar as an Advocate and Solicitor (A&S) requires law graduates to, amongst other requirements, pass Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations (the Part B examinations) and complete a prescribed practice training period."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00350,2023-11-07-T-012,350,Rahayu Mahzam,"During the practice training period, the law graduate receives supervised training in relation to the practice of Singapore law under a formal training arrangement. This formal training arrangement between a law graduate and a Singapore law practice is known as a ""practice training contract""."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00351,2023-11-07-T-012,351,Rahayu Mahzam,"Clause 6 of the Bill introduces a new category of individuals. Law graduates who pass the Part B examinations can now be admitted to the Singapore Bar as a lawyer (non-practitioner), or lawyer (NP), without needing to complete the prescribed practice training period."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00352,2023-11-07-T-012,352,Rahayu Mahzam,A lawyer (NP) does not have the right to practise in law firms and similar entities; instead a lawyer (NP) can adopt alternative pathways such as becoming in-house counsel or in academia.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00353,2023-11-07-T-012,353,Rahayu Mahzam,The prescribed practice training period remains compulsory for a lawyer (NP) who wishes to practise law in a law firm or similar entity. Such a lawyer (NP) may be admitted as an A&S and will have the rights and obligations of one after the completion of the prescribed practice training period.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00354,2023-11-07-T-012,354,Rahayu Mahzam,This enhancement to the admission framework recognises that a legal education can lead to different legal career pathways.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00355,2023-11-07-T-012,355,Rahayu Mahzam,"MinLaw remains focused on developing a strong core of practising lawyers to serve Singapore's society and to provide high quality legal services to enhance our business environment. However, our reality is one of a fast-changing operating environment and we need legal talent to support all aspects of our economy and society."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00356,2023-11-07-T-012,356,Rahayu Mahzam,"Law graduates can join in-house counsel teams, legal tech companies or enter academia. They can contribute to the legal services sector and in other sectors which may benefit from legal expertise in a variety of roles and functions."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00357,2023-11-07-T-012,357,Rahayu Mahzam,"For those who do not intend to practise, this change allows them to be admitted to the Singapore Bar earlier, since they do not need to complete practice training. This also frees up more practice training contracts for those who intend to practise law."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00358,2023-11-07-T-012,358,Rahayu Mahzam,"As highlighted in the Forward SG report, one of our shared visions is to embrace a wider variety of career pathways. We are committed to recognising that there are diverse pathways that are available for our lawyers to develop their full potential. Hence, this change will allow law graduates who do not wish to practise to embark on their chosen career pathways sooner."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00359,2023-11-07-T-012,359,Rahayu Mahzam,"A lawyer (NP)’s rights and obligations will be similar to a non-practising A&S who does not have in force a Practising Certificate (PC). For example, lawyers (NP) may work as in-house counsel and may provide pro bono or free legal advice. They will also be members of the Singapore Academy of Law and be members of the Law Society of Singapore. Lawyers (NP) will also be officers of the court, like A&Ses today, and subject to the disciplinary oversight of the Courts."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00360,2023-11-07-T-012,360,Rahayu Mahzam,"Furthermore, under Clause 16 of the Bill, a lawyer (NP) who is employed by a law practice, but is not a practice trainee and who does not have a provisional PC, may be registered as a regulated non-practitioner under section 36G of the Act. Such registration will be subject to the prevailing framework for regulated non-practitioners, including being entitled to be a director, partner or shareholder of a law firm or similar entity."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00361,2023-11-07-T-012,361,Rahayu Mahzam,I will elaborate on provisional PCs later on.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00362,2023-11-07-T-012,362,Rahayu Mahzam,"Similarly, the Bill will also permit non-practising A&Ses to be registered as regulated non-practitioners, subject to the prevailing requirements. This acknowledges that an individual who is admitted to the Singapore Bar, can contribute to a law practice even if he or she does not practise."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00363,2023-11-07-T-012,363,Rahayu Mahzam,"Moving on, I also wish to highlight that the Committee also recommended lengthening the practice training period, which is currently a minimum of six months, to one year. While this change will be given effect to via upcoming amendments to the subsidiary legislation, I would like to mention this briefly, so that Members have an overall picture of the changes."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00364,2023-11-07-T-012,364,Rahayu Mahzam,"This change is only one example of consistent efforts to holistically lift the standards of the legal industry. My Ministry is also involved in ongoing reviews in other aspects covering areas such as legal education, and ethics and professional standards of lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00365,2023-11-07-T-012,365,Rahayu Mahzam,These reviews aim to enhance the quality of the legal workforce and complement the Committee’s recommendations.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00366,2023-11-07-T-012,366,Rahayu Mahzam,"In an increasingly complex and competitive operating environment, there is a greater demand for legal professionals that provide high-quality advice and solutions to clients with multi-faceted problems."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00367,2023-11-07-T-012,367,Rahayu Mahzam,One key objective is to produce law graduates who will be equipped with the necessary skill sets and be better prepared to enter into the legal workforce.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00368,2023-11-07-T-012,368,Rahayu Mahzam,"In conjunction with these efforts, the lengthened practice training period will  give practice trainees a longer period of direct mentorship to develop a strong foundation for a sustainable and fulfilling career in legal practice; better equip practice trainees for entry into private practice through greater exposure to a range of practice areas; and allow law practices to make a more holistic assessment of trainees’ performance."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00369,2023-11-07-T-012,369,Rahayu Mahzam,"In other jurisdictions like France, Germany and Hong Kong, there is also emphasis on the practice training to complement formal education where solicitors are required to undergo two years of training."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00370,2023-11-07-T-012,370,Rahayu Mahzam,The SILE has published a detailed Notice on New Admission Regime on their website. The Notice captures the proposals from the multi-stakeholder working groups. It outlines the new training requirements and options available to law graduates seeking to complete their practice training period.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00371,2023-11-07-T-012,371,Rahayu Mahzam,"MinLaw is aware of industry concerns surrounding the lengthened practice training period, including the additional strain this may place on both future practice trainees and law practices seeking to offer practice training contracts."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00372,2023-11-07-T-012,372,Rahayu Mahzam,"MinLaw is working closely with the SILE and the Law Society on these concerns. Areas that we are looking into include arrangements for leave days and medical leave, and renumeration for practice trainees commensurate with their contributions during their training period."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00373,2023-11-07-T-012,373,Rahayu Mahzam,"Another amendment relates to providing trainees the option to practise provisionally under supervision. Clause 12 introduces a framework for “Provisional Practising Certificates”, or provisional PC. A lawyer (NP) who is a practice trainee may apply for a provisional PC after completing at least six months of practice training."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00374,2023-11-07-T-012,374,Rahayu Mahzam,"This will replace the existing “part-call” regime, which only permits practice trainees to have restricted rights of audience to appear and plead before the Courts. The provisional PC provides exposure to a broader variety of experiences that more closely reflect the realities and rigours of private practice."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00375,2023-11-07-T-012,375,Rahayu Mahzam,"A practice trainee who has a provisional PC will be able to undertake work that a practising A&S may do – for example, appear and plead in Court, and render legal advice to clients – provided this is done under the supervision of his or her supervising solicitor."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00376,2023-11-07-T-012,376,Rahayu Mahzam,This will contribute to building a stronger foundation for young lawyers who are starting their legal careers and can provide a smoother transition to independent practice.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00377,2023-11-07-T-012,377,Rahayu Mahzam,"Clause 12 also sets out the power of the Attorney-General, the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and the Council of the Law Society of Singapore in respect of the issue of provisional PCs and the imposition of any further conditions thereof. It also sets out when an application for a provisional PC may be refused, and when a provisional PC may be suspended or cancelled."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00378,2023-11-07-T-012,378,Rahayu Mahzam,"Provision is also made for appeals against the Registrar’s decisions in provisional PC applications, and to introduce measures concerning a lawyer (NP)’s fitness to practise provisionally and when a lawyer (NP) is disqualified from applying for a provisional PC. These are substantively similar to the corresponding provisions in the LPA concerning PCs and A&Ses."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00379,2023-11-07-T-012,379,Rahayu Mahzam,"The next amendment in the Bill provides flexibility for practice trainees to complete up to three months of their practice training at approved in-house legal departments of approved non-law practice entities. This expands the training options for practice trainees and can add to their breadth of practical and commercial experience, so that they are better able to meet the needs of the businesses."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00380,2023-11-07-T-012,380,Rahayu Mahzam,"To ensure that these practice trainees receive proper supervision and training within the in-house legal department, an approved non-law practice entity must be of a minimum size and handle a reasonable amount of Singapore law-related work. The SILE, in consultation with the working group, is working through the applicable criteria. These criteria will be prescribed in the subsidiary legislation."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00381,2023-11-07-T-012,381,Rahayu Mahzam,"A further amendment relates to the moratorium for practice training contract applications. At present, the search for practice training contracts is highly competitive. MinLaw has received feedback that law students feel pressured to start competing with their peers for practice training contracts from as early as their first year in law school."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00382,2023-11-07-T-012,382,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Committee recommended a moratorium period, before which law students cannot apply for practice training contracts and law practices cannot offer them. This would alleviate the law students’ anxieties in the practice training contract application process. Further details on the moratorium’s implementation will be announced in due course. This includes when the moratorium will be introduced, its duration, the relevant criteria for compliance, and the consequences of any breach. The Bill amends the Act to provide flexibility to implement these details in the future."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00383,2023-11-07-T-012,383,Rahayu Mahzam,"The next set of amendments relate to interim disciplinary provisions. Clauses 25 provides that lawyers (NP) are officers of the Supreme Court. Just like A&Ses, lawyers (NP) will be subject to the disciplinary proceedings framework in Part 7 of the Act."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00384,2023-11-07-T-012,384,Rahayu Mahzam,"In this regard, MinLaw is currently conducting a broader review of the Act’s disciplinary proceedings framework as a whole, with a view towards further legislative amendments in the future. This review takes into account recent developments in the case law, as well as feedback from various stakeholders on the Act’s existing provisions. In doing so, MinLaw aims to ensure that the law is clear, that disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are conducted expeditiously and fairly, and that the Act continues to engender public trust in the legal profession."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00385,2023-11-07-T-012,385,Rahayu Mahzam,"This review is complex. Members who are lawyers will appreciate how the Act’s various discipline-related provisions are inter-connected. MinLaw will require more time to complete the review, including consulting relevant stakeholders."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00386,2023-11-07-T-012,386,Rahayu Mahzam,"In the meantime, clauses 26 to 31 of the Bill insert interim provisions for the discipline of lawyers (NP). These interim provisions are based on today’s existing provisions for the discipline of non-practising A&Ses, practice trainees and “part-called” individuals, with adjustments where appropriate. The substance of these interim provisions are subject to change, pending the completion of the review."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00387,2023-11-07-T-012,387,Rahayu Mahzam,"The amendment at clause 48 of the Bill contains transitional arrangements to implement the changes. As announced by my Ministry earlier in February this year, the new admission framework will take effect from the 2024 session of the Part B Bar Examinations onwards."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00388,2023-11-07-T-012,388,Rahayu Mahzam,"Individuals who became qualified persons before 1 November 2023 may apply for admission to the Singapore Bar under the current admission framework, if they meet the current requirements and apply for admission as an A&S before the 2024 session of the Part B Examinations."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00389,2023-11-07-T-012,389,Rahayu Mahzam,"We recognise, however, that some individuals may become qualified persons between 1 November 2023 and 31 January 2024, and are able to complete six months of practice training before the new admission framework is implemented in 2024. They will be able to apply for admission as an A&S under the current admission framework if they pass the Part B examinations by a date prescribed in subsidiary legislation. This prescribed date will be in the second half of 2025."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00390,2023-11-07-T-012,390,Rahayu Mahzam,This Bill also makes miscellaneous and technical amendments to the Act and clarifies certain provisions based on stakeholders’ feedback. I will highlight two such amendments.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00391,2023-11-07-T-012,391,Rahayu Mahzam,"The first clarifies the Court’s powers in an application to be admitted to the Singapore Bar, after the recent incidents of individuals cheating during the Part B examinations. The Court may, considering the applicant’s conduct, character and other relevant circumstances  (a)	adjourn the application for a specified period; (b)	allow it to be withdrawn; or (c)	make any other appropriate order."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00392,2023-11-07-T-012,392,Rahayu Mahzam,"The second clarifies that a Court of 3 Supreme Court Judges constituted under the Act may conduct or hear a matter through electronic means, unless otherwise prescribed. Similar amendments pertaining to the Supreme Court, State Courts, and Family Justice Courts were made via the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021. This amendment is clarificatory in nature and does not introduce new powers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00393,2023-11-07-T-012,393,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the amendments that I have mentioned are part of our efforts to lift the overall standards of the professional training regime for lawyers to develop a future-ready legal workforce."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00394,2023-11-07-T-012,394,Rahayu Mahzam,"Our operating environment has become more complex and competitive. It remains a top priority to empower our law graduates to build themselves a sustainable and fulfilling career, by offering a breadth of opportunities to them in the legal services sector."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00395,2023-11-07-T-012,395,Rahayu Mahzam,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00396,2023-11-07-T-012,396,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00397,2023-11-07-T-012,397,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, to properly understand the reasons for the proposed amendments to the Legal Profession Act 1966, or LPA, that we are considering today, it is important to appreciate the genesis of the process."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00398,2023-11-07-T-012,398,Murali Pillai,"It began with the key idea of a reminder to all of us who live under the rule of law – that law is a profession, not an occupation, in that lawyers must strive to serve the public interest."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00399,2023-11-07-T-012,399,Murali Pillai,"As was mentioned by the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary just now, in 2016, the honourable Chief Justice, established the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers (CPTL) headed by the honourable Justice Quentin Loh to “conduct a root-and-branch review of the professional training regime for trainee lawyers”."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00400,2023-11-07-T-012,400,Murali Pillai,"Some of the drivers for this review were  one, the fast-changing legal environment which required lawyers to work collaboratively over borders; two, the advent of Artificial Intelligence that have the potential to redefine the role of lawyers and the provision of legal services to clients; and three, the increasing savviness of clients; particularly corporate clients."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00401,2023-11-07-T-012,401,Murali Pillai,"The focus was to identify, and I quote, ""measures to strengthen the entire professional training regime such that the quality of training remains robust”."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00402,2023-11-07-T-012,402,Murali Pillai,What is key is that training is not to be understood as merely the development of professional skills. The CPTL emphasised the need to teach trainees the deeper purpose associated with acquiring the skills.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00403,2023-11-07-T-012,403,Murali Pillai,"If law is a profession and if lawyers have a duty to serve the public, then trainees must be imbued with important values such as compassion, courage and commitment to serve justice and integrity."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00404,2023-11-07-T-012,404,Murali Pillai,"The honourable the Chief Justice put this point across poignantly in his speech in 2016 when he announced the set-up of CPTL. His Honour stated as follows, and I quote  “Law is not the only choice for those who have managed to secure a ""fistful of ""As"", as one interview put it to us…If it is the lure of financial rewards that draws you, you should look at other options or be prepared for disappointment."""
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00405,2023-11-07-T-012,405,Murali Pillai,"I wish to pick up one point that was left unsaid but, nonetheless, clear to everyone who is familiar with the developments then. The quality of our lawyers determines the quality of our Judiciary. Hence, ensuring the quality of our young lawyers, not just in terms of skills and knowledge but values, will have an impact, over time, on the quality of our Judiciary which, we all recognise, is an important and co-equal pillar in our Westminster-styled Government."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00406,2023-11-07-T-012,406,Murali Pillai,"Maintaining the quality of the Judiciary is a national imperative. And I need only quote the hon Minister for Law who, in 2018, said in this House  ""When the quality of the Judiciary suffers, the rule of law suffers. When the rule of law suffers, the country suffers""."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00407,2023-11-07-T-012,407,Murali Pillai,"It was in that context, that the CPTL made three key structural recommendations in 2018 which the Government subsequently accepted. They are  (a) lengthening the practice training period from six months to a year; (b) raising the standard and stringency of the bar exams known as ""Part B examinations""; and (c) uncoupling the admission to the Bar from the completion of practice training contracts."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00408,2023-11-07-T-012,408,Murali Pillai,I support these recommendations but have a few queries on the recommendations which I will deal with in turn.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00409,2023-11-07-T-012,409,Murali Pillai,"On the lengthening of the practice training period, the CPTL, in its report, identified two main reasons to recommend the doubling of the training period. In the new regime, each trainee would be required to rotate to contrasting practice areas to gain more exposure. In fact, they may even be seconded to a company as internal counsel for up to three months."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00410,2023-11-07-T-012,410,Murali Pillai,"Also, it was felt that a six-month period was too short for a trainee to develop an aptitude to deal with the pressures of practice once he/she is called to the bar. This was, in fact, a point that was raised by junior lawyers in a focus group discussion that CPTL conducted."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00411,2023-11-07-T-012,411,Murali Pillai,"The CPTL further noted that, from a comparative study, that the training period in Singapore is much shorter than that of barristers and solicitors in the United Kingdom (UK), Hong Kong, Australia and several other countries. Quite clearly though, the key outcome we are looking at is not just the length of the training, but the quality of the lawyer who emerges from it."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00412,2023-11-07-T-012,412,Murali Pillai,"And this outcome depends largely on the supervising solicitors. This was a point that was specifically highlighted by the CPTL. I am aware that, already, there is a checklist that the trainees would have to tick off against, to ensure that they get the requisite exposure. I also note that the CPTL has made recommendations, such as ""training the trainer"" courses, designating a ""training partner"" in firms with six or more lawyers and so on. Furthermore, supervising solicitors' responsibilities are also spelt out under the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00413,2023-11-07-T-012,413,Murali Pillai,"May I please ask the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary  what redress can we provide to trainees who are not getting the exposure, training and mentorship that they are supposed to get from their supervising solicitors?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00414,2023-11-07-T-012,414,Murali Pillai,"Anecdotally, there are cases of trainees not getting the requisite exposure from their supervising solicitors. At the same time, they are naturally concerned about the possible impact on their own career should they raise issue about such matters to their firm. I would be grateful for the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary's response to this matter."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00415,2023-11-07-T-012,415,Murali Pillai,"Next, Sir, the practice trainees who are subscribed to longer training periods, will naturally be concerned about their remuneration for this extended period. Instead of getting lawyers' salaries, they will continue to get allowances for an extended period. At the same time, law practices currently are not allowed to charge clients for the work done by their practice trainees, under the supervision of their supervising solicitors."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00416,2023-11-07-T-012,416,Murali Pillai,"This will mean that law practices will have to incur higher costs, should they increase the allowances to be paid to practice trainees."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00417,2023-11-07-T-012,417,Murali Pillai,"The CPTL encouraged a review of this position, so that law practices will be able to defray the costs associated with a longer practice training period. May I ask if the Government supports the CPTL's position in this regard, and if so, when will the requisite amendments to the subsidiary legislation to allow law practices to charge for their trainees' work, be in place?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00418,2023-11-07-T-012,418,Murali Pillai,"This is not a matter of making profits for the firms, but really a point of fairness – if the trainees are doing work that add value to the client, the client should be willing to pay for it and the firm should be allowed to charge. The key is to create such a market with full transparency."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00419,2023-11-07-T-012,419,Murali Pillai,"Next, on CPTL's recommendation that the standard and stringency of the Part B examinations be raised, I understand that this is an issue that is receiving the attention of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education, which is a Statutory Board set up under the LPA."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00420,2023-11-07-T-012,420,Murali Pillai,"In its report, the CPTL highlighted that the pass rate for the Singapore bar exams between 2010 to 2016, which stands at 99%, compares very favourably with the pass rates in the Bar exam in England, which is about 70%, and the New York Bar, which is about 70% too."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00421,2023-11-07-T-012,421,Murali Pillai,"I accept that the standards of the Bar exam must be sufficiently high to ensure that persons who pass, have an adequate standard of academic quality. On the other hand, we must guard against the tendency to make the Bar exam harder than necessary. Otherwise, our young talents will miss the chance of being developed into lawyers and, ultimately, Singapore will be the loser."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00422,2023-11-07-T-012,422,Murali Pillai,"I have also noted some disquiet, expressed particularly in the social media amongst persons sitting for the Part B exam, who noted that the breadth of subjects being introduced for the Part B course are very wide and include specialist law areas. In addition, there is a concern that bell curve grading will be introduced for Part B exams."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00423,2023-11-07-T-012,423,Murali Pillai,"I seek the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary's views on how it is proposed that a proper balance be struck in these circumstances. Here, we must be clear about the specific outcome that we want to achieve – it is not whether the 99% pass rate, on its own, is too high, or that 70% is too low. It is whether law graduates who pass the Part B examinations will be lawyers who can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with lawyers across the world and possess the competence to discharge their responsibilities well."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00424,2023-11-07-T-012,424,Murali Pillai,"On CPTL's third structural recommendation of uncoupling the admission to bar from completion of practice training contracts, I have an observation to make. I note that it is proposed that a non-practicing lawyer, in addition to be being admitted to the Roll of Lawyers, be also members of the Law Society. Notwithstanding that they can be members of the Law Society, only practitioner members may be elected to the Council of the Law Society."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00425,2023-11-07-T-012,425,Murali Pillai,"I am aware that there are other professional bodies which allow non-practising members to be elected into their respective councils. In my respectful view, given the unique duties of the Law Society as set out under the LPA, it is correct to continue to rely on practitioner members, with the requisite knowledge and experience, to be responsible for managing the affairs of the Law Society and ensuring that the Society discharges its statutory functions under the LPA properly."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00426,2023-11-07-T-012,426,Murali Pillai,"Nonetheless, given that it is now to be statutorily provided that non-practicing lawyers may be Law Society members, there will be a need for the Law Society to cater to their interests too. In addition, there is an opportunity for the Law Society to harness the energies and abilities of these new members in discharging its responsibilities. I express the hope that the Law Society members from all categories will be able to work together for the collective good of the legal community and, of course, our country."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00427,2023-11-07-T-012,427,Murali Pillai,"I now deal with the miscellaneous amendments proposed in the Bill on the process issues. First, I turn to the proposal to issue practice trainees with provisional practicing certificates, authorising him or her to practise provisionally after they have served six months of traineeship."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00428,2023-11-07-T-012,428,Murali Pillai,"I support the proposal. I note that the intention is to allow the practice trainee to do anything that an advocate and solicitor can do, provided that they are under the supervision of a supervising solicitor. The period of coverage is not just during the practice training period, but also after the training period, but before he or she is admitted as an advocate and solicitor."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00429,2023-11-07-T-012,429,Murali Pillai,"A significant difference between the proposal and the current regime involving part-called lawyers is that the period during which practice trainees can practise, with provisional practising certificates is proposed to be doubled. Currently, advocates and solicitors, before they can apply for a practising certificate, will have to take out a malpractice insurance under the Legal Profession (Professional Indemnity Insurance) Rules."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00430,2023-11-07-T-012,430,Murali Pillai,"May I ask if there are similar requirements for practice trainees applying for provisional practising certificates to take out insurance? If not, what steps will be put in place to ensure that there is an indemnity insurance in place, covering civil liability arising from the acts or omissions of practice trainees with provisional practicing certificates? Also, would law practices be required to pay extra premiums as a result of this arrangement?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00431,2023-11-07-T-012,431,Murali Pillai,"Next, and finally, I turn to professional training of Judicial Service or Legal Service Officers. Currently, different training periods apply to law graduates who seek admission to the Bar by working as an officer in judicial service, legal service or the Public Defender's Office."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00432,2023-11-07-T-012,432,Murali Pillai,"For them, six months of working as a judicial service officer (JSO) or legal service officer (LSO) is equivalent to one month of supervised training by a practice trainee in private practice. In other words, it typically takes three years for a JSO or LSO to complete the equivalent of six months' traineeship by a practice trainee, before he or she may be called to the Bar."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00433,2023-11-07-T-012,433,Murali Pillai,"If memory serves me correctly, I believe this requirement was first imposed in the early 1990s as part of a talent retention programme. I note from the CPTL report that it is proposed that the practice training period for law graduates who are serving as officers be equalised with practice trainees who serve their practice training period in Singapore law practices."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00434,2023-11-07-T-012,434,Murali Pillai,"As a matter of principle, I support the parity, but may I please ask what is the Government's position on this matter, and if the Government accepts the CPTL's recommendation, may I ask how it proposes to deal with the original objective that led to the implementation of the different training periods for these officers in the first place?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00435,2023-11-07-T-012,435,Murali Pillai,"Sir, the proposed amendments under the LPA help underline the important principle that lawyers must not only know the law, but ""why"" they are lawyers. How we train lawyers cannot be a mere technicality or a mere process of mastering the practice of law, but must be a careful and continuous appreciation of the solemn obligations placed on all lawyers, as officers of the Court, to uphold the rule of law and conduct themselves as members of an honourable profession. I support the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00436,2023-11-07-T-012,436,Speaker,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00437,2023-11-07-T-012,437,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer. The proposed amendments have the effect not only of changing certain aspects of new lawyers' training regime, but also restructures the legal profession by introducing a new category ""lawyer (non-practitioner)"", or lawyer (NP). I would like to seek a few clarifications on the amendments."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00438,2023-11-07-T-012,438,Raj Joshua Thomas,"First, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify what exactly a lawyer (NP), who is not pursuing a practice training, is qualified to do. For example, would the lawyer (NP) designation be the required minimum, in order for a person to be an in-house legal counsel in Singapore?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00439,2023-11-07-T-012,439,Raj Joshua Thomas,"The lawyer (NP) designation may also confuse members of the public as to whether these persons are able to provide legal advice or to act legally for them, which remains the preserve of advocates and solicitors holding a practicing certificate. In this regard, I urge the Ministry to take steps to ensure public communications to equip members of the public to be able to tell the difference."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00440,2023-11-07-T-012,440,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Second, I note that the Ministry intends to now allow, via subsidiary legislation, up to three months of a practice training contract to be completed at approved in-house legal departments of approved corporations. I support the spirit of this move, as it would give aspiring advocates and solicitors good exposure to the work in corporations that would contribute to a more well-rounded training experience."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00441,2023-11-07-T-012,441,Raj Joshua Thomas,"However, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary provide some clarity on the approval process for these corporations and in-house legal departments? Furthermore, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary also clarify how lawyers (NP), and the law firms they are training with, would have access to these three-month attachments?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00442,2023-11-07-T-012,442,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Would the approved corporations have the ability to choose which trainees to accept? And I hope that the system will ensure fair access to trainees from all firms  small, medium and large. We should avoid a system where trainees at larger firms have a higher chance of being involved in these attachments, just by virtue of being at these firms, and those from smaller firms are being prejudiced."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00443,2023-11-07-T-012,443,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Third, I would like to ask if the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary could provide some clarity on how the moratorium for practice training contract applications, also to be given effect by subsidiary legislation, would operate."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00444,2023-11-07-T-012,444,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, I am concerned about the impact that these changes may have on smaller law firms of 30 and less practitioners. The longer training period means that law firms that take on trainees will not be likely to charge for their trainees' work for a longer duration. Clients of smaller firms, with generally tighter budgets, may not be amendable to paying for trainees' time, costs or for their work, although their new designation of lawyer (NP) may be persuasive to some extent. So, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary give some clarity as to whether the time and cost of trainees could be charged to clients?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00445,2023-11-07-T-012,445,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Furthermore, with a longer training period, trainees may expect higher allowances, because their higher full-time fee earner salaries will be pushed back now by six months. This may be difficult for smaller law firms to swallow. As I mentioned earlier, the three-month attachments, as part of a training practice contract, could also end up being prejudicial to smaller law firms, if the corporations can and do pick primarily brand name law firms from which to accept trainees."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00446,2023-11-07-T-012,446,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Based on a SingStat report in 2018, 97% of law practices in Singapore have 30 and less practitioners. Their value-added contribution, however, was only 38%, while the 3% of larger firms, contributed to 62% of value add."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00447,2023-11-07-T-012,447,Raj Joshua Thomas,"This House has made several changes, including those before the House today, to the legal profession over the past few years, in order to position the industry for the future. These changes must not only benefit the 3% of large firms, but also help to unlock the latent value in the other 97% which would significantly increase the overall value add of the legal industry to the Singapore economy."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00448,2023-11-07-T-012,448,Raj Joshua Thomas,"In this regard, I trust that the Ministry will continue to ensure that the benefits of the changes to the profession are equally accessible by lawyers in smaller firms as well as in large firms. Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I support the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00449,2023-11-07-T-012,449,Speaker,Mr Lim Biow Chuan.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00450,2023-11-07-T-012,450,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer. Sir, I understand that this Bill introduces amendments which were based on the recommendations of the CPTL. I too have a few queries on the amendment Bill for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00451,2023-11-07-T-012,451,Lim Biow Chuan,"First is the length of time to qualify to be a practising lawyer. According to MinLaw's announcement made when the amendment Bill was read for the first time, the Legal Profession Act regulations would be amended to lengthen the practice training period from six months to one year."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00452,2023-11-07-T-012,452,Lim Biow Chuan,"This means that in future, any aspiring lawyer would now have to undergo four years of academic study to obtain a law degree, spend six months preparing for the Part B examination and then spend one year on a practice training period – a total of five-and-a-half years."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00453,2023-11-07-T-012,453,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I urge the Government to consider that not every law student comes from a wealthy background. For an aspiring lawyer who comes from a poor family, the additional six months on a practice training contract would impose additional financial constraint on the family. It may also deter those who have the right attitude, skillset or talent from taking up law as a career because of the length of time required."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00454,2023-11-07-T-012,454,Lim Biow Chuan,"For some students, a delay in six months may mean nothing. But for a law student from a poorer background, that delay of six months would mean an inability to contribute to the household expenses of the family. It will cause more hardship for the family. And if the student has to repay study loans, this would also mean a delay in the repayment of the study loan."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00455,2023-11-07-T-012,455,Lim Biow Chuan,"Thus, an additional six months' extension of the training period may have different implications on a law student depending on his or her family circumstances. Has MinLaw considered the fact that lengthening the practice training period by a further six months may cause financial hardship on law students? It may also create the impression that all aspiring lawyers must have deep financial means."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00456,2023-11-07-T-012,456,Lim Biow Chuan,"Next, Sir, I want to talk about quality of training. I recognise that the CPTL wanted to lengthen the training period so as to allow a longer period of mentorship to acquire basic legal skills. It also allows the mentor lawyer a longer period to assess the trainee lawyer."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00457,2023-11-07-T-012,457,Lim Biow Chuan,"Currently, there is no structure for the training contract. The SILE does provide guidelines but whether the trainee receives proper training very much depends on the law firm and the supervising lawyer. If a supervising lawyer behaves unethically, then the trainee maybe be learning the wrong behaviour about a lawyer's conduct."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00458,2023-11-07-T-012,458,Lim Biow Chuan,"Two years ago, there was a case about a lawyer who took on the role of being a supervising lawyer when he was not qualified to do so. And according to the judgment by Justice Choo Han Teck, the lawyer may have supervised another trainee who have since been admitted to the Bar. In other words, that person who had been admitted to the Bar had received training from a supervising lawyer who was not qualified to do so. Justice Choo had then said in the judgment that the Supervising Authorities should pursue the matter."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00459,2023-11-07-T-012,459,Lim Biow Chuan,"Thus, Sir, even if the training contract is for one year and not six months, whether the trainee receives adequate supervision and training during this training period depends very much on the experience and ability of the supervising solicitor. And even then, the supervising solicitor must have the time to teach or guide the trainee. Otherwise, the trainee may not benefit from a training contract, whether it is for six months or one year."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00460,2023-11-07-T-012,460,Lim Biow Chuan,"Third, Sir, I want to talk about admission of lawyers (NP). Clause 6 of the Amendment Bill provides for a new category of individuals to be admitted to the Singapore Bar as a lawyer (NP)."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00461,2023-11-07-T-012,461,Lim Biow Chuan,"My query is on the use of the term ""lawyer (NP)"". Generally, the term ""lawyer"" is meant to apply to those whose profession is to conduct lawsuits on behalf of clients and to advise as to their legal rights and obligations. For the non-practising lawyers, they are generally known as legal counsel."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00462,2023-11-07-T-012,462,Lim Biow Chuan,"By adding a category of the term ""lawyer (NP)"", would members of the public be able to distinguish between a lawyer in active practice and a lawyer (NP) who, in the past would be called a legal counsel?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00463,2023-11-07-T-012,463,Lim Biow Chuan,May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary which other jurisdictions has a similar term as lawyer (NP)? Would members of the public then feel that lawyers (NP) would be in a position to advise the clients on legal practice matters when they are not really legal practitioners?
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00464,2023-11-07-T-012,464,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I do not, in any way, mean to suggest that legal counsels are less regarded as compared to lawyers. But it is important to distinguish the primary function of lawyers and that of legal counsel. They are separate as they advise different parties."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00465,2023-11-07-T-012,465,Lim Biow Chuan,"Further, if this law is passed, would all the existing legal counsels be able to apply to be admitted to the Bar as lawyers (NP)?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00466,2023-11-07-T-012,466,Lim Biow Chuan,"If so, would there be a large number of applicants because currently, there are many legal counsels who are working in corporate organisations advising their companies. What would the process be like in dealing with such applications?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00467,2023-11-07-T-012,467,Lim Biow Chuan,"Finally, Sir, let me address Part B of the course. From the Report by the CPTL, I understand that there is an intention to make Part B more vigorous. I have received a lot of feedback from existing students that the academic workload for Part B is worse than the law school examinations."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00468,2023-11-07-T-012,468,Lim Biow Chuan,I took a look at the course content at the SILE website and I was surprised by the large number of subjects that are covered. It was as if SILE was trying to squeeze in a few years of legal content into a five- or six-month Part B course.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00469,2023-11-07-T-012,469,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, in the past, the Practice Law Course, which is the current Part B, was meant to ensure that law students have sufficient knowledge of the practical aspect of legal practice before they are allowed to practise as advocates and solicitors. And that learning journey is always ongoing, because it is impossible to know everything as a lawyer. The law school examination is meant to give the student academic knowledge of a particular areas of law and the Practice Law Course is to supplement that knowledge in terms of the legal practice."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00470,2023-11-07-T-012,470,Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I am of the view that we ought to maintain the intent of the Part B which is to impart practical skills to the aspiring lawyer and it is not meant to sieve out those who have no interest in the practice of law. If a student has passed his or her examinations and graduated with a law degree, MinLaw should accept that that student does have the requisite academic legal knowledge. Otherwise, that person should not have obtained the law degree. Making Part B more difficult would merely add on the stress of being a lawyer when the legal profession is currently suffering from a shortage of lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00471,2023-11-07-T-012,471,Lim Biow Chuan,I hope that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary can clarify my queries.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00472,2023-11-07-T-012,472,Speaker,Assoc Prof Razwana.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00473,2023-11-07-T-012,473,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00474,2023-11-07-T-012,474,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Sir, the rule of law is fundamental to Singapore's prosperity. A robust and effective legal system provides a stable environment for our nation's governance and growth and is one of the futures that gives Singapore its ongoing international reputation as a safe, credible and trustworthy country."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00475,2023-11-07-T-012,475,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Lawyers play a vital role in upholding the rule of law, defending rights of individuals and ensuring access to justice for all."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00476,2023-11-07-T-012,476,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,The proposal amendments in this Bill align with the recommendations of the CPTL. The Committee's underlying objectives are to ensure equitable access to professional training for trainee lawyers and to enhance the quality of their training.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00477,2023-11-07-T-012,477,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"This guarantees that future lawyers are not technically skilled but are also valued driven and embody compassion, continuous learning, excellence and a commitment to Public Service."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00478,2023-11-07-T-012,478,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"The suggested changes aim to foster a legal profession that is both effective and compassionate, with lawyers who carry out their duties guided by principles and accountability and are firmly grounded in ethical practice."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00479,2023-11-07-T-012,479,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"With that understanding, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of the changes, I do have some clarifications and suggestions."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00480,2023-11-07-T-012,480,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Before I do so, however, I would like to declare my position as an educator with Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and to note that many of the concerns raised in my speech are based on my engagement and discussion with students, university colleagues, legal practitioners and users of Legal Services."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00481,2023-11-07-T-012,481,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, my first set of comments related to the proposed amendments to Part B of the syllabus and the extension of the practice training period and how these changes will impact qualified persons seeking admission as advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00482,2023-11-07-T-012,482,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"I understand that Part B syllabus has been restructured, requiring candidates to complete more modules on different subjects."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00483,2023-11-07-T-012,483,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"The expansion in the number of subjects in Part B syllabus reflects a commitment to providing a comprehensive legal education to qualified persons aspiring to practise law. It also acknowledges that the law is a multi-faceted field, touching on various aspects of society, from business and technology, to constitutional rights and environmental concerns. By offering a broader range of subjects, candidates will gain a broader perspective of the law and its intersection with other disciplines."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00484,2023-11-07-T-012,484,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"However, this broad-based approach needs to be considered in tandem with the practicality of the teaching methodology and the opportunity to observe all this new information. Though most candidates appreciate the opportunity to learn and be exposed to a variety of subjects, we need to maintain our focus on the critical skills required for candidates to become competent lawyers and be cautious of knowledge overload."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00485,2023-11-07-T-012,485,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"In light of this, could be review the subjects offered in Part B and consider allowing candidates to select courses in areas of their interests. Doing so could assist to manage knowledge overload while still providing candidates with the opportunity to develop critical skills."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00486,2023-11-07-T-012,486,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, in the ever-evolving legal landscapes, lawyers must embrace continuous learning to stay abreast of the dynamic changes within the field. On that note and in the context of our national emphasis on lifelong learning, could candidates, once admitted, have the option to select certain broad-based courses as part of their ongoing professional development?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00487,2023-11-07-T-012,487,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Related, I would like to share that several candidates completing Part B course have commented that they would welcome greater interaction and engagement with senior lawyers. Accordingly, could we explore the possibility of providing mentorship and guidance for candidates at an earlier stage of their Part B education, similar to the Law Society mentorship scheme and in that scheme, supports junior lawyers with less than five years of experience?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00488,2023-11-07-T-012,488,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"My next comment, regarding the impact of these amendments on candidates seeking for admission relate to the extension of the practice training period. Increasing the training period from six to 12 months offers some advantages. It ensures that junior lawyers begin their legal career with a robust foundation, practical experience and a comprehensive grasp of the law. Additionally, it benefits law firms by enabling a thorough assessment of their trainees."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00489,2023-11-07-T-012,489,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Nonetheless, it is essential to contemplate the consequences for both trainees and the law firm that engage them, particularly in terms of associated costs. There are two direct consequences that trainee remain concerned about  low pay is extended to 12 months instead of six months and no paid or sick leave."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00490,2023-11-07-T-012,490,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, at this point, I would like to emphasise the challenges faced by several law students, especially adult learners at SUSS. I would like to relay the feedback from one of our adult learners who is enrolled in the law programme and he is also financially supporting two children attending university. He has indicated the longer duration of the practice training period makes it financially onerous for him to pursue a career as a practising lawyer."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00491,2023-11-07-T-012,491,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Considering the financial constraints that may affect the decision to practise, is there possibility of utilising the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidies to financially support selected trainees during their practice training period?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00492,2023-11-07-T-012,492,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"In addressing the financial challenges and, at the same juncture, to qualify to be called to the Bar, would the Ministry consider offering legal executive positions in public organisations, like the Legal Aid Bureau, Community Law Centre and the Public Defender's Office?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00493,2023-11-07-T-012,493,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"It is reassuring that the practice training period can be carried out within pre-approved in-house legal departments or qualified organisations. This offers a chance for trainees to gain exposure to a variety of legal practices. On that note, may I check with the Ministry on the criteria established in defining the work done as part of the in-house legal departments and how do we assess if a trainee is given the opportunity to rotate within the different legal departments or qualified organisations?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00494,2023-11-07-T-012,494,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,I would now like to talk about the proposed introduction of the provisional practising certificates for trainees.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00495,2023-11-07-T-012,495,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,I applaud the Ministry for including this option for trainees. This will surely expand the scope of work for the trainees and strengthen their capabilities in becoming a confident lawyer.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00496,2023-11-07-T-012,496,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"While enhancing a trainee's practical application of legal knowledge, this proposal also means that firms can now get trainees to do associate work without the trainee receiving the same renumeration as an associate. I understand that a trainee may receive some allowance while doing similar, if not, the same tasks as an associate. I believe if the current amendment is not accompanied with adjustments to the trainees' allowance, practising as lawyers may become less appealing to new entrants."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00497,2023-11-07-T-012,497,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"On that note, may I check if the Ministry would consider advising law firms to provide a standard package for trainees, including benefits like medical and maternity leave, to ensure a fair and consistent experience for trainee lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00498,2023-11-07-T-012,498,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"I would also like to seek clarification on the process for suspension or revocation of provisional practising certificates, and if a trainee does have their professional certificate suspended, are there mandatory causes or relearning procedures for affected trainees?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00499,2023-11-07-T-012,499,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, as an advocate for experiential learning, I believe in the value of extending the practice training period. However, I would like to suggest that we provide options for trainees and take into account the unique needs of affected trainees. While law is frequently characterised as being clear-cut, it is essential to acknowledge the diverse characteristics of trainees who are planning to become practising lawyers. We must consider the nuances aspects of law, the various shades of grey when supporting these trainees, without compromising the necessary knowledge and skills to help them achieve their aspiration and goals as competent and responsible lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00500,2023-11-07-T-012,500,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, I would now like to move away from candidates and trainees and talk about the impact of the amendments on the law firms."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00501,2023-11-07-T-012,501,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"While extending the training programme from six to 12 months may allow additional time for law firms to assess and evaluate trainees and may enable continuity of services for the firms' clients, the longer duration may result in a reduced number of contracts being offered or being available to trainees. Considering the potential reduction in the number of contracts offered, will the Ministry encourage law firms to expand their offer of practice training contracts or provide incentives for them to do so?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00502,2023-11-07-T-012,502,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, the last group we must consider is the end user. The legal profession in Singapore plays a pivotal role in preserving peace and justice. Its function in upholding the rule of law, offering access to justice and resolving disputes are essential in guaranteeing the continued fairness and orderliness of the Singaporean society."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00503,2023-11-07-T-012,503,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"The amendment that proposes uncoupling admission to the bar from the completion of practice training offers a choice to law graduates and may assist retaining them in the legal field. However, it may also inadvertently lead to a decline in the number of graduates becoming practising lawyers. This may result in fewer lawyers taking on matters related to the needs of the community such as family or criminal law-related cases."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00504,2023-11-07-T-012,504,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"It is crucial for lawyers to comprehend the challenges their clients face. Lawyers should actively explore methods for mediation and conflict resolution, when necessary, rather than rushing to push the cases into the courtroom. This approach helps foster a legal system that is more accessible, empathetic and focused on finding just resolutions for the benefit of all involved."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00505,2023-11-07-T-012,505,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"On that note, is there any consideration for lawyers to receive education on more relational theory of justice such as restorative justice? If I may explain, according to the United Nation (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime, and I quote, ""restorative justice refers to a way of responding to crime or to the types of wrongdoing, injustice or conflict that focuses primarily on repairing the damage caused by the wrongful action and restoring as in so far as possible the well-being of those involved"". I believe such topics would enhance the ability of lawyers to provide quality advice aligned to the needs of their clients."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00506,2023-11-07-T-012,506,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"Sir, the proposed amendments in this Bill represent a constructive move towards establishing regulation that can foster the development of dependable and ethical lawyers, thus contributing to a more equitable, ethical and inclusive society that serves both the legal profession and the broader community. In conclusion, notwithstanding the clarifications and suggestions I have raised earlier, I stand in support of this amendment Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00507,2023-11-07-T-012,507,Speaker,Mr Patrick Tay.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00508,2023-11-07-T-012,508,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as Director, Legal, of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, and Honorary Member and Board of Advisors to Singapore Corporate Counsel Association."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00509,2023-11-07-T-012,509,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The Bill before us today seeks to amend the Legal Profession Act, with the key objective of strengthening the professional training regime for lawyers in Singapore and to better equip law graduates with the relevant skills and competencies to meet the demands of our changing economy."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00510,2023-11-07-T-012,510,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I would like to highlight two key changes  first, lengthening the practice training period (PTP) from six months to one year; and second, permitting up to three months of the practice training contract to be completed at approved in-house legal departments of approved corporations."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00511,2023-11-07-T-012,511,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The purpose of lengthening the PTP is to provide trainee lawyers with a longer runway to pick up, grasp and hone their skills to be better lawyers. While the intent is a noble one, this must be balanced against the adverse financial impacts borne by the trainee lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00512,2023-11-07-T-012,512,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First, the financial impact of the prolonged PTP on trainees. Trainee lawyers typically work long hours, from an early start till late into the night and also on weekends. From the postings online and from the trainees I spoke to, they are paid monthly allowances or honorariums of between S$1,000 or S$2,500 each month during the PTP. Some firms offer training contracts with only a pittance as an allowance, which I opine can be seen as exploitative. This pales in comparison to their peers or fresh graduates in other industries, who draw between S$3,500 or S$5,000, depending on the industry, each month and work lesser hours than these trainees."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00513,2023-11-07-T-012,513,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The trainees are neither less qualified nor less capable than any of their peers in other industries. Indeed, many have gone through rigorous curriculums in the law schools and learnt much in preparation for the law and bar exams. They have to push on against all odds as they need it to be called to the bar. And one can say that a new lawyer’s pay goes up significantly upon their call, but the skills and abilities have not suddenly nor exponentially increased."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00514,2023-11-07-T-012,514,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"While I understand that trainee lawyers should not be driven solely by financial rewards, and that the quantum for the monthly honorarium or allowance is largely driven by market forces, it is nonetheless important for them to be paid fairly, in recognition of their skills and contributions to the firms. The trainees provide valuable contributions to the firm, in terms of research on novel points of the law and preparation of the initial drafts, which are used to advance the client’s case. This also helps lighten the lawyers’ loads."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00515,2023-11-07-T-012,515,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"To that end, is there more that can be done to ensure our trainees are paid reasonably, especially during the lengthened PTP? How can we encourage firms to pay more in terms of the monthly allowance? How can the bigger firms also pay more for those on training contracts, as they currently set the de facto upper limit? How can we help those from lower-income families, who may need the income to support their families? In the same vein, how can we ensure better retention in the legal industry?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00516,2023-11-07-T-012,516,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, mandating certain benefits, including paid sick leave, to be provided under training contracts. In my recent interactions with trainees, many have expressed their concerns about the lack of paid sick leave and annual leave, especially with the prolonged PTP period. People do fall ill and are required to rest to be more productive."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00517,2023-11-07-T-012,517,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Sir, the past three years, we battled multiple waves of COVID-19. Apart from COVID-19, there also other strains of flu circulating within our society. As with all other individuals, trainees also fall ill and may require medical attention from time to time."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00518,2023-11-07-T-012,518,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Given that there are some similarities between trainees and employees, it is humbly submitted that paid sick leave should similarly accrue for trainees after three months of employment with a law firm."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00519,2023-11-07-T-012,519,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Under the existing rules, breaks taken during the PTP will be excluded from the computation of the PTP period. There is value in such a rule to ensure that trainees complete the entire training period and reap the full benefits of it, and I recognise that."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00520,2023-11-07-T-012,520,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In view of the above, I am therefore proposing that trainees be accorded paid sick leave when they are unwell, while requiring them to “make-up” for the same number of days at the end of their PTP. In other words, those who fall ill during the PTP will have an extended PTP – reflecting the “make-up period” – but will be paid a larger allowance or honorarium at the end of the PTP, to reflect the paid sick leave accorded."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00521,2023-11-07-T-012,521,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Apart from providing trainees with paid sick leave, it may also be useful to let trainees have paid annual leave. There is a Chinese saying which says "" 休息是为了走更远的路 "". If translated, it means one can accomplish more with adequate rest and breaks along the way. I am really concerned about the overall mental well-being and health of our young trainee lawyers including lawyers in practice. Any positive move and step can better our workers’ welfare and well-being overall."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00522,2023-11-07-T-012,522,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Third, training contracts bear some semblance to employment contracts. Leaving aside the practical concerns that I had highlighted, I noted that there are significant similarities between training contracts and employment contracts, which justify providing certain basic employment benefits, such as paid sick leave, to trainees, which employees under the Employment Act currently enjoy."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00523,2023-11-07-T-012,523,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First, the law firm exercises substantial control over the trainee’s work. Apart from training the trainee, the supervising solicitors or other lawyers in the firm set timelines, guide, review and provide input to the trainee’s work before the same is sent to the client for approval."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00524,2023-11-07-T-012,524,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, the trainee is interviewed by and selected by the law firm, presumably based on the individual’s skills, character and fit, with a view to retain him or her upon the conclusion of the PTP. This contrasts with a contract for services, whereby a particular vendor is engaged to provide general services."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00525,2023-11-07-T-012,525,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Third, the trainee has access to and uses the firm's equipment and resources in the course of his or her work. This includes having access to the firm’s laptop, legal research websites and existing precedents."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00526,2023-11-07-T-012,526,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Fourth, the trainee is remunerated through regular allowance, rather by means of commissions or otherwise."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00527,2023-11-07-T-012,527,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Fifth, some of the practice training contracts stipulate the trainee’s working hours and duration, which contrasts with independent contractors who have flexibility over their schedules."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00528,2023-11-07-T-012,528,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Sixth, the trainee is typically only allowed to work for one employer or law firm at any one point, and should the trainee wish to change firm, he or she must notify SILE beforehand. This is unlike independent contractors who may work for multiple service buyers at the same time."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00529,2023-11-07-T-012,529,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Lastly, if a ""contract of service"" as defined under the Employment Act also includes ""an apprenticeship contract"", a fortiori, a training contract offered to graduates should likewise be classified as a ""contract of service"" with attendant benefits."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00530,2023-11-07-T-012,530,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Given that there is some semblance between training contracts and employment contracts, it is humbly submitted that trainees should likewise be accorded basic employment benefits, such as paid sick leave and annual leave for a start, during the PTP, with other benefits to be considered at a later stage."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00531,2023-11-07-T-012,531,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Finally, I applaud the proposed change of permitting up to three months of the practice training contract to be completed at in-house legal departments of approved corporations. As the “in-house” option is a popular alternative to private practice, having first-hand experience witnessing the operations and needs of a business would give trainees a flavour of the type of work to expect as an in-house legal counsel. Additionally, a short stint in companies would help them be more attuned to the business needs of an organisation and consider matters holistically, instead of looking at matters purely from a legal perspective. I submit that this definition of ""corporations"" extend to other organisations where they have an in-house team such as NTUC. With this, it is hoped that they would be more well-rounded lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00532,2023-11-07-T-012,532,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications and suggestions, I stand in support of the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00533,2023-11-07-T-012,533,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00534,2023-11-07-T-012,534,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, this Bill will strengthen the training of law graduates and better equip them to enter the legal profession."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00535,2023-11-07-T-012,535,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Key amendments introduced include decoupling admission to the Singapore bar from practice training, increasing the practice training period, allowing limited rights to practise after six months’ training and introducing a moratorium for practice training contract applications."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00536,2023-11-07-T-012,536,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have three clarifications to raise.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00537,2023-11-07-T-012,537,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My first set of clarifications relate to the moratorium date on applications for training contracts. The Bill empowers the SILE to disregard any period in calculating the training period completed by a practice trainee. The explanatory statement clarifies that this may include any contravention of the moratorium date on applications for training contracts.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00538,2023-11-07-T-012,538,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify how any breach of the moratorium date will be factored into calculating the training period completed? For instance, will SILE discount the training period completed by the same amount of time that the practice trainee and law firm breached the moratorium? Would SILE consider certain factors as aggravating or mitigating in this calculation? And are there other penalties that practice trainees would face, apart from the discounting of the training period?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00539,2023-11-07-T-012,539,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Second, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share whether law firms may face any penalties if they offer practice training contracts in breach of a law student’s moratorium? It does not appear that this Bill provides for such penalties. If that is the case, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary explain the rationale behind such an omission?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00540,2023-11-07-T-012,540,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,The omission is odd because the Bill's explanatory statement says that a moratorium is meant to be two-prong  it bars law students from making applications and it bars law practices from making offers. It seems inconsistent and unfair to punish only the student if the law firm wittingly makes an offer in breach of the moratorium date.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00541,2023-11-07-T-012,541,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Finally, can Senior Parliamentary Secretary share how the SILE detects breaches of the moratorium? The Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers themselves noted in their recommendation that breaches would be hard to detect. Will there be audits or reporting obligations that enable more effective policing of the moratorium?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00542,2023-11-07-T-012,542,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My second clarification is on the exposure of practice trainees to contrasting practice areas. One reason the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers (CPTL) recommended increasing the practice training period to one year was to allow practice trainees more meaningful exposures to contrasting practice areas. However, small law firms may not be able to provide such exposure, given that their firm's work may be more narrow. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share what efforts will be made to ensure that even practice trainees in small law firms can have meaningful exposure to different practice areas?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00543,2023-11-07-T-012,543,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My third and final clarification is on the salary of practice trainees that many Members have raised. Practice trainees usually receive salaries that are significantly lower than what they would earn as a fully qualified lawyer. For example, it is reported that the Big Four law firms in Singapore pay trainees an honorarium of around $2,000 to $2,500 while their first-year associates now get $7,500 to $7,900. The effect of increasing the practice training period to one year is that practice trainees will earn a lower salary for a longer period."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00544,2023-11-07-T-012,544,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"While the media has reported that some law firms are looking to increase practice trainee salaries, relying on individual law firms' review of practice trainees will likely lead to unequal and inequitable outcomes across the board. Can the Senior Minister of State share what steps will be taken across the board to review practice trainee salaries? Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00545,2023-11-07-T-012,545,Speaker,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00546,2023-11-07-T-012,546,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00547,2023-11-07-T-012,547,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Sir, a 2022 report from the International Bar Association revealed that out of 3,000 lawyers aged 40 and under surveyed around the world, 54% reported that they were somewhat likely or highly likely to move to a new workplace and 20% were thinking about leaving the profession entirely. In Singapore, one in seven junior lawyers stopped practising in 2021."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00548,2023-11-07-T-012,548,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"While unfortunately some prefer to carelessly put this down to zoomers being not as hungry as those in generations before or feeling less pressure to earn an income, to quote the late and great former Law Society president and unofficial King of Singapore according to LinkedIn, Mr Adrian Tan, ""It may be tougher to be a young lawyer now than at any time in history. They work at an intense pace and are on call night and day."""
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00549,2023-11-07-T-012,549,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I remember once getting a request from a client to set up a virtual call quickly at about 1.00 am and, on another occasion, leaving the office around 3.00 am after waiting for a turn of documents from the other counsel, only to come back some three hours later to facilitate a deal signing during an auspicious early morning fengshui hour."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00550,2023-11-07-T-012,550,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Yet, many still want to join the noble profession and numbers grow steadily. Between 2019 and 2021, Singapore saw an average of 394 university graduates obtaining a first degree in law. As of August 2023, the Law Society reports 6,512 practitioners."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00551,2023-11-07-T-012,551,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The CPTL was convened in 2016, as shared by many hon Members earlier, to conduct a review of the professional training regime for trainee lawyers. The Committee outlined various challenges, including intense competition for practice training contracts, perceived unfair recruitment practices and a lack of consistency in training standards across firms."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00552,2023-11-07-T-012,552,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Upon the completion of training contracts, the Committee also found the trend of attrition amongst young lawyers due to unsustainable work practices, unsuitability of the individual for legal work and the absence of alternative pathways. This trend was cast in the spotlight again in 2021."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00553,2023-11-07-T-012,553,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I am heartened by the Government's concern and efforts to work together with industry and schools to improve retention and quality of training. To quote the International Bar Association (IBA) president, ""The young lawyers of today are the senior leaders of tomorrow."""
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00554,2023-11-07-T-012,554,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,I have four clarifications.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00555,2023-11-07-T-012,555,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"First, the extension of the practice training period from six to 12 months. This extension brings us closer to training contracts in some other jurisdictions, for example, 12 months of pupilage in the UK before one practises as a barrister, and 24 months of qualifying work experience in up to four firms for solicitors and 12 months in New South Wales. The extended timeframe, on one hand, gives trainees more time to oversee cases that cannot be completed in six months and grants firms more time to assess performance for a more informed retention decisions based on mutual fit."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00556,2023-11-07-T-012,556,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"However, in my dialogues and engagements with young law students, some have expressed concerns. Given the rising cost of living, coupled with potential debt after university degrees, and another $6,000-plus required for the Part B examinations, some are worried about the quantum of the allowance if the training is lengthened. Figures between $1,000 and $2,500 have been shared as a rough quantum of allowance during practice training. In particular, this can be challenging for adult learners or students facing financial challenges."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00557,2023-11-07-T-012,557,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I, for one, could not have completed my law degree without support from MENDAKI and a Singapore Management University (SMU) scholarship in my first year. It was only after receiving my first pay cheque as a young lawyer after my training could I finally breathe and contribute to my family after all my parents' sacrifices."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00558,2023-11-07-T-012,558,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Most law firms also do not charge clients for the work done by trainees. Should this practice and trend persist with the extension, the current allowance renumerated may not be tenable for trainees and law firms over a long period of time."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00559,2023-11-07-T-012,559,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In comparison with other jurisdictions, the Law Society in the UK and Bar Standards Board recommend that trainees be paid approximately $2,800 to $3,600 in London."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00560,2023-11-07-T-012,560,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Furthermore, trainees presently do not have annual or sick leave accounted for during their practice training. Guidelines under the SILE also necessitate trainees to make up for any leave taken. This may not be sustainable for the health and well-being of trainees in the long run."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00561,2023-11-07-T-012,561,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Further, relying on a checklist and increasing the length of the training contract alone may not enrich the quality and rigour of the training experience. I would like to ask the Minister if there will be specific guidance and support given to law firms to ensure that the training period is a meaningful one, both for the employers and students."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00562,2023-11-07-T-012,562,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Finally, with a longer training period, firms will need to spend more money to hire trainees. Will there be support in place for smaller firms who are unable to cope with the increased costs?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00563,2023-11-07-T-012,563,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Secondly, on the introduction of a moratorium, this is not the first time this is being considered."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00564,2023-11-07-T-012,564,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"During interactions with young law students, they shared the immense pressure and competition to secure a training contract way ahead of graduation. This practice not only creates additional stress but also questions on whether it is fair to only account for two years of school results in the process."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00565,2023-11-07-T-012,565,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"However, I would like to clarify on the specific implementation details of the moratorium. Will firms be restricted to only accepting applications in particular months or will students be bound by their year of study for application? How will the Ministry enforce this amongst firms upon implementation and what are the avenues for students and firms to voice out any unfair practices that they may observe?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00566,2023-11-07-T-012,566,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Third, on the permission for trainees to complete up to three months of the practice training period at approved in-house legal departments of non-law practice entities. Given the broad range of opportunities there are, I can see how this would be an exciting option. For example, I was grateful for the chance previously to intern in ESPN, which married my interest in media and the law and helped me understand commercial needs."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00567,2023-11-07-T-012,567,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Although this expands the opportunities for trainees and also provides a potential pipeline of support for these companies, I would like to ask if there are any criteria imposed to ensure that trainees can gain an enriching experience comparable to their peers who are practising with law firms. Is there an estimate number of how many of such departments will be available to cater to potential demand? What will the allowance guidelines be for trainees who choose to pursue this path?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00568,2023-11-07-T-012,568,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Finally, the new section 22 empowers a judge on an application by the Attorney-General or the Council to order a lawyer (non-practitioner) to submit to a medical examination by a registered medical practitioner to determine whether the lawyer (non practitioner)'s fitness to practise provisionally has been impaired by a physical or mental condition. The Council will also be able to direct a lawyer (non-practitioner) to stop practising provisionally until he or she has submitted to a medical examination."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00569,2023-11-07-T-012,569,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As we understand, mental health is a continuum. The Government is also generally very cautious about compulsion to submit to medical examinations and the seeking of treatment unless an individual is at risk of harm to themselves or to the public."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00570,2023-11-07-T-012,570,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"For greater clarity, could the Ministry describe what sort of circumstances will warrant such an examination and how will the Council or Attorney-General determine when one is not suitable to practise? What are some conditions that will be considered an impairment and how can an individual who has recovered come back to practise?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00571,2023-11-07-T-012,571,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In conclusion, Sir, I am glad that the amendments facilitate a greater depth of exposure and experience and provide more career pathways for young lawyers. While the changes bring our system closer in alignment to other jurisdictions' standards and guidelines, greater clarity is necessary for aspiring and current law students. This is even more so as the recent changes to the Part B examinations have sparked distress among students. Previously, students studied seven compulsory subjects and two elective subjects. The latest revision sees students completing six modules across a wide breadth of 31 topics."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00572,2023-11-07-T-012,572,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I also look forward to the future guidance notes, which I understand will be developed in a consultative manner. This approach is much appreciated. Beyond legal practitioners, industry, Government and organisations, I hope that we involve, hear out and co-create with the very people these amendments seek to serve as well – law students themselves. To do so would be very much in line with the Government's call under Forward SG."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00573,2023-11-07-T-012,573,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In her speech, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary also described that many of these guidance notes and subsidiary legislation are in the works. My final question is whether there is an estimate when these will be ready. Notwithstanding the clarifications, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00574,2023-11-07-T-012,574,Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00575,2023-11-07-T-012,575,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill represents a significant step forward in our legal profession. The amendments are a positive development in addressing concerns about the availability of practice roles for our aspiring lawyers. However, I have several clarifications on the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00576,2023-11-07-T-012,576,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are practical concerns about how this Bill can truly enhance the quality of our legal professionals."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00577,2023-11-07-T-012,577,Yip Hon Weng,"Has the Ministry gathered feedback on the breadth and depth of training received by trainees? Additionally, is the supply of training places able to meet the demand? What trainees do and learn should advance their aspirations and chosen career paths. However, due to a shortage of training positions, a trainee may have little choice but to train at a firm or with a lawyer whose practice areas are vastly different. An extended training period may be disadvantageous to them in such cases. What types of support are available to such trainees if they wish to transition to other practice areas?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00578,2023-11-07-T-012,578,Yip Hon Weng,"Furthermore, if a trainee is unable to secure a training contract in one of the larger law firms, which may not have as many or as varied legal departments, will there still be an assurance of the same high-quality training? Will these trainees receive the breadth of experience required to enhance their knowledge and skillsets?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00579,2023-11-07-T-012,579,Yip Hon Weng,"Can we implement a system, perhaps through logbooks or checklists, to ensure that trainees in smaller law firms, or all trainees, gain the relevant breadth of experience? This could be a record-keeping document or online system that trainees use to track their activities, experiences and tasks during their practice training period. Equally important, how do we ensure the accuracy of these logbooks?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00580,2023-11-07-T-012,580,Yip Hon Weng,"Often, larger firms will select those who may have performed better in law school. How does the Law Society ensure that all trainees will continue to get equal exposure, regardless of their graduating results?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00581,2023-11-07-T-012,581,Yip Hon Weng,"Moreover, we should consider avenues for trainees to provide anonymous feedback to the Law Society regarding the quality of their training. This could be an invaluable resource in maintaining and improving the standard of training across the profession in the long term."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00582,2023-11-07-T-012,582,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, as we extend the practice training period, we must be vigilant in safeguarding against the potential exploitation of trainees and their wages. Some firms may take the work of trainees and charge clients as their own without giving due credit to the trainees."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00583,2023-11-07-T-012,583,Yip Hon Weng,"How will the Law Society safeguard against such exploitation? In such cases, when clients are billed at the full rate, how is liability managed in the event of any issues arising from this arrangement?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00584,2023-11-07-T-012,584,Yip Hon Weng,"Furthermore, will the Law Society consider mandating a minimum wage for trainees similar to what housemen are paid in the medical field? How will the Law Society protect those inexperienced trainees from law firms that might seek to take advantage of this extended practice period? As much as the extended practice period is important to an aspiring lawyer's development, they must also be treated fairly and remunerated equitably."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00585,2023-11-07-T-012,585,Yip Hon Weng,"Addressing the possible exploitation of young lawyers, particularly in larger firms where they are often burdened with arduous tasks and long hours, is critical. This scenario could also happen in smaller firms where there are fewer resources and manpower. This unhealthy work environment, characterised by excessive demands and little support, has led to a concerning attrition rate within the profession. Many dedicated individuals have been driven to leave due to these toxic conditions."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00586,2023-11-07-T-012,586,Yip Hon Weng,"What measures are being taken to rectify this issue and ensure a more sustainable and nurturing atmosphere for young legal professionals? I ask this because this House would recall that a lawyer of 20 years' standing was jailed, fined and disbarred for having abused his employees, among whom was a trainee."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00587,2023-11-07-T-012,587,Yip Hon Weng,"As with all other occupations, the relationship and balance of power between a supervising solicitor and a trainee tilt in the balance of the former. Have any measures been put in place to minimise future recurrences?"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00588,2023-11-07-T-012,588,Yip Hon Weng,"Third, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that this Bill was crafted during a time when there was an excess of lawyers. However, the situation may have evolved. Today, we are facing a shortage of legal professionals. Considering this, we must question whether the changes outlined in this Bill remain relevant in our current legal landscape."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00589,2023-11-07-T-012,589,Yip Hon Weng,"Undoubtedly, the quality of our legal professionals is paramount. Providing them with more time and exposure to different aspects of the legal landscape is a valuable step in their career development. It aids them in deciding their career goals and which specific areas to pursue."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00590,2023-11-07-T-012,590,Yip Hon Weng,"However, I am concerned that the longer practice period, while beneficial in many aspects, may exacerbate the existing shortage of legal professionals. This, in turn, places more pressure on lawyers, particularly the younger ones, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle as more may experience burnout and leave the profession. We must strike a balance between quality training and ensuring an adequate number of legal professionals to meet the growing demands of our society."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00591,2023-11-07-T-012,591,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my younger years, I almost did pursue an education in law. But due to circumstances then, I eventually ended up pursuing Mathematics. However, in a strange twist of fate, I am now a legislator as a Member of Parliament, working alongside lawyers, legal professionals and Parliamentary Clerks, scrutinising Bills and legislation. Hence, I am speaking on the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill because I believe this marks a substantial stride forward in advancing our legal field, particularly in addressing concerns over ample practice opportunities for aspiring lawyers. Nevertheless, there are critical clarifications needed."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00592,2023-11-07-T-012,592,Yip Hon Weng,"Firstly, we must address the practicality of ensuring top-notch training for all, especially in smaller law firms. Secondly, as we extend the practice training period, safeguards against potential exploitation of trainees must be in place. Lastly, we need to evaluate the Bill's relevance, considering the evolving legal landscape. While augmenting training time is beneficial, it is imperative to consider its potential impact on the shortage of legal professionals. Striking a balance between quality training and meeting the increasing demands of society is imperative to ensure a sustainable and thriving legal profession in Singapore. I support the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00593,2023-11-07-T-012,593,Speaker,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00594,2023-11-07-T-012,594,Rahayu Mahzam,"Sir, I thank Members who spoke in support of the Bill. Let me now address the questions that were raised."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00595,2023-11-07-T-012,595,Rahayu Mahzam,"First, Mr Yip Hon Weng has queried about the relevance of the Bill in our current legal landscape. While the Committee's recommendations were made in 2018, they were based on a longer-term, market-neutral perspective. Earlier, I referred to the recently released Forward SG Report, which stated that Singapore, as a society, wants to recognise and embrace multiple career pathways."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00596,2023-11-07-T-012,596,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Committee's report in 2018 recognised that the legal profession is a diverse and multi-faceted community with space for persons to contribute in many ways, and that it was important to cater to this. The Committee's recommendations also aimed to ensure overall standards for the professional training of lawyers were lifted. This continues to be relevant today."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00597,2023-11-07-T-012,597,Rahayu Mahzam,"The existing framework has served Singapore well, training generations of Singapore lawyers who have shaped Singapore's legal industry into the leading legal services hub it is today. But with the operating environment becoming more complex and competitive, it is even more pressing to adequately prepare our legal workforce for the multitude of roles that they may be expected to play in the future."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00598,2023-11-07-T-012,598,Rahayu Mahzam,"Our world is getting smaller yet increasingly polarised, and the lawyers of tomorrow will need to work collaboratively while embracing diversity, as they engage in more cross-border work. Technology has changed how lawyers work. Legal tech is increasingly used by law firms, in-house legal departments, the Courts and dispute resolution institutions. As consumers become more sophisticated, there is also growing demand for higher-value advice from lawyers."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00599,2023-11-07-T-012,599,Rahayu Mahzam,"As I mentioned earlier, this Bill is part of overall efforts to uplift the quality of law students and better prepare a future-ready legal workforce. Whether lawyers practise in a big or small Singapore law practice, or SLP, or in an international firm, their employer, clients and the broader industry will benefit from them having a better-grounded foundation. The first batch of law graduates under the new admission framework will commence their practice training period, or PTP, in January 2025. Upon completing their PTP, they will be better equipped to hit the ground running."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00600,2023-11-07-T-012,600,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, I will address questions from Mr Yip and Mr Patrick Tay on whether the recommendations will impact the supply of lawyers in Singapore, including whether there will be adequate practice training places and on retention of aspiring young lawyers in the industry."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00601,2023-11-07-T-012,601,Rahayu Mahzam,"Uncoupling admission from practice training will allow those who do not intend to practise to pursue other legal roles without investing additional time to complete the PTP. This will, in turn, reduce the competition for practice training positions. The attrition of lawyers is not a new phenomenon. Lawyers have many different options, aside from private practice. These include becoming in-house counsel, joining the Government or legal tech companies or entering academia."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00602,2023-11-07-T-012,602,Rahayu Mahzam,"We should embrace this. Legal talent is required to support all aspects of Singapore's economy and society. Through this Bill, we hope to better equip future law graduates to seize the myriad of opportunities available. At the same time, for those who choose to, the changes will better prepare and sustain them through the rigours of legal practice."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00603,2023-11-07-T-012,603,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the need for the new nomenclature of lawyer (NP) and their role in the legal landscape vis-à-vis other legal professionals. Both he and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked if, going forward, in-house legal counsel will need to, first, be admitted as lawyers (NP). The nomenclature of ""lawyer (non-practitioner)"" was determined after public consultation. It was not intended to replace the term ""legal counsel"", nor was it intended to introduce new qualification requirements for in-house counsel."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00604,2023-11-07-T-012,604,Rahayu Mahzam,"Rather, it is to distinguish lawyers (NP) from advocates and solicitors and other individuals, while still recognising them as crucial stakeholders in the legal industry. The nomenclature does not reflect any professional hierarchy; it differentiates who is able to practise in the public's and industry's minds. For existing in-house legal counsel who wish to be admitted as lawyers (NP), this would depend on whether they fall within the transitional arrangements in the Bill."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00605,2023-11-07-T-012,605,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, several Members, including Mr Louis Ng and Ms Nadia Samdin raised questions relating to the content and quality of the practice training during the lengthened Practice Training Period, or PTP. On this, I earlier mentioned that the SILE has published a detailed notice on its website outlining the new training requirements. Some of these requirements are already found in subsidiary legislation. MinLaw is working with the multiple stakeholders to amend the subsidiary legislation to include further operational details before the new framework comes into force by July 2024."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00606,2023-11-07-T-012,606,Rahayu Mahzam,"This includes the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011, or the Admission Rules, which already provide for the responsibilities of supervising solicitors and training SLPs under practice training contracts; how a practice trainee may serve his or her PTP, including in certain law offices in the Public Service, such as the Public Defender's Office; and flexibility for practice trainees to undertake their practice training with more than one SLP. This recognises that training SLPs may not have the expertise or resources to provide exposure to all the required practice areas."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00607,2023-11-07-T-012,607,Rahayu Mahzam,"The door is also open for trainees to provide feedback on their training. The Law Society has a dedicated email address and the Members' Assistance and Care Helpline through which it offers career counselling, mentorship, guidance and practical tips to members and law graduates who are seeking to practise law."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00608,2023-11-07-T-012,608,Rahayu Mahzam,"Several Members have raised the issue of honoraria and leave benefits for practice trainees during the lengthened PTP. Concerns include whether practice trainees are being treated as ""cheap"" labour; whether during the lengthened PTP, practice trainees from lower-income families or who have additional responsibilities, will face a disproportionate or undue financial burden; and whether practice trainees will ""burn out"" if they are not given leave benefits."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00609,2023-11-07-T-012,609,Rahayu Mahzam,"MinLaw understands these concerns. As part of the plan to implement the Committee's recommendations, we have been discussing measures to address them with the working groups. I will, first, cover the issue of honoraria."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00610,2023-11-07-T-012,610,Rahayu Mahzam,"Practice training is, at its core, an apprenticeship, where aspiring legal practitioners seek out mentors to guide them in the industry and provide opportunities for practical exposure. It is a symbiotic relationship, where both trainees and supervising solicitors come together to contribute to the continued development of Singapore's legal industry."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00611,2023-11-07-T-012,611,Rahayu Mahzam,"Through the mentorship and experience gained from being attached to a supervising solicitor, a practice trainee is better equipped to operate independently as a lawyer. On this basis, practice trainees today typically receive honoraria, but do not receive employee benefits, like paid leave or Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00612,2023-11-07-T-012,612,Rahayu Mahzam,"Training SLPs are often a practice trainee's first taste of legal practice and its accompanying realities and rigours. As ambassadors of the legal industry, it is important for training SLPs and supervising solicitors to support trainees, through the transition from school to legal practice with understanding, patience and fairness. This also sets the tone for a potentially longer-term employment relationship in the foreseeable future."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00613,2023-11-07-T-012,613,Rahayu Mahzam,"We encourage training SLPs to provide fair and reasonable honoraria that recognises trainees' contributions and allows them to meet their financial obligations. Under the new framework, training SLPs could also choose to grant larger honoraria to trainees with provisional PCs, recognising that they undertake a broader scope of responsibilities."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00614,2023-11-07-T-012,614,Rahayu Mahzam,"At the same time, we recognise that this needs to be balanced against the potential increased costs to law practices, particularly the smaller SLPs."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00615,2023-11-07-T-012,615,Rahayu Mahzam,"At present, there is no legislation prohibiting training SLPs from charging out for trainees' work. The Law Society has released guidance on such charging, which could help defray some costs of a longer PTP. Charging out for trainees' work would also recognise trainees' contributions and engender a greater sense of belonging within the profession."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00616,2023-11-07-T-012,616,Rahayu Mahzam,"That said, training SLPs will have to be mindful that charging clients for work done by practice trainees may change the nature of their relationship with the trainee to that of an employment relationship, with attendant CPF and employment tax obligations."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00617,2023-11-07-T-012,617,Rahayu Mahzam,"Some Members have suggested mandating a minimum honorarium quantum. While MinLaw has considered this, such a measure is prescriptive, introduces rigidity and would need to be constantly reviewed to account for prevailing conditions. The quantum also risks being set above what some small SLPs can afford and may also have the inadvertent effect of reducing the number of training places offered. MinLaw and the Law Society will continue to monitor the industry trends. Further guidance will be released as needed."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00618,2023-11-07-T-012,618,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, I will address the issue of leave benefits. MinLaw, SILE and the Law Society are already looking into granting practice trainees leave days and medical leave to support them through their PTP, as part of the overall implementation of the lengthened PTP. More details will be announced in due course."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00619,2023-11-07-T-012,619,Rahayu Mahzam,"Beyond pay and leave, we also recognise that there are other important factors in ensuring a trainee's mental well-being. The Law Society has led by example by establishing the Law Society Mentorship Scheme and the Young Lawyers Law Mentor Scheme. These schemes provide platforms for law graduates and young lawyers to discuss issues on mental well-being, career development and ethics in full confidentiality with more experienced mentors."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00620,2023-11-07-T-012,620,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, Mr Murali Pillai sought clarification on the length of PTP that legal and judicial service officers, or LSOs and JSOs, will be required to complete under the new framework. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum had also asked about completing PTP within the Public Service."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00621,2023-11-07-T-012,621,Rahayu Mahzam,"Today, LSOs and JSOs who wish to be admitted to the Bar can do so after completing their PTP, which is currently 36 months. However, unlike their peers in private practice, LSOs and JSOs are not required to be admitted to the Bar to perform their job functions in the Public Service. Their progression is also not prejudiced or affected by admission to the Bar."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00622,2023-11-07-T-012,622,Rahayu Mahzam,"Under the new framework, the PTP will be 12 months for all trainees across the industry. Trainees may continue to complete their PTP by working as an LSO or a JSO, or under the supervision of a Qualifying Relevant Legal Officer in the public sector. A review was undertaken of the training programme for LSOs and JSOs. The Committee's report noted that there is little substantive difference in the content or quality of training provided in the public and private sectors. In both cases, the training covers legal skills, professional responsibilities and ethics, etiquette and conduct. This was a key rationale for the change in the PTP period for LSOs and JSOs."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00623,2023-11-07-T-012,623,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, several Members raised questions and concerns about implementing the CPTL's recommendation to raise the standards and stringency of the Part B Bar exams. This topic falls outside the scope of the Bill. However, I will comment briefly."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00624,2023-11-07-T-012,624,Rahayu Mahzam,"This was one of the Committee's key structural recommendations. It was intended to ensure that the quality of the Singapore Bar remains consistently high and to better equip our law graduates. SILE has revamped the Part B Course to include topics that are gaining importance, focus on core principles and mirror the realities of practice."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00625,2023-11-07-T-012,625,Rahayu Mahzam,"The new Part B Course was introduced in the 2023 session. SILE has received constructive feedback from the industry and current candidates. Support has been offered to the current candidates, including more on-demand video lectures and contact hours, live Q&A segments during Contact Sessions and recordings for candidates to review. MinLaw will continue working with SILE to engage current candidates to understand where the gaps are and what further refinements can be introduced."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00626,2023-11-07-T-012,626,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, on allowing up to three months of PTP to be completed at the in-house legal departments of approved non-law practice entities. Members had asked for more details about the application process, the qualifying criteria for these entities and had proposed entities for consideration."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00627,2023-11-07-T-012,627,Rahayu Mahzam,"This is optional for practice trainees. Further details, including the formal application process and finalised criteria for qualifying entities, will be announced in due course."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00628,2023-11-07-T-012,628,Rahayu Mahzam,"To provide insight, MinLaw had, in 2019, publicly consulted on the qualifying criteria proposed by the working group. They included suggestions that the entity should  have a minimum of three lawyers doing legal work; have at least one Singapore-qualified lawyer with at least five years of legal experience, either in-house or in active practice, within the last seven years, who will act as supervising counsel to the trainee; and handle a sufficient amount of Singapore law-related work for the trainee to receive meaningful training in Singapore law."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00629,2023-11-07-T-012,629,Rahayu Mahzam,The majority of the respondents supported the criteria proposed in the public consultation. The working group will refer to these proposed criteria and Members' suggestions when preparing the subsidiary legislation on the qualifying criteria. Non-law practice entities that wish to offer training opportunities may write to SILE and MinLaw to register their interest in being considered.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00630,2023-11-07-T-012,630,Rahayu Mahzam,"Some Members asked about how the new framework for provisional PCs will be operationalised, such as the professional indemnity insurance requirements, what happens if a provisional PC is suspended or revoked and how a lawyer (NP)'s fitness to hold a provisional PC will be determined."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00631,2023-11-07-T-012,631,Rahayu Mahzam,"I had mentioned in my opening speech that the framework for provisional PCs in the Bill is substantively similar to that concerning PCs for advocates and solicitors. It is, therefore, open to the relevant stakeholders to take guidance from existing practices and case law concerning PCs, such as a solicitor's fitness to hold a PC when applying the new provisional PC framework. Further operational details are being worked on by the multi-stakeholder working groups and will be released in due course."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00632,2023-11-07-T-012,632,Rahayu Mahzam,"Next, several Members have sought clarification on how the moratorium period will be implemented and operationalised, including how breaches will be detected and possible consequences. The multi-stakeholder working group has been discussing these details."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00633,2023-11-07-T-012,633,Rahayu Mahzam,"As mentioned earlier, this Bill amends the Act to provide flexibility for implementing such details in the future. Before introducing the measures to strictly enforce the moratorium period, the relevant agencies will engage law students and law practices to socialise the change."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00634,2023-11-07-T-012,634,Rahayu Mahzam,"Several Members have also raised issues not directly covered in the Bill. These touch on implementation and operational details of the Committee's recommendations. For example, the relationship between trainees and supervising solicitors, suggestions for Continuing Professional Development activities and the extension of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy to support trainees during the lengthened PTP. I thank Members for their comments and suggestions. MinLaw will work with the relevant stakeholders and working groups to review the feedback received."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00635,2023-11-07-T-012,635,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, I believe that I have addressed all the questions posed by Members on the Bill. Sir, with that, I beg to move."
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00636,2023-11-07-T-012,636,Speaker,Do Members have any clarifications for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu? No.
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00637,2023-11-07-T-012,637,Speaker,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00638,2023-11-07-T-012,638,Speaker,[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00639,2023-11-07-T-012,639,Speaker,[(proc text) The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Ms Rahayu Mahzam.] (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-012-S-00640,2023-11-07-T-012,640,Speaker,[(proc text) Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00641,2023-11-07-T-013,641,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00642,2023-11-07-T-013,642,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move*, ""That this House calls on the Government to review its policies so as to lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families""."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00643,2023-11-07-T-013,643,Pritam Singh,[(proc text) *The Motion also stood in the name of Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00644,2023-11-07-T-013,644,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, on the occasion of the New Year in 2022, the Workers' Party (WP) identified cost of living as a major pressure point for low- to middle-income families, which strikes most acutely the families with both young children and aged parents to care for."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00645,2023-11-07-T-013,645,Pritam Singh,"In the same message, the WP committed to tracking how the Government upgrades its legacy schemes for, and I quote  ""the circumstances of today and tomorrow, not yesterday"". The reality of the pressures faced by low- and middle-income Singaporeans was repeated in the WP May Day message that same year. On May Day this year, the WP warned that Singaporeans were living through one of the most rapid cost-of-living rises in history, eroding the purchasing power of their wages."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00646,2023-11-07-T-013,646,Pritam Singh,"And, finally, in our National Day message this year, celebrations which also saw a remake of Dick Lee's 1988 hit, ""Home"", the WP noted that just as the remake of ""Home"" comes at a time when Singapore and the world are at a different juncture from a quarter century ago, our national policies also need to be re-examined to make them relevant to today's Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00647,2023-11-07-T-013,647,Pritam Singh,"On cost of living, the WP acknowledges the one-time reliefs extended to eligible households. Most recently, on the back of the announcement by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) in late September of an increase in water prices."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00648,2023-11-07-T-013,648,Pritam Singh,"For the purposes of this Motion, the WP will look into possibilities of further reducing cost-of-living pressures by way of policy change. This House must leave no stone unturned because, for some Singaporeans, this has become a cost-of-living crisis."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00649,2023-11-07-T-013,649,Pritam Singh,"My speech is in three parts. First, I will cover the situation facing Singaporeans on the ground, particularly for workers, seniors and their families. Second, I will cover some policy areas where the Government can explore the prospect of lowering costs for Singaporeans in different ways. Finally, I will outline specific areas which will be expanded upon by the WP Members of Parliament (MPs), where policies can be changed, enhanced, revisited or even overhauled, so as to lower cost-of-living pressures for Singaporeans and their families."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00650,2023-11-07-T-013,650,Pritam Singh,"First, the cost-of-living reality facing Singaporeans. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s inflation outlook tells us that inflation has slowed across a broad range of goods and services and core inflation is projected to come down to between 2.5% and 3% by December, lower than its 5.5% peak in January."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00651,2023-11-07-T-013,651,Pritam Singh,"However, from our ground outreach and from feedback received by the WP, cost of living worries for Singaporeans are clearly moving in the opposite direction. This is understandable, as there is a chasm between, on the one hand, headlines that say that inflation is stabilising, while on the other hand, price rises continue to hit Singaporeans hard."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00652,2023-11-07-T-013,652,Pritam Singh,The Parliamentary reply by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) this morning of a 4.5% fall in real median income in the first half of 2023 is consistent with this emotion.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00653,2023-11-07-T-013,653,Pritam Singh,"The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation, only covers household consumption expenditures and does not include non-consumption expenditures, such as loan repayments, the purchase of property, including Housing and Development (HDB) flats, monthly mortgage payments and credit card debt payments."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00654,2023-11-07-T-013,654,Pritam Singh,"Interest rates are often accompanied by price increases and loan interest rates remain high. What was cash-in-hand not too long ago has, now and in the future, to be used for interest payments. This reality reinforces the view that prices are galloping away and that incomes are struggling to catch up."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00655,2023-11-07-T-013,655,Pritam Singh,"It is important to also consider the compounding effect of price increases with costs passed down from enterprises to consumers. The breadth and depth of the rise in prices also vary considerably, since consumption patterns differ from each household. For example, a household with young children will be sensitive to rising tuition and enrichment class costs, in addition to other expenses that accompany raising a child."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00656,2023-11-07-T-013,656,Pritam Singh,"Singaporeans who need a vehicle for their work are understandably more sensitive to Certificate of Entitlement (COE), diesel and petrol prices."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00657,2023-11-07-T-013,657,Pritam Singh,"On the other hand, food prices account for a large proportion of income at the lowest strata of society. And so, when a plate of chicken rice or noodles goes up by $2 or $3 and coffee prices shoot up far more than increases in water prices, for example, the pinch for low- and even middle-income Singaporeans is real and painful."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00658,2023-11-07-T-013,658,Pritam Singh,"When income growth cannot match this increase in prices, it is perfectly understandable why Singaporeans feel nervous and anxious. In some cases, this may even lead to the deterioration of their mental health."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00659,2023-11-07-T-013,659,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, a Forum Page letter in The Straits Times on 27 September 2023 was titled  ""Cost of Living  More help needed for lower-income families affected by rising prices"". The letter put into words the worries of many Singaporeans that the rising price of goods and services that began right after the COVID-19 crisis would trap Singapore in a vicious circle of unending price increases."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00660,2023-11-07-T-013,660,Pritam Singh,"For example, and I quote  ""The transport fare and Goods and Services Tax (GST) increases are likely to trickle down into higher operating costs for all businesses, including hawkers and coffee shop operators, who will then be compelled to pass on the incremental cost by raising their prices to remain profitable and to survive"". It goes on  ""Life can become challenging and stressful in an inflationary environment with reduced real income and purchasing power. Some low-income families are prone to becoming dysfunctional, resulting in domestic conflict and disharmony."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00661,2023-11-07-T-013,661,Pritam Singh,"The Government rolled out a S$1.1 billion support package in late September, around the same time the PUB announced a hike in water prices. One oft-quoted economist expressed surprise at the timing of the announcement of the support package and suggested that the Government was confident of funding it from better-than-expected revenue collected. This would explain why it was able to announce the measure halfway through the fiscal year. He said, ""From a political standpoint, it shows that the overall fiscal position of the Government is strong enough to be able to give some back before the Budget."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00662,2023-11-07-T-013,662,Pritam Singh,"Sir, this off-Budget package and the Government's current fiscal position calls into question the necessity of a GST hike next year. The People's Action Party (PAP)'s argument is that a GST hike is necessary and that this is a political decision it has taken for reasons it has explained."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00663,2023-11-07-T-013,663,Pritam Singh,"My co-sponsor for this Motion, Sengkang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) MP, Louis Chua will speak more about this. But given the inflationary environment and the substantial effects on the ground, the WP calls for a review of this decision, in light of the cost-of-living crisis."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00664,2023-11-07-T-013,664,Pritam Singh,"Like the many other increases announced over the last month, there is a real concern that a 1% rise in GST will have yet another knock-on consequence on prices on the ground from January next year."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00665,2023-11-07-T-013,665,Pritam Singh,"The contributions of the WP in this debate will move beyond one-time fiscal handouts and explore possible structural changes to existing policies to reduce cost-of-living expenses for ordinary Singaporeans who live in an elevated, inflationary and interest-rate environment and they will continue living in such a scenario for some time to come."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00666,2023-11-07-T-013,666,Pritam Singh,"Individually, the WP MPs' suggestions will understandably be specific to a particular policy area. But taken as a whole, they point to the possibility of instituting significant structural adjustments to policies that account for the reality of today and tomorrow's cost of living environment, especially for low-income groups and those like the sandwich middle class."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00667,2023-11-07-T-013,667,Pritam Singh,I will now come on to the next part of my speech.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00668,2023-11-07-T-013,668,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I believe we can better align domestic water tariff tiers to actual consumption by households with the view to reducing water bills for households that conserve water."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00669,2023-11-07-T-013,669,Pritam Singh,"The last time domestic water tariff tiers were restructured, it took place over four years from 1997 to 2000. At the end of that exercise, water prices went up more than 120%. A major impetus for that price hike was the argument that Singapore would be short of water after the expiry of the 2011 Water Agreement with Malaysia."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00670,2023-11-07-T-013,670,Pritam Singh,A parallel objective of the exercise was to get Singaporeans to treat water as a precious and strategic resource and to make water conservation a way of life. Water borne fees were also raised to recover the cost of wastewater treatment.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00671,2023-11-07-T-013,671,Pritam Singh,"Prior to the year 2000, the domestic water tariff had three tiers to correspond to different consumption levels. The three tiers of water prices for domestic use were as follows  households that used zero to 20 cubic metres of water a month followed by those that used 20 to 40 cubic metres and finally, those that used more than 40 cubic metres a month."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00672,2023-11-07-T-013,672,Pritam Singh,"After the water pricing restructuring exercise from the year 2000, the Government did away with three tiers for domestic users and proceeded with only two tiers. A household today is charged differently only if it consumes more than 40 cubic metres a month. If you consume below 20 cubic metres of water a month, you will be charged at the rate between zero to 40 cubic metres since there is no specific tier between zero and 20 cubic metres of water anymore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00673,2023-11-07-T-013,673,Pritam Singh,"Arising from the changes in the year 2000, the Government decided that it was not going to continue charging households at the lowest rate tier because these households were not subject to a significant water conservation tax."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00674,2023-11-07-T-013,674,Pritam Singh,"Based on publicly available information I have perused, there was no argument canvassed for specifically moving away from a three tier to a two-tiered water pricing regime for households beyond general statements of intent, and it was not explained why an increase in the water conservation tax could not be imposed for those consuming between zero and 20 cubic metres of water per month to cohere with treating each drop of water as a precious resource. However, arising from the low amount of water conservation tax paid, it was advanced that these households in the lowest domestic tier had little to no incentive to save water."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00675,2023-11-07-T-013,675,Pritam Singh,"Prior to the changes of the water pricing structure in 2000, about 56% of Singaporean households used less than 20 cubic metres of water and paid no water conservation tax. Thirty-four percent if households paid for water at the next tier which was between 20 and 40 cubic metres of water with a low water conservation tax. The 10% of households that consumed more than 40 cubic metres of water paid a smaller water conservation tax at 15%, than non-domestic consumers at 20%."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00676,2023-11-07-T-013,676,Pritam Singh,The latter was deemed by the Government to be an unsatisfactory state of affairs as large non-domestic water users or businesses were assessed to often recycle a large proportion of the water they used and were not necessarily more wasteful than large domestic users.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00677,2023-11-07-T-013,677,Pritam Singh,The Government argued that the existing pricing structure would jack up business costs and affect Singapore's business costs and competitiveness and will also fail to have a significant effect on smaller households paying lower domestic rates.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00678,2023-11-07-T-013,678,Pritam Singh,"Compared to 56% of households in the past who consumed between zero and 20 cubic metres of water, today 96% of households are consuming between zero and 40 cubic metres of water, with HDB dwellers consuming 16.2 cubic metres of water per month in 2020. Evidently, these HDB households in particular are paying for water at the lower of the two tiers, But this supposedly lowered tier captures users within a very wide pricing band of zero to 40 cubic metres."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00679,2023-11-07-T-013,679,Pritam Singh,"I call on the Government to look into the prospect of restructuring water pricing tiers so as to more accurately reflect water usage, with a view to incentivise water conservation and lower costs for households."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00680,2023-11-07-T-013,680,Pritam Singh,"The current two-tier compared to the legacy three-tier structure for domestic users does not fairly reflect water consumption patterns. In fact, a case can be made that it puts a heavier water conservation tax burden for the majority of users whose overall consumption patterns are already located in the lower half of the current zero to 40 cubic metres end."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00681,2023-11-07-T-013,681,Pritam Singh,"To this end, Mr Speaker, I ask the Government to look into the introduction of a fairer and more acutely tiered tariff structure reflecting actual consumption of water from zero to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40 and 40 and above cubic metres, with a view to encouraging greater efforts at water conservation. This should be coupled with a graduated water conservation tax regime starting at 30% for those consuming between zero and 10 cubic metres of water and hitting 60% for households that consume between 30 and 40 cubic metres of water per month so that households that consume more water cross subsidised those that consume less."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00682,2023-11-07-T-013,682,Pritam Singh,"A graduated water conservation tax across the various tiers would incentivise water conservation and continue to serve the policy purpose of ensuring that water is continually treated as a scarce commodity. With this more acutely tiered water pricing regime, the quantum of fiscal support provided through GST Vouchers – U-Save can be right-sized proportionately."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00683,2023-11-07-T-013,683,Pritam Singh,"Under such a fairer tariff structure, the 96% of households consuming less than 40 cubic metres of water today would be charged a water conservation tax that more progressively reflects how much they actually consumed and these households ought to see a reduction in water charges."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00684,2023-11-07-T-013,684,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, in contrast to households, non-domestic users are charged a flat rate with a lower water conservation tax than the current uppermost tier for households or domestic users."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00685,2023-11-07-T-013,685,Pritam Singh,The Government should look into the state of affairs from a fresh perspective and assess if tiers can be introduced for businesses for a fairer and better deployment of the water conservation tax with a view to better support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that potentially can be incentivised to use less water where possible.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00686,2023-11-07-T-013,686,Pritam Singh,"As public information for the use of water by different types of businesses is not readily available, this would have to be explored further to determine how to make the water conservation tax promote behavioural change for different types of non-domestic users,"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00687,2023-11-07-T-013,687,Pritam Singh,Introducing tiers for non-domestic consumers would equalise the expectation of water conservation as a shared objective of households and businesses.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00688,2023-11-07-T-013,688,Pritam Singh,"To this end, it would be useful to recap where we were and where we are in our water journey."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00689,2023-11-07-T-013,689,Pritam Singh,"Under our Green Plan 2030, Singapore's blueprint for a more sustainable future that sets out our green targets, Singapore aims to reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per person per day. In 2021, it was at 158 litres. As recently as 2017, PUB sought to reduce consumption to 140 litres per person per day by 2030, but the reality of climate change has necessitated the drawing up of new targets."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00690,2023-11-07-T-013,690,Pritam Singh,I would advance that the lowering the water conservation tax for households that conserve more water under a more finely determined tariff structure would promote behavioural change that would also allow us to meet green targets while simultaneously lowering cost for end consumers.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00691,2023-11-07-T-013,691,Pritam Singh,"Moving on to prices more generally, Mr Speaker, the cost of living crisis has not gone unnoticed by Singapore businesses. Some companies have announced inflation support payments as cost of living subsidies to junior staff. But there are companies that have done more than give one-time support."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00692,2023-11-07-T-013,692,Pritam Singh,"For example, Prudential Singapore was reported by The Business Times to have improved medical and outpatient benefits such as dental consultations and outpatient specialist treatments, including alternative treatments. These enhancements to existing schemes were in addition to wage adjustments to match inflation and market competitiveness to support employee groups most affected by rising costs. DBS Bank, for example, has enhanced the POSB HDB home loan package with an all-in interest rate of 2.6% per annum for borrowers with a monthly income of $2,500 and below."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00693,2023-11-07-T-013,693,Pritam Singh,"Sir, if businesses can adjust their policies beyond one-time support, the Government certainly can do more too."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00694,2023-11-07-T-013,694,Pritam Singh,"In this light, as advanced by the WP, I reiterate the call in this Motion for the Government to review all its existing schemes, make them fit for purpose in this heightened inflationary environment so as to better support Singaporeans against the onslaught of prices, which is destined to continue unabated, particularly with the upcoming hike to the GST."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00695,2023-11-07-T-013,695,Pritam Singh,"Take for example the Workforce Income Supplement (WIS) which was extended to workers aged between 30 and 34 last year, including a $200 increase for workers earning a gross income of 2,500 and below."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00696,2023-11-07-T-013,696,Pritam Singh,"Sir, WIS is currently split into 40% cash in 60% CPF contribution. If one is self-employed, the cash component of WIS is only 10% with a 90% MediSave contribution."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00697,2023-11-07-T-013,697,Pritam Singh,"Sir, it would be useful to consider a shift in the weightage of the WIS for our low-income workers in this period of heightened inflation in favour of a greater cash payout. As wages traditional do not move was fast and as significant in quantum for Singaporeans at the lower decils, additional cash in hand will provide much needed relief for our workers, sensitive to the needs of the hour. A few hundred dollars for seniors who continued to work and for whom WIS payments are pegged at the highest tiers can make a world of difference to their lives."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00698,2023-11-07-T-013,698,Pritam Singh,"Finally, before the advent of COVID-19, I had asked the then Senior Minister of State of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to look into whether it was possible to raise the amount of MediSave monies older Singaporeans were able to utilise for outpatient treatments and possibly to peg the withdrawal limit to how much seniors have in their MediSave accounts."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00699,2023-11-07-T-013,699,Pritam Singh,"Arising from a Parliamentary Question (PQ) filed by Ms Hazel Poa in late 2020, we know that individuals aged 85 and above have on average about $6,300 left in their MediSave accounts upon their demise."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00700,2023-11-07-T-013,700,Pritam Singh,"A more acute set of data was presented by MOH arising from a PQ by Member Patrick Tay. This data revealed that for Singaporeans who passed away aged 85 or older, between 2017 and 2021, about 20% had $1,000 or less left in their MediSave accounts and 50% had between $1,000 and $10,000 left. Of greater interest is the fact that 10% had between $10,000 and $20,000 left and another 10% had between $20,000 and $30,000, and the last 10% had more than $30,000 left in their MediSave accounts."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00701,2023-11-07-T-013,701,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, these numbers indicate there is a scope to allow some seniors with healthy MediSave balances to deploy them for their own use beyond what is allowed today. In fact, the aforesaid approach is already taken for the use of MediSave monies with regard to long-term care. The challenge would be to find the optimum level that also takes into account the prospect of medical inflation and ensures that there is little to no premature emptying of MediSave accounts. This may be difficult for seniors who, for example, are between 60 and 70 years of age and have less than $10,000 in their MediSave accounts."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00702,2023-11-07-T-013,702,Pritam Singh,"However, even the limited amount of MOH data I have quoted shows that further loosening of MediSave rules is conceivable. This would help some senior Singaporeans who have to cope with cost of living concerns that can be aggravated especially if they are no longer working."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00703,2023-11-07-T-013,703,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I move to conclude  the WP MPs will expand on other changes that can be implemented to lower the cost of living for Singaporeans. Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua, He Ting Ru and Jamus Lim will focus on housing, healthcare and transport. Aljunied GRC MP Gerald Giam will cover public transport, while Sylvia Lim will speak about electricity prices. MP for Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) Dennis Tan will review certain aspects of means testing in our public healthcare system and help for families with adults with special needs or disabilities. For his part, Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap will make a case to introduce social protection steps and in the name of a refreshed social compact to adopt a more systematic approach towards tracking the effectiveness of our social assistance programmes. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00704,2023-11-07-T-013,704,Pritam Singh,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00705,2023-11-07-T-013,705,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00706,2023-11-07-T-013,706,Liang Eng Hwa,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the rising cost of living across the globe has become a global concern. We have seen sharp price increases in Europe, the United States (US) and other continents; triggered of by a series of supply shocks that leads to sharp increases in energy, food and commodity prices as well as the demand arising from post-COVID recovery."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00707,2023-11-07-T-013,707,Liang Eng Hwa,"In the largest economy in the world, the US, its Federal Reserves or the Fed has raised its interest rates 11 times in just about one and a half years to tame the stubbornly high inflation, lifting rates from about 1% to near 5.5% today. So have the other central banks near and far, raising rates to manage and dampen demand."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00708,2023-11-07-T-013,708,Liang Eng Hwa,"Singapore is not spared from this global inflationary crisis. While inflation has come down from its peak, households are still having to cope with the impact of the various price increases. In addition, we are also faced with domestic cost pressures and, in particular, we are in this necessary transition to uplift the wages of fellow Singaporeans, especially the low-wage workers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00709,2023-11-07-T-013,709,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, cost of the living is a topic that I have filed among the most PQs in recent years, so had many of the Members of Parliament from both sides of the aisles. We can feel firsthand the impact of the cost of living increases in our neighbourhood centres, at our workplaces and in our daily living experiences. Our low- to middle-income Singaporeans are particularly affected."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00710,2023-11-07-T-013,710,Liang Eng Hwa,"So, what is our counter to these series of rising costs?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00711,2023-11-07-T-013,711,Liang Eng Hwa,"In the case of Singapore, fortunately, we do have a suite of policy tools that help us mitigate the impact of rising cost pressures."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00712,2023-11-07-T-013,712,Liang Eng Hwa,"First, our strong Singapore dollar. Our strong Singapore dollar has been an effective broad-based tool to manage imported inflation as almost everything that we consume are imported. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has tightened our monetary policy five times since October 2021, in essence, strengthening the Singapore dollar against the currencies of our major trading partners. Without the strong Singapore dollar, our inflation and hence, cost of living situation would have been even more severe."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00713,2023-11-07-T-013,713,Liang Eng Hwa,"Here, I just want caution that a strong Singapore dollar is not always a given. It is not a drop from sky for us. We cannot just demand a strong Singapore dollar or decree as such. It depends on the markets, which, in turn, depends on whether we have the strong economic fundamentals to deserve this value of the Singapore dollar. If our fundamentals are weakened, you can rest assured the markets will find a new value for the Singapore dollar almost instantly."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00714,2023-11-07-T-013,714,Liang Eng Hwa,"Fundamentals such as economic dynamism, competent economic management, financial reserves, political stability, social harmony and importantly, prudent fiscal management. These factors have a bearing on our international ratings and the confidence in the Singapore dollar and hence, preserve our purchasing power. So, let us jealously safeguard this very important asset that we have and not undermine it."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00715,2023-11-07-T-013,715,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, competitive business and enterprise ecosystem. Having a competitive business landscape at both the macro and retail level are important to keep prices in check and to prevent profiteering. Essentially, we want consumers to have choices and have the option to compare prices, whether it is to choose a new mobile phone plan or to buy groceries from among the supermarkets that we have."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00716,2023-11-07-T-013,716,Liang Eng Hwa,"In Chinese, we call this ""货比三家"" or ""货比或多家"", or to be able to compare prices across three or more shops."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00717,2023-11-07-T-013,717,Liang Eng Hwa,"Years ago, I was among the strong proponents for the Government to resume building hawker centres and was glad that the Government eventually reversed its policy in 2011 to start building hawker centres again. Hawker centres, besides keeping our hawker culture going, help to create a competitive environment in the eating house space, directly competing with coffee shops and other eateries. More importantly, it offers consumers choices and more value-for-money options."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00718,2023-11-07-T-013,718,Liang Eng Hwa,"We need to keep the business ecosystem competitive, including having diverse sources of supply, just in case we are being outpriced by some of these traditional sources of supply."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00719,2023-11-07-T-013,719,Liang Eng Hwa,"Thirdly, jobs and income growth. Having job and income growth helps an individual and their family cope with the cost of living. Growing the economy to create good jobs and better pay is critical, which is why we continually invest in skills upgrade to improve employability."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00720,2023-11-07-T-013,720,Liang Eng Hwa,We need a business-friendly ecosystem and to continually attract investments so as to keep the economy strong and vibrant to create good jobs. Having a strong economy also helps generate the tax revenues needed to pay for our growing expenditures. This is another important component – jobs and income growth.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00721,2023-11-07-T-013,721,Liang Eng Hwa,"Fourthly, direct Government assistance. Beyond the multi-pronged macro strategies, direct Government assistance is the key source of support to help Singaporeans cope with rising costs, both the subsidies and support packages."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00722,2023-11-07-T-013,722,Liang Eng Hwa,"The Government do subsidise substantially in a range of areas – healthcare, housing, education, transport, childcare and a range of social programmes, amongst others. To help Singaporeans better cope with the current cost of living concerns and the new GST rates, the Government has provided direct support assistance through the Budget and off-Budget measures since last year."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00723,2023-11-07-T-013,723,Liang Eng Hwa,"We have the permanent GST Voucher scheme and the Assurance Package. Both have been enhanced. In September this year, the Government announced an additional $1.1 billion Cost of Living Package to provide relief to lower- to middle-income families. This includes a further $800 million enhancements to the Assurance Package as well as an additional subsidy of about $300 million to moderate the fare increase of public transport."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00724,2023-11-07-T-013,724,Liang Eng Hwa,"Because of the various enhancements to these packages and the payouts that are spread throughout the year, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) now publishes the calendar view of the monthly disbursements so that it is easier for Singaporeans to anticipate the payouts each month."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00725,2023-11-07-T-013,725,Liang Eng Hwa,"I must say that when I distributed this handout to my residents during a Kopi Talk, all of them welcomed this and kept this so that they can track whether they are receiving all these payouts. It is something that is helping our residents directly."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00726,2023-11-07-T-013,726,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, I believe in today's debate on the Motion on cost of living, we are not looking at either extreme, that is, on one extreme, we pass on the full impact of all the cost increases to consumers and, on the other extreme, the Government fully shields people from all impacts of cost increases."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00727,2023-11-07-T-013,727,Liang Eng Hwa,"I believe no government in the world would adopt either extreme approach. For that matter, no Town Councils will do that as well."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00728,2023-11-07-T-013,728,Liang Eng Hwa,"Rather, we are here debating what that balance is. How could we continue to pursue polices which, together, lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families, but without undermining our fiscal sustainability and being responsible to future generations?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00729,2023-11-07-T-013,729,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, I want to add a couple of points before I sum up."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00730,2023-11-07-T-013,730,Liang Eng Hwa,"Firstly, this global inflationary situation, while we hope that it will go away soon, may actually last longer that we thought. The unending war in Ukraine, potentially the escalation of conflicts in Middle East, superpowers' geopolitical tensions, the rivalry that is being played in the global supply chain, the adverse weather that we now see more often – all these could fuel further shocks to the energy, food and commodity markets. So, we must be prepared that the high-cost situation around the world could worsen or continue for a prolonged period of time."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00731,2023-11-07-T-013,731,Liang Eng Hwa,"In other words, we must be prepared to sustain the long haul."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00732,2023-11-07-T-013,732,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, these additional costs whether it is from having to pay for higher energy costs, higher food costs, higher imported material costs and so on, are real costs or outflows to us as a country entity. For example, in the production of clean water, the higher energy costs to treat and recycle water is an outlay that will flow out of the country to the energy producing country."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00733,2023-11-07-T-013,733,Liang Eng Hwa,"My point here is that we need to be able to always have the means to pay for these costs, which is rising in our current situation. Just because we freeze prices or put a cap to price increases, the outflow required to pay for these external costs does not just disappear magically."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00734,2023-11-07-T-013,734,Liang Eng Hwa,The only way to do it on a sustainable basis is to be able to generate inflows to be able to pay for these additional costs.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00735,2023-11-07-T-013,735,Liang Eng Hwa,"Hence, the need to grow our economy to build capabilities to generate revenue, the need for a foreign exchange to create jobs, better wages so that individual and households can have the means to cope with the cost of living. This is more so for a small island state like Singapore with no natural resources. We must be able to get our inflows so that we can pay for our outflows."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00736,2023-11-07-T-013,736,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, we must get our fundamentals right. This is the only sustainable and sound way forward as we continue to tackle expected and unexpected challenges and crises ahead in this volatile and uncertain world."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00737,2023-11-07-T-013,737,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, in this context and with your consent, I would like to propose amendments to the Motion."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00738,2023-11-07-T-013,738,Speaker,Can I have a copy of your amendment? [

2023-11-07-T-013-S-00741,2023-11-07-T-013,741,Liang Eng Hwa,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following amendments"

2023-11-07-T-013-S-00745,2023-11-07-T-013,745,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, I beg to move."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00746,2023-11-07-T-013,746,Speaker,There are three amendments proposed by Mr Liang Eng Hwa to the Motion. These are

2023-11-07-T-013-S-00750,2023-11-07-T-013,750,Speaker,It may be convenient that the debate on the original Motion and on any other amendments moved by Members be proceeded with simultaneously as a debate on a single question. Do I have the hon Members' agreement to this?

2023-11-07-T-013-S-00757,2023-11-07-T-013,757,Sylvia Lim,"Mr Speaker, electricity is a basic necessity of modern living. However, as a small nation with few natural resources, we are forced to rely on others for our energy needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00758,2023-11-07-T-013,758,Sylvia Lim,"According to the Energy Market Authority (EMA), 95% of our electricity is generated using imported natural gas. This leaves us vulnerable to global events, including rising gas prices, tensions in the Middle East and supply disruptions, which all may cause energy prices to spike unexpectedly. It is therefore in our national interest to conserve energy and diversify our energy sources."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00759,2023-11-07-T-013,759,Sylvia Lim,"While the electricity tariff has experienced some ups and downs in recent quarters, the SP Group recently announced that electricity tariffs for the fourth quarter of this year would go up by 3.7% per kilowatt-hour (kWh), due to higher fuel costs. This, in turn, will result in higher electricity bills for households and small businesses, adding to the high costs of living that Singaporeans are struggling to grapple with."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00760,2023-11-07-T-013,760,Sylvia Lim,"As far as electricity usage is concerned, our priorities should be encouraging energy conservation and managing costs for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00761,2023-11-07-T-013,761,Sylvia Lim,"To this end, I have noted recent Government announcements, such as the setting up of Gasco to centralise gas procurement by next year, which has the potential to bring down the cost of gas for power generation. There is also a pilot initiative next year to offer rebates to consumers who reduce usage during peak hours."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00762,2023-11-07-T-013,762,Sylvia Lim,"However, in my opinion, more can be done to one, encourage conservation of electricity; and two, lower costs for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00763,2023-11-07-T-013,763,Sylvia Lim,"First, on the pricing of household electricity. About 15 years ago, in 2008, this House debated public concerns about high electricity prices. At that time, I raised the possibility of adopting a tiered pricing model, which would enable households who consumed moderate amounts of electricity to pay for usage at a lower rate, if their consumption did not exceed a certain threshold. Households who consumed electricity in excess of the threshold would pay for the excess at a higher rate."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00764,2023-11-07-T-013,764,Sylvia Lim,"In rejecting my suggestion in 2008 and again in 2010, then Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) Senior Minister of State S Iswaran, argued that the Government intended to facilitate competition in household electricity pricing through opening the retail electricity market."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00765,2023-11-07-T-013,765,Sylvia Lim,"The Government touted more flexible choices and ""competitive pricing"" with the new open electricity market for consumers. Please allow me to quote what then Senior Minister of State Iswaran said  ""…in the long term, EMA is working towards opening up the household electricity market for competition so that consumers will be able to purchase electricity direct from different suppliers through a range of retail packages that they offer. Ms Lim asked whether the Government will allow such retail electricity sellers to use a tiered system. Once such a market is established, then we should leave it to the market to work out what are the different ways they can meet customer needs... If we were to introduce a tiered system today, it means Government is deciding what is an acceptable level of electricity consumption and establish that as the threshold... This is quite a problematic process in terms of determining the key levels of thresholds. So, it would be far superior to allow the market to work, for us to give targeted subsidies to those who need it and when the market is fully liberalised, the players can then work out the schemes as we see in other sectors like telecoms."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00766,2023-11-07-T-013,766,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, it was thus a key plank of the Government's strategy to bank on the open electricity market to manage electricity prices for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00767,2023-11-07-T-013,767,Sylvia Lim,"Accordingly, the open electricity market for households was rolled out in 2018, to great fanfare. This did not last. As we are all acutely aware, six retailers have since exited the market. Many were under-hedged and were stuck with lower-priced fixed rate electricity contracts while energy prices rose unexpectedly. This drove them to a loss-making proposition, leaving them no choice but to exit the market."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00768,2023-11-07-T-013,768,Sylvia Lim,"Today, most of the remaining retailers are backed by power generation companies while two others offer plans with only ""marginal price differences from the regulated tariff""."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00769,2023-11-07-T-013,769,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, in the wake of the problems with the open electricity market, the EMA tightened its requirements for open electricity market retailers in July 2023. These tighter requirements include requiring a licensee to hedge at least 80% of their contracted retail demand, set up funds to pay for premature termination of contracts and so on. A CNA report from August this year observed that these additional requirements could result in higher prices for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00770,2023-11-07-T-013,770,Sylvia Lim,"The uptake of price plans from retailers has also been slow. As of 1 March 2023, only 40.6% of residential units have adopted the retail price plan."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00771,2023-11-07-T-013,771,Sylvia Lim,"According to a report by the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, barriers to switching in the retail electricity market include complexity of the retail market and electricity tariffs, transaction costs, uncertainty of service quality and behavioural biases, among others. There is also the question of how viable it is to have many retailers competing for the relatively small domestic market in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00772,2023-11-07-T-013,772,Sylvia Lim,"As matters stand now, much uncertainty remains over the revamped open electricity market model. It is unclear whether consumers will benefit from the liberalisation of the electricity market and if so, to what extent."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00773,2023-11-07-T-013,773,Sylvia Lim,"What, then, are the other options for managing household electricity bills? So far, a large part of the Government's answer has been to distribute U-Save vouchers, mainly to HDB households."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00774,2023-11-07-T-013,774,Sylvia Lim,"While U-Save vouchers are useful, they are effectively taxpayer subsidies for certain types of households. As a complement to these measures, the Government could review its electricity tariff structures. In particular, I would ask the Government again to consider implementing a tiered pricing structure for household consumers. Further or alternatively, the Government should consider a pricing structure that is based on time of use that discourages electricity consumption at peak hours. Both of these have the potential to lower electricity costs for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00775,2023-11-07-T-013,775,Sylvia Lim,"First, tiered pricing. Tiered pricing is known in some countries as increasing block tariffs (IBTs). Under such a system, households that consume electricity below a certain threshold would be charged at a lower rate, while those consuming higher amounts would pay higher rates for the excess consumption."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00776,2023-11-07-T-013,776,Sylvia Lim,"In Singapore's context, one could set the threshold amounts, looking at the consumption patterns tracked by the EMA. Thus, for example, in deciding where to set the threshold amounts, one could take reference from the average consumption per month for 3-room HDB households, which is around 22 kWh."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00777,2023-11-07-T-013,777,Sylvia Lim,"In 2010, then Senior Minister of State Iswaran responded that tiered pricing would amount to the Government essentially deciding what an ""acceptable"" level of electricity consumption is. I do not agree with this characterisation."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00778,2023-11-07-T-013,778,Sylvia Lim,What we would be doing is to encourage energy conservation by charging a lower rate for what is deemed a basic necessity.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00779,2023-11-07-T-013,779,Sylvia Lim,"Tiered pricing of household electricity is used in many countries. To understand more about it, we could look to the benefits in several other countries where it has been implemented."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00780,2023-11-07-T-013,780,Sylvia Lim,"One such example is China. In 2012, China rolled out a tiered electricity pricing system across 29 provinces, with three tiers. The specific levels differed, depending on the province, but generally, the lowest pricing tier aimed to capture about 80% of residential households. The second tier had 15% of households while the third highest tier covered the remaining 5%."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00781,2023-11-07-T-013,781,Sylvia Lim,"A report by the China Economic Quarterly International showed that in the years following the implementation of tiered pricing, there was a 6.1% reduction in electricity consumption."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00782,2023-11-07-T-013,782,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, while each jurisdiction will decide how to set their tiers, this example shows that tiered pricing can have a positive effect in reducing overall consumption."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00783,2023-11-07-T-013,783,Sylvia Lim,"Another example is Hong Kong. Hong Kong has two major suppliers of household electricity, namely HK Electric and China Light and Power. Both of them offer tiered pricing, with as many as seven tiers. Small users pay preferential rates. According to the Hong Kong Environment and Ecology Bureau, tiered pricing is deployed for residential consumers to ""promote energy efficiency and conservation""."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00784,2023-11-07-T-013,784,Sylvia Lim,"Tiered tariffs can also be found in a host of other jurisdictions, including the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00785,2023-11-07-T-013,785,Sylvia Lim,"In fact, a World Bank study of 60 developed and developing countries showed that 60% of countries surveyed made use of tiered pricing or volumetric IBTs. The study noted that the rationale for a tiered pricing structure was to provide a ""social safety net"" whereby all consumers could assess a basic subsistence volume of consumption at a very affordable tariff, while ensuring that the revenue shortfall was covered by surcharges on the largest consumers. The study found that volumetric IBTs had ""a material effect on affordability""."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00786,2023-11-07-T-013,786,Sylvia Lim,"Mr Speaker, I note that in a more recent Parliamentary answer to a question raised by Mr Don Wee last year, the Minister for Trade and Industry again rejected a tiered pricing approach. MTI stated that electricity should be priced at its ""full cost of production and delivery"" and warned of ""inadvertent implications"". The Minister gave an example of a multi-generational household paying more if they lived in a single home, than in two smaller homes."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00787,2023-11-07-T-013,787,Sylvia Lim,"While this may be true, this phenomenon already exists in many Government policies. The larger, multi-generational household is already receiving less Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) and U-Save rebates, has less subsidies for long-term care, may be disqualified from the Silver Support Scheme and so on."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00788,2023-11-07-T-013,788,Sylvia Lim,"There is probably no policy with perfect outcomes. So, let us not let perfect be enemy of the good."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00789,2023-11-07-T-013,789,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, my second point is for the Government to look at helping households manage electricity consumption through discouraging use at peak hours. This could be done by charging lower rates at non-peak hours."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00790,2023-11-07-T-013,790,Sylvia Lim,"The EMA is already doing this for business consumers. Business consumers can make use of EMA's Demand Side Management (DSM) scheme to lower their electricity bills, by adjusting when and how much electricity they use. Businesses can participate in the Demand Response programme, where they can voluntarily reduce electricity usage when prices are high. Such behaviour also benefits the system, as it reduces the capacity required at peak periods."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00791,2023-11-07-T-013,791,Sylvia Lim,"It is well-known that a key driver of the costs of producing electricity is not the total load, but the peak hour load. Having a cheaper rate for off-peak consumption would benefit the system as a whole, as it will go towards ensuring that the peak demand can be more efficiently met by the existing transmission grid."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00792,2023-11-07-T-013,792,Sylvia Lim,"Can such differentiated peak and non-peak pricing be applied to households as well? Such time of use charging has been offered for decades around the world, in major cities including London, San Francisco and Sydney. What is its potential for Singapore households?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00793,2023-11-07-T-013,793,Sylvia Lim,"Just last month, the Government announced a pilot scheme called Residential Demand Response programme, to be launched by the second half of next year. Under this pilot programme, Singaporean households will be issued with smart meters and will receive alerts to actively reduce consumption during peak hours, in exchange for financial reward, such as rebates. This scheme is, in effect, a differential pricing scheme based on time of use."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00794,2023-11-07-T-013,794,Sylvia Lim,The Government's planned financial incentives to reduce peak hour consumption could be further developed. We could work towards a system where the electricity tariff for off-peak consumption for households is lower than the tariff for peak hour consumption. This allows households to manage their electricity costs by adjusting their time of use.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00795,2023-11-07-T-013,795,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, in making these suggestions today, it is not my intention to over-simplify the issues associated with electricity pricing, which can be a rather technical matter. Nonetheless, with the concerns about global energy supply and costs looming in the horizon, this is an issue that deserves attention."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00796,2023-11-07-T-013,796,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, let me conclude. Recent global conflicts and tensions have made Singapore even more vulnerable to rises in the prices of oil and gas, on which we rely for our energy needs. With 95% of our electricity generated from natural gas, Singaporean households are at risk of higher electricity bills. At the same time, as the Government has recently highlighted, imported supply uncertainties make it imperative for Singaporeans to conserve electricity."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00797,2023-11-07-T-013,797,Sylvia Lim,"I believe household electricity costs can be managed through adjusting the electricity tariff structure, such as through tiered pricing and differential charging to encourage off-peak consumption. Such reforms would recognise that electricity is a basic good and yet, incentivise energy conservation."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00798,2023-11-07-T-013,798,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00799,2023-11-07-T-013,799,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) supports the Motion moved by the hon Leader of the Opposition and Member Louis Chua, which calls on the Government to review its policies so as the lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00800,2023-11-07-T-013,800,Leong Mun Wai,It is especially apt to describe the ongoing inflationary pressures faced by Singaporeans as a crisis.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00801,2023-11-07-T-013,801,Leong Mun Wai,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic, when many Singaporeans are still struggling financially, the cost of almost everything in Singapore has gone up."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00802,2023-11-07-T-013,802,Leong Mun Wai,"In contrast, the Government does not seem to be too concerned about this crisis and continues to add oil to the fire. The GST hike confirmed in Budget 2022 was one of the factors that accelerated the pace of inflation as businesses took the opportunity to raise prices far more than the GST and other cost increases. Food prices have surged because NTUC FairPrice stood by instead of doing more."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00803,2023-11-07-T-013,803,Leong Mun Wai,"I still remember, in the early 1970s, I used to queue up at a community centre with my mother to buy heavily-discounted basic foodstuff and necessities supplied by NTUC. Today, NTUC FairPrice's prices are not even the lowest in the market. It is commonly known that lower prices can be found at the Sheng Siong supermarket instead. It appears that the role of NTUC and, by implication, that of the Government, has changed drastically over the last few decades. NTUC FairPrice no longer serves as the anchor of price stability. The Government, instead of being the independent referee and price stabiliser in the economy, has become a profit-seeker in direct competition with the private sector."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00804,2023-11-07-T-013,804,Leong Mun Wai,"In many sectors, the Government is the market maker and has influenced the price levels in those sectors, the most obvious and problematic one being the property market."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00805,2023-11-07-T-013,805,Leong Mun Wai,"Hence, the current cost of living crisis faced by Singaporeans is not entirely due to the global supply chain disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fact that Singaporeans have little savings to weather financial emergencies. The events after the pandemic have only exacerbated the situation that Singaporeans have been subject to by the Government over the recent decades."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00806,2023-11-07-T-013,806,Leong Mun Wai,Singaporeans have been worried about the cost of living for many years because they feel that their wages have not kept up with the cost of goods and services that they need to lead a meaningful life in Singapore.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00807,2023-11-07-T-013,807,Leong Mun Wai,"CDC vouchers, GST vouchers, Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates and so on can be very helpful for Singaporeans in the short term, but these handouts do not solve the fundamental structural issues that are at the heart of the rising cost of living in Singapore today."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00808,2023-11-07-T-013,808,Leong Mun Wai,"To help Singaporeans get out of this cost of living crisis, the PSP believes that we will need to nudge the Government to change its two favourite financial management approaches, namely, the ""pay and pay"" and ""the chicken wing for a whole chicken"" approaches."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00809,2023-11-07-T-013,809,Leong Mun Wai,"The Government's approaches may have served us well in the early days of nation-building when public finances were tight and wages rising fast. However, they may not be appropriate in today's context when wages are not rising as fast as the cost of living. It is especially worrying if more and more middle-class Singaporeans cannot keep up with the current standard of living."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00810,2023-11-07-T-013,810,Leong Mun Wai,"First, let us talk about ""pay and pay"". Many Singaporeans often jokingly refer to the People's Action Party (PAP) as a ""pay and pay"" party because it seems to run Singapore like a company and operates like a profit-seeker."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00811,2023-11-07-T-013,811,Leong Mun Wai,"PSP has spoken many times in this House that this Government has ample fiscal resources and, yet, it has always tried to justify increasing taxes and fees for public services whenever possible. PSP has objected many times to the increase in the GST from 7% to 9%. It is unnecessary, untimely and uncompassionate."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00812,2023-11-07-T-013,812,Leong Mun Wai,"While the working class will get GST vouchers, the middle class will have to pay an additional $1.2 billion in GST per year after the 2% GST hike and may have to pay even more taxes because of the GST vouchers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00813,2023-11-07-T-013,813,Leong Mun Wai,"The increase in GST is unnecessary because our fiscal position is strong as there is room to use more of the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) for current spending, instead of tucking the bulk of it in the long-term endowment and trust funds."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00814,2023-11-07-T-013,814,Leong Mun Wai,"While we agree that public services like electricity, water, public transport and so on should be operated efficiently, the ultimate objective should be to maximise long-term social benefits and not short-term profits."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00815,2023-11-07-T-013,815,Leong Mun Wai,"When Singaporeans are faced with intense inflationary pressures at the moment, the Government could have delayed the fee increases in the public services for three to five years, for example. This is especially so when the Government is expected to reap billions of windfall revenues from inflation, Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) and COEs in fiscal year (FY) 2023, apart from the fiscal buffer we have from NIRC."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00816,2023-11-07-T-013,816,Leong Mun Wai,"The Government should price public services based on long-term considerations to provide stability to Singaporeans' livelihoods, which will increase long-term social benefits."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00817,2023-11-07-T-013,817,Leong Mun Wai,"Our fiscal resources have been hoarded away in the Reserves, supposedly for the sake of the future generation. But this is to the detriment of the present generation who are facing the heavy and unnecessary burden of higher taxation and rising cost of living."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00818,2023-11-07-T-013,818,Leong Mun Wai,"We urgently need to review how our fiscal resources, including our Reserves, are being used before we contemplate raising taxes on the people. The Reserves and Budget should serve Singaporeans and not the other way around."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00819,2023-11-07-T-013,819,Leong Mun Wai,"More discerning Singaporeans have pointed out long ago that the PAP Government likes to give Singaporeans a chicken wing and then take back a whole chicken. Essentially, what it means is that the Government is a shrewd financial manager who gives out occasional short-term handouts but commits Singaporeans to long-term payment schemes that require them to pay out consistently over the long term. The total long-term payouts will be much larger than the short-term handouts."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00820,2023-11-07-T-013,820,Leong Mun Wai,"Take public housing as an example. For every Build-To-Order (BTO) flat sold, the buyer will have to pay hundreds of thousands for the land cost and have to take up a housing loan to service it. If that loan is serviced for 25 years, the buyer's CPF balance could be reduced by as much as half a million dollars. In exchange, the Government will sweeten the deal by giving out CPF Housing Grants of $30,000 to $60,000 through HDB."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00821,2023-11-07-T-013,821,Leong Mun Wai,"It begs the question why can the Government not waive the land cost so that Singaporeans can keep the half a million dollars in their CPF account for retirement instead? This is exactly what the PSP has proposed in the affordable home scheme, which waives land cost for owner occupiers of HDB flats."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00822,2023-11-07-T-013,822,Leong Mun Wai,"It is obvious that, in this way, Singaporeans' financial position will be significantly improved and that will yield a lot of social benefits."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00823,2023-11-07-T-013,823,Leong Mun Wai,"For MediShield and CareShield, the Government has also been accumulating large surpluses ahead of actual expenditures. If premiums can be reduced, Singaporeans will have more balances in their MediSave Accounts to earn more interest while they are young. PSP has proposed for the Government to pay for the MediShield and CareShield premiums all together and establish a universal health scheme for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00824,2023-11-07-T-013,824,Leong Mun Wai,"It is not an overstatement to say that ""a chicken wing for a whole chicken"" approach is the main cause of social anxiety for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00825,2023-11-07-T-013,825,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, at the launch of the Forward Singapore Festival, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that Singaporeans today no longer talk so much about the 5Cs. He said that Singaporeans still want a good material life, but the Singapore dream is also about finding fulfilment, meaning and purpose. PSP wholeheartedly agrees that there is more to life than material success and consumption. I have also spoken about self-fulfillment and ikigai, which is ""purpose"" in Japanese, in the public."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00826,2023-11-07-T-013,826,Leong Mun Wai,"But we believe that Singaporeans are no longer talking so much about the 5Cs because the structural issues in our economy and the cost of living crisis have now made the 5Cs completely unattainable for many middle-class Singaporeans even if they are frugal and work hard. Today, condominiums and cars are unaffordable on a middle-class salary. Fewer and fewer households are owning cars. Yesterday, the Acting Minister for Transport confirmed that car ownership has dropped to 33% today from 40% in 2013. Even motorcycles feel out of reach for many Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00827,2023-11-07-T-013,827,Leong Mun Wai,"It is well-known that country club membership fees have soared because of the influx of wealthy foreigners. Cash is tight because of inflationary pressures. Of the 5Cs, the credit card is the most attainable, but the credit card has fallen into a necessity to facilitate ""buy now, pay later"" when cash is tight."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00828,2023-11-07-T-013,828,Leong Mun Wai,"Singaporeans are talking less about the 5Cs not because they do not want it anymore but because for many Singaporeans today, it really can only be a dream."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00829,2023-11-07-T-013,829,Leong Mun Wai,An urgent reset of our policies is needed to address the structural issues that our economy faces. Singaporeans must have more to look forward to than the rising cost of living. Economic growth must lead to rising real incomes and better lives for everyone and not just a select few.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00830,2023-11-07-T-013,830,Leong Mun Wai,"We must help Singaporeans to improve their long-term financial well-being so that they will have the savings to withstand emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. The financial leeway will also allow Singaporeans to have the freedom to develop their potential, which will be beneficial to our economy in the long term."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00831,2023-11-07-T-013,831,Leong Mun Wai,"Over the last three years, my primary focus in this House is to speak on policies to improve the financial well-being of Singaporeans. Today, I will put all these into an integrated cost of living relief package with the following five measures."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00832,2023-11-07-T-013,832,Leong Mun Wai,"One, first and foremost, reduce GST to 7% to clearly demonstrate the Government's determination to dampen the inflationary psychology."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00833,2023-11-07-T-013,833,Leong Mun Wai,"Two, increase the immediate relief package from the current $1.1 billion to $5 billion to include financial help for the middle class and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This will also be a much-needed spending boost for the nascent post-COVID-19 recovery;"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00834,2023-11-07-T-013,834,Leong Mun Wai,"Three, introduce the affordable home scheme and Millennial Apartments scheme to make HDB flats more affordable, strengthen retirement adequacy and offer more choices to young Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00835,2023-11-07-T-013,835,Leong Mun Wai,"Four, introduce a universal health scheme for Singaporeans, essentially based on the Government-paid MediShield and CareShield premiums for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00836,2023-11-07-T-013,836,Leong Mun Wai,"Fifth, introduce a minimum living wage to give Singaporean workers a minimum take-home pay of $1,800 per month."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00837,2023-11-07-T-013,837,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, the objective of the integrated cost of living relief package is to provide a robust and substantive response to relieve the financial stress of Singaporeans, both immediate and in the long term."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00838,2023-11-07-T-013,838,Leong Mun Wai,PSP has also estimated that it is manageable with the fiscal resources we have currently. We hope the Government will make improving the financial well-being of Singaporeans the cornerstone of our new social compact. For country. For People.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00839,2023-11-07-T-013,839,Speaker,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00840,2023-11-07-T-013,840,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to state at the onset that I recognise that there is a cost of living issue. I recognise that Singaporeans are going through this, but we have to recognise that this is a global phenomenon and we have to tackle this together."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00841,2023-11-07-T-013,841,Sitoh Yih Pin,"But, Sir, I have been listening carefully and intently to the speeches made by the three Opposition Members of Parliament and my impression is that they are basically asking for an ultimate reduction in tariffs, some reduction in taxes, more top-ups, more handouts."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00842,2023-11-07-T-013,842,Sitoh Yih Pin,"This is not the first time. It did not surprise me that Mr Leong Mun Wai, again, talked about the GST."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00843,2023-11-07-T-013,843,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Honestly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Opposition Members of Parliament have been milking the GST cow for a very long time and we have explained time and again over the last several years why the GST increase is necessary and why there are offset packages. So, maybe I just want to say if you really must milk something, go and milk another cow."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00844,2023-11-07-T-013,844,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as a PAP backbencher, it is very clear in my mind that I am here to support the PAP Government's vision. I am not here to steer it. But at the back of my mind, I would like to ask the Opposition Members of Parliament if one day you are to steer this ship – I hope not, but we cannot rule it out completely – if you are to steer this ship, what is your overall underlying strategy? What is your philosophy?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00845,2023-11-07-T-013,845,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Because, so far, what I have heard is that you are basically dissecting the problem and you are talking about water, electricity, GST, so on and so forth. But at the end of the day, we need to balance the Budget and we need to balance the Budget for all Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00846,2023-11-07-T-013,846,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, as I listened to the speeches of the Opposition Members of Parliament, I cannot help but feel a sense of gloom and I am reminded of a Chinese war movie that I watched some time ago – I remember this very clearly because it struck me – it was a commander telling the troops in Mandarin, ""你知道有什么比悲哀更悲哀吗? 那就是已经绝望了, 已经没有机会了"". Do you know what is more sorrowful than feeling sorrowful and despair? It is when it becomes hopeless; it is when we no longer have a chance."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00847,2023-11-07-T-013,847,Sitoh Yih Pin,"But, clearly, this is not the situation we are in. So, I think it is important that all of us in this Chamber – PAP Members of Parliament, Opposition Members of Parliament, WP Members of Parliament, PSP Members of Parliament, Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) and Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) – come together and let us tackle this problem collectively. We have enough resources. We have overcome bigger problems."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00848,2023-11-07-T-013,848,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I noticed that the WP's Motion used the word ""crisis"", cost of living crisis. I shiver and shudder for a while when I saw the word ""crisis"" because crisis means, I think somebody is going to suggest a draw on Reserves. To me, this is a problem. It is a big problem. I would not classify it as a crisis."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00849,2023-11-07-T-013,849,Sitoh Yih Pin,"So, my point is, 我们不悲哀, 我们没有绝望, 因为我们有的是非常多的机会. That is, we are not sorrowful. We have not lost hope because we have a lot of opportunities."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00850,2023-11-07-T-013,850,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Discuss this issue of cost of living by asking three honest questions and, hopefully, by giving three honest answers also."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00851,2023-11-07-T-013,851,Sitoh Yih Pin,"The first question  is there pain amongst Singaporeans due to the rising cost of living due to inflation? And the answer is yes, there is pain. We have to acknowledge it and we have to admit this is going to be a rough and bumpy ride for all of us. It feels like a never-ending uphill battle. But, sometimes, as we overcome difficulties, there are also learning points and I am completely certain in my mind that we will overcome this. The worst may not have come yet, the worst may well come later. But never mind, we recognise there is pain and we will get over this together."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00852,2023-11-07-T-013,852,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, the second question I will ask is  having recognised that there is pain, is there pain relief?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00853,2023-11-07-T-013,853,Sitoh Yih Pin,"And the answer is, absolutely, and that is why the Government has rolled out so many packages  Cost of Living Package; Assurance Package; CDC Vouchers; U-Save rebates; Public Transport Vouchers and so on. We know them. The Government has done its best to cushion the rough and bumpy ride. But I think what we have done particularly well, maybe compared to some other countries, is that we are targeting assistance to those who need it more and I will urge the Government to continue doing that. Let us help those who need the most help and not only help them the most but maybe help them for the longest time possible. It is an unequal policy, but I think it is the right policy to adopt."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00854,2023-11-07-T-013,854,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, the next question I will ask, having acknowledged that there is pain, having said that there is pain relief, the last question I want to ask is  so, in the process, are any Singaporeans being left behind? Clearly, the answer is no."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00855,2023-11-07-T-013,855,Sitoh Yih Pin,"﻿As I have said, we will target assistance and help to those who need it more and hopefully for a longer period, and we will do the right thing. And doing the right thing is not about just policies or rules and regulations. We all know that doing the right thing is what is in your heart. And doing the right thing is – I hope the Opposition Members of Parliament will agree me – definitely not about straddling the middle ground to gain some votes. We will never do that and we do not want to start doing that."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00856,2023-11-07-T-013,856,Sitoh Yih Pin,"So, I say, let us all behave like a herd. We are the Singapore Herd because, united we are strong and divided we become weak."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00857,2023-11-07-T-013,857,Sitoh Yih Pin,"And, Sir, here I would like to admit and also acknowledge that most of us, it is human nature, we like consistency and continuity. Many of us do not like change, especially when change involves an increase in the cost of living, it involves inflation. But I think it is something we have to accept collectively. It is a global phenomenon and we will overcome this."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00858,2023-11-07-T-013,858,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, I would like to next move on to Mr Liang Eng Hwa's amendment because towards the last part, he mentioned ""without undermining our fiscal sustainability and burdening future generations of Singaporeans."" This is very important because every generation must solve its own problems. Every generation has to solve their own problems and down the road."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00859,2023-11-07-T-013,859,Sitoh Yih Pin,"And just now, the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai talked about Reserves again. I just want to say this  actually, in reality, neither him nor me are qualified to talk about our Reserves. We are only the custodians, and you know what? The Reserves are not meant for you; and neither are they meant for me. They are meant for our children and our children's children and that is why it is so important that we safeguard them."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00860,2023-11-07-T-013,860,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Like in COVID-19, if it was necessary to dip into our Reserves, we had. But I think if every time we come across a problem and a difficulty, we ask for the key to the safe and we start taking out, there is not going to be very much left in the safe, you know. I am always very marvelled by this mahjong table because on every mahjong table, there are four players and there is always a drawer there for each player. Every time I look at it – and some people put their chips on the table and some put theirs inside the drawer – my reading of it is that what is on the table are MAS and Temasek. What is in your drawer is GIC because I do not know how much you have inside the drawer."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00861,2023-11-07-T-013,861,Sitoh Yih Pin,"And it is very important that we keep our Reserves as strong as possible and maybe as mysterious as possible because when people do not know how much you have, they hesitate to mess around with you."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00862,2023-11-07-T-013,862,Sitoh Yih Pin,"My mind goes back to 1997 again. During the Asian Financial Crisis, we all know that the currencies around us were all hammered, beaten down. We got off relatively unscathed and do you really think that the hedge funds did not look at us? I am sure they did. But I think they probably say, ""You know, this little island, I do not know how much is inside that drawer, I better not mess with them because it is like throwing a boomerang. You throw a boomerang, hoping to hit the other guy, it comes back and it slit your throat."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00863,2023-11-07-T-013,863,Sitoh Yih Pin,"So, let us safeguard our Reserves and unless it is a real crisis like COVID-19, I think try not to touch it."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00864,2023-11-07-T-013,864,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to quote a famous Cantonese saying. Mr Leong Mun Wai will understand this because he is Cantonese. It goes something like ""牛不喝水，按不到牛头底 "". When the cow goes to the river and drinks, if it does not want to drink, you cannot press its head down."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00865,2023-11-07-T-013,865,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, do not worry, I am not going to talk about meat prices. I mentioned this in the context of our debate today because in a free-market economy, the price is set by willing-buyer willing-seller and it is set by basic demand and supply forces and, honestly, in Singapore, we import most of our products and we have little control. We are, basically, a price-taker although the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai just now said the Government is a price-setter. I intend to disagree. It is a price taker."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00866,2023-11-07-T-013,866,Sitoh Yih Pin,"But, fortunately, for us, we have a strong Singapore dollar and the strong Singapore dollar makes it more economical for us to import our products."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00867,2023-11-07-T-013,867,Sitoh Yih Pin,"So, Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is that as long as we stay united, cohesive, we will overcome this. We have enough experience and enough resources. There will be sunshine after the rain. We must have the guts, the gumption and the resolve to do this correctly. And rather than seek out the heat, we should look for the light and I am very confident that we will overcome this. My mind again goes back to a radio broadcast that Mr Lee Kuan Yew did, I think it was in 1961 and he said, ""It is as inevitable as the rising and setting of the sun."" So, it is as inevitable I think that we will overcome this if we stay cohesive, united and collected as a people."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00868,2023-11-07-T-013,868,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Sir, I think the long-term solution to all these, after we have overcome this cost of living problem, is that we must keep growing our economy and not only keep it going but keep it growing. And we must also continuously bake a bigger a pie so that Singaporeans can all have a bigger slice. The more vulnerable, those who need help will get it more and get it longer."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00869,2023-11-07-T-013,869,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, as we commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's birth, I like to quote him. And basically, this quote shows how important it is that we stay united as one people. And I quote Mr Lee Kuan Yew, ""For the next thousand years, we will still be here, recognisable, identifiable."" [Applause.]"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00870,2023-11-07-T-013,870,Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00871,2023-11-07-T-013,871,Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Speaker, I feel compelled to clarify what Member Sitoh Yih Pin has attributed to me and I will clarify my own."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00872,2023-11-07-T-013,872,Sylvia Lim,"My proposal actually for tiered electricity pricing is a revenue-neutral proposal. Most IBT systems are designed that way. So, it will be wrong of him to say that I am asking for more subsidies from the Government or raiding whatever fund to do that."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00873,2023-11-07-T-013,873,Sylvia Lim,"The second proposal which I suggested was about time of use pricing. And I also mentioned that MTI is already in the process of giving financial incentives to households who consume electricity at off-peak hours and they are also doing that with business consumers already. So, unless the Member is saying that conserving energy is not important for Singapore and MTI is wrong, then I think he better make himself clear."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00874,2023-11-07-T-013,874,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Thank you for the clarification, Ms Sylvia Lim. The Member said something about tiered pricing. Yes, I heard her. But I think when the Government issues the U-Save rebates, they would have achieved the same objective."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00875,2023-11-07-T-013,875,Sitoh Yih Pin,"As to the Member's second point about pricing relating to time of use, honestly, even though I did not say it just now, I think it is a good idea to consider."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00876,2023-11-07-T-013,876,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00877,2023-11-07-T-013,877,Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I, through you, confirm with Member Sitoh Yih Pin that I did not recommend a drawdown of the reserves?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00878,2023-11-07-T-013,878,Speaker,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00879,2023-11-07-T-013,879,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, if I misheard the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai, then I apologise to him. The Member did not specifically talk about a drawdown, but I think he did allude that our reserves are quite strong. And when I hear you say that, I began to shiver and shudder."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00880,2023-11-07-T-013,880,Speaker,Mr Dennis Tan.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00881,2023-11-07-T-013,881,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, as Members of Parliament, feedback from residents about rising costs of living is not uncommon. However, in the last half a year, the frequency of such feedback has really increased tremendously."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00882,2023-11-07-T-013,882,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I receive such feedback not merely from residents who are in the lower-income brackets. I also receive feedback from across the different income tiers. Recently, I attended a feedback session with some condominium residents in Hougang and concerns arising on rising costs of living were raised by many with whom I spoke to."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00883,2023-11-07-T-013,883,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, I believe I am not alone in receiving such concerns and feedback in the House. I therefore support the WP's Motion today calling on the Government to review its policy with a view to lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00884,2023-11-07-T-013,884,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,There are different issues of rising costs of living which affects Singaporeans. My colleagues in the WP will be focusing on different aspects on the rising cost pressures. I will be speaking on the need to relook some aspects of our means testing criteria in public healthcare and for more help for adults with special needs or disabilities and their caregiving families.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00885,2023-11-07-T-013,885,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, with a growing ageing population, healthcare costs are the main concerns of many, including especially many of our seniors and those with no income and yet facing health issues, and find themselves struggling to afford essential healthcare."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00886,2023-11-07-T-013,886,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,The current means testing method based on a per capita household income (PCHI) presents some challenges to certain Singaporeans. The current economic indicators applied to the healthcare means testing criteria may have their limitations. They look at household income broadly. It overlooks or deprioritises two important issues.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00887,2023-11-07-T-013,887,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"One, the formula looks at the rigid household incomes and does not look at deferring or specific needs of specific members of each household when evaluating help which should be given. While it is true that both the young, such as children and the elderly, may not have earning power or contribute directly to the PCHI, the elderly are more likely to require nursing care due to the onset of various chronic illnesses associated with ageing."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00888,2023-11-07-T-013,888,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"According to the National Population Health Survey conducted in 2020, over 20% are respondents, aged 60 to 74 years, had diabetes. Approximately 75% of those aged 70 to 74 years had hypertension and 60% in the same age group had high cholesterol. These chronic illnesses often result in increased healthcare spending, including expenses related to complications. For example, diabetes and high cholesterol are commonly associated with cardiovascular diseases, like coronary heart diseases. In fact, in 2019, approximately 75% of heart attack patients were aged 60 and above."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00889,2023-11-07-T-013,889,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Furthermore, most corporate medical insurance plans typically allow employees to include two family dependents, usually a spouse and offspring but do not permit the inclusion of elderly dependents. This exclusion is often reflected in corporate insurance plans, such as those by Raffles Medical Group, a major corporate insurance provider in Singapore. These plans specify that eligible dependents must be either a spouse or unmarried or unemployed children."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00890,2023-11-07-T-013,890,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"As a result, some households with elderly dependents may experience higher out-of-pocket medical expenses compared to households with children, even when their PCHI is the same. It is crucial that we consider such disparities in means testing."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00891,2023-11-07-T-013,891,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"One may argue that the seniors in Singapore already have access to a wide range of subsidy schemes aimed at addressing their needs, such as the Merdeka Generation Package (MGP) and the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP)."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00892,2023-11-07-T-013,892,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"However, a closer examination of these subsidies offered by these packages reveals room for improvement. For instance, the subsidies entitlement for MG and PG cardholders cover chronic conditions and dental services, but not as extensive in coverage when compared with the coverage of critical illnesses in commonly available medical insurance policies and subsidies for chronic conditions are kept annually."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00893,2023-11-07-T-013,893,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Two, it does not look at whether a family member actually do receive help from family members for their medical fees and expenses of a family member. The choice of residence for retired elderly individuals, whether they decide to stay with their working adult children or live independently, has little impact on the family's financial dynamics. Financial support from working adult children is a personal decision arrived independently of the elderly person's choice of living arrangement. As a result, a retired elderly may appear to have a high PCHI on paper, but they may not receive financial assistance from their children or adequate financial assistance from their children."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00894,2023-11-07-T-013,894,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"While the Government expects family members to pay for the living and medical expenses of family members, in reality, this may be easier said than done."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00895,2023-11-07-T-013,895,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Many residents have told me that they do not wish to impose on their children and they try to make do with what they have. Many have tried unsuccessfully to get public financial assistance when they do not receive sufficient money from their children, as their children have told them they do not have enough to contribute to their parents, including those who live with their children in the same households. How can such people receive further subsidy or assistance if help is not forthcoming from family members, without having to request from family members?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00896,2023-11-07-T-013,896,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I see the same problem with some of my residents seeking financial assistance but were not eligible because of a household income. An elderly male resident saw me a few times, crying with frustration, due to the lack of financial support as he is not eligible for more support, due to his son's and daughter-in-law's incomes and his son said that he is unable to provide more support."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00897,2023-11-07-T-013,897,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Furthermore, for healthcare means testing, beyond cases of elderly parents living with working children, there may also be other categories of core occupiers in the same household who may not be currently sharing or co-funding medical expenses of other occupiers of the property."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00898,2023-11-07-T-013,898,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"By way of an example, Mr A is in his early 60s and working part-time due to his health condition. He lives with two other higher-earning siblings. They share common household expenses, but not individual medical expenses. The household income will be a key consideration for the amount of subsidy he is entitled under the current PCHI formula. In a case like this, does the Government expect Mr A to reach out to his siblings to ask them to share his medical expenses? Will Mr A get help, maybe applies to the authorities for further subsidy?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00899,2023-11-07-T-013,899,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, currently, when the per capita household income of a particular household's PCHI is zero, the Government will look at the annual value (AV) of the property that the household is living in. In July this year, the hon Member for Aljunied GRC Mr Gerald Giam, urged MOH to consider removing the AV component for household so with no income."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00900,2023-11-07-T-013,900,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Senior Parliamentary Secretary Ms Rahayu Mahzam said in response and I quote, ""On the Member's point of considering to remove this, this is a broader point we are looking at."" I hope the Government will consider removing this."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00901,2023-11-07-T-013,901,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, households with zero PCHI but higher AVs often comprised of retirees who are in their twilight years and may have a family member who is seriously unwell and seeking medical treatment. The Minister for Health himself has acknowledged in a written answer to a PQ in February this year that AV is an imperfect proxy for determining financial need, especially for those who are asset-rich but cash-poor."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00902,2023-11-07-T-013,902,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"There may be a variety of reasons why such individual owners are unable to monetise their property. As we age, we may grow more attached to our homes, the neighbourhoods we are familiar with and the communities we have built over the years and that this may not even be the reasons for some, amongst us, for not being able to move out to a lower priced property. For whatever reasons, monetising, right-sizing or downsizing may not always be feasible or desirable. In addition, we have been encouraged to age-in-place."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00903,2023-11-07-T-013,903,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"But owners living in their own properties are not the only people who are affected by the AV issue. There are also family members who are caught by the rule. Besides non-owner spouses, there are siblings, children, aunts, uncles and cousins who may be living in the same property who may be caught by this rule. Such family members may not be able to get their relatives in the same household to pay for their medical expenses. They may not be able to afford a place of their own just to qualify or more state subsidies."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00904,2023-11-07-T-013,904,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,There are also cases of family members being co-owners of a family property or co-inheriting such property after a parent has passed on. I know a few of such cases where residents inherited a family property together with fellow family members. They continue to live in their own property. Family properties is kept for use by other family members and this could be a residential or even commercial property. And there is no near-term prospect of the property being sold and proceeds to be distributed. These non-occupier owners are caught by the AV issue when it comes to medical subsidies and also for other packages and schemes from other Ministries.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00905,2023-11-07-T-013,905,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Such people have to appeal every time against their non-access for subsidies or benefits and an outcome may not always be consistent.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00906,2023-11-07-T-013,906,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Before I leave this point, I would also say that whether a person is an owner or non-owner, it would not be right to expect a person living in a property with higher AV battling a serious disease to have to make arrangements to move out of his or her home or to sell his or her home to raise funds for the very medical treatment he or she needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00907,2023-11-07-T-013,907,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Next, Mr Speaker, I would like to discuss the needs of families who have family members with special needs or with mental health issues and requiring care for family members. The burden placed upon these families is immense and I hope that the state can extend more help."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00908,2023-11-07-T-013,908,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"While the numbers of such families may not be large, their plight is significant and warrants our attention. According to SG Enable, 3.5% of people aged between 18 and 49 in our country are disabled. These numbers are not negligible and we must recognise the challenges faced by these families."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00909,2023-11-07-T-013,909,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Moreover, data from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) estimated that in 2022, there were approximately 32,000 persons with disabilities aged between 15 and 64, with about 1,000 of them unemployed and 22,000 outside the labour force. These figures underscore the urgency of addressing their needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00910,2023-11-07-T-013,910,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Moreover, for families where such adults with special needs or mental issues require their ageing parents to continue to care for them, the burden of caregiving, both physically and financially, can be tremendous."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00911,2023-11-07-T-013,911,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,I have some suggestions to provide for better assistance to these families.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00912,2023-11-07-T-013,912,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"One, we should create a list of non-critical illnesses that necessitate long-term care and force individuals out of employment. This list would include conditions, such as early onset dementia, severe autism, Down Syndrome, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00913,2023-11-07-T-013,913,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Such conditions can be financially burdensome for families and access to social support for these individuals and their families is currently limited. For example, eligibility for claims on the CareShield Life remains limited to individuals who are unable to perform at least three activities of daily living (ADLs)."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00914,2023-11-07-T-013,914,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"However, the abovementioned ailments, while detrimental enough to put one out of employment, do not always impact one's ability to perform the ADLs. Many insurance plans cover critical illnesses and the insurance products available on the market that cover non-critical illnesses remain limited. Besides, some of these non-critical illnesses are congenital, making afflicted individuals excluded from medical insurance scheme, which require that one must be free of pre-existing medical conditions before they are onboarded."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00915,2023-11-07-T-013,915,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"The eligibility criteria of CareShield Life can be expanded to include consideration of those who can still perform ADLs but are unable to earn a stable income due to non-critical illnesses. This aligns with the original intentions of CareShield Life, which is targeted at individuals with long-term care needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00916,2023-11-07-T-013,916,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Two, for such individuals with non-critical illnesses, we should offer more subsidies with medical supplies, consultations, treatment, rehabilitation and daycare services. Medical expenses of such injuries are not limited to specialist outpatient care or inpatient care, but also included other essential areas like medical supplies and rehabilitation."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00917,2023-11-07-T-013,917,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Three, increase subsidies for inpatient and outpatient specialist treatment for both individuals with non-critical illnesses and their caregivers should be made available. While there are existing subsidies for long-term residential care, daycare and rehabilitation, many families do not meet the eligibility criteria due to the ceiling limit set by the PCHI or even the annual value of their property. For example, the PCHI upper limit to qualify for daycare subsidies set at $2,800. This can make it challenging for working adults taking care of their disabled children as their income may exceed this limit."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00918,2023-11-07-T-013,918,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Should a working adult take care of his or her disabled child because the child is not capable of independent living and let us say he or she earns about $7,000 per month, taking the median salary of someone in the 40 to 44 years old age group, and the spouse is a full-time caregiver without any income, this works out to a PCHI of about $2,333 per month. The family only marginally qualifies for 30% subsidies and entitlement for daycare services."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00919,2023-11-07-T-013,919,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Furthermore, the Senior Mobility Fund is targeted as seniors aged 60 and above, leaving out younger persons with disabilities (PwDs) who also require nursing and rehabilitation support. The younger PwDs in spite of their nursing and rehabilitation needs will not be able to access the fund. And even if the age criteria is extended to include younger PwDs, they do not qualify if the PCHI is more than $2,000 and the annual value of their property is more than $13,000."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00920,2023-11-07-T-013,920,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"In short, I am concerned that those affected are not getting enough support. There are PwDs in the working age group with rehabilitation needs and I hope the Senior Mobility Fund is extended to include these. I also hope that PwDs in the working adult age groups qualify for subtleties in daycare and residential care. Beside the opportunity cost of loss income, they should not be penalised just because they live with a working family member out of necessity."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00921,2023-11-07-T-013,921,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Four, more support should be given to caregivers of adults with special needs or disabilities. While we do have existing grants and concessions, such as the Caregivers Training Grant, Home Caregiving Grant and Migrant Domestic Levy Concession, some of these are limited to households where the care recipient is elderly and exclude families where elderly parents are caregivers to disabled children. This disparity can be addressed."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00922,2023-11-07-T-013,922,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Can caregiving grants such as the Home Caregiving Grant and the Migrant Domestic Levy Concession for aged persons with disabilities be extended the household where the care recipients are not seniors and may have no ADL issues but are involuntarily unemployed because of their medical condition. After all, the conditions that threaten employment, for example, early onset dementia, severe autism, Down Syndrome, schizophrenia and so on, are neurological or psychiatric conditions that affect soft skills, like cognitive and communication skills, and may not always affect one's ability to perform ADLs. And so, to use ADLs as an indicator and an eligibility determination for the grant is not comprehensive."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00923,2023-11-07-T-013,923,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, more help can be given to support caregivers, especially caregivers where to give up their full-time jobs to care for their family members and do not have an income or may need more financial support. For a start, I hope the Home Caregiving Grant can be increased beyond the current $400 for deserving cases."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00924,2023-11-07-T-013,924,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"In closing, Mr Speaker, I hope the current means testing formula can be further improved upon to take into account the specifics of an individual's financial situation, particularly his or her cash flow and health condition, and make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all. More help should be extended to adults with special needs or other forms of disabilities who are in the working adult age group but are unable to work and requires part or full-time care from family members, especially families where the parents are getting on in age. Mr Speaker, I support the original Motion."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00925,2023-11-07-T-013,925,Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.25 pm.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00926,2023-11-07-T-013,926,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00927,2023-11-07-T-013,927,Speaker,at 4.05 pm until 4.25 pm.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00928,2023-11-07-T-013,928,Speaker,Sitting resumed at 4.25 pm.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00929,2023-11-07-T-013,929,Speaker,
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00930,2023-11-07-T-013,930,Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00931,2023-11-07-T-013,931,Deputy Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00932,2023-11-07-T-013,932,Hazel Poa,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, post-pandemic inflation in Singapore has been much higher than it used to be. Announcements of price increases in transport fares, water and utilities came one after another. COE prices rose to record highs and GST is going to be increased by another 1% next year. Property prices and rental continued climbing. All these are adding on to the anxieties of Singaporeans over the ever-rising cost of living that seems endless."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00933,2023-11-07-T-013,933,Hazel Poa,"These anxieties cannot be alleviated by the various aid packages that the Government has rolled out, because while the packages are for a limited time, the cost increases are here to stay. The growing sense of insecurity, or even depression for some, over their declining ability to meet expenses or maintain previous lifestyles on their own income, can never be addressed with Government handouts."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00934,2023-11-07-T-013,934,Hazel Poa,"The rising cost in Singapore is not only affecting the people, but businesses too. Whilst our low corporate tax was able to compensate for our high-cost space and attracting foreign investments, this tool would no longer be available with the implementation of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0, which sets a minimum corporate tax rate. This adds on to the urgency to find ways of containing costs in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00935,2023-11-07-T-013,935,Hazel Poa,"One of our major cost component is cost of property. For most of us, buying a home is the single largest expenditure of our lifetime. Hence, high residential property price has a huge impact on our cost of living. Yet, this cost is not captured in the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, because the CPI does not cover property purchases."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00936,2023-11-07-T-013,936,Hazel Poa,"This is why the PSP has proposed a scheme to exclude land cost from the price of HDB flats to make them more affordable. In the retail sector, rental accounts for about 30% of the business cost. So, for each item that we buy from a shop, about 30% of their costs goes towards paying for the rental of the shop."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00937,2023-11-07-T-013,937,Hazel Poa,"Prices has been rising in food outlets, like coffee shops and food courts. Hawkers spoke of alarming increases in rents imposed by the landlords. Record prices in the transaction of such properties are caused for concern. In 2022, following the announcement of the GST hike, the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) was reconvened to investigate feedback on unjustified price increases of products and services."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00938,2023-11-07-T-013,938,Hazel Poa,"I was invited by the Leader of the Opposition to be the representative of the Opposition on the Committee and having attended two meetings, I have learnt how limited the scope is for this Committee to act against profiteering."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00939,2023-11-07-T-013,939,Hazel Poa,"The Committee acts on complaints received from members of the public. Such complaints are mostly against retailers, especially hawkers. At the retail level, there is much competition. So, I am not surprised that investigation usually reviewed that there are other reasons for the price increase."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00940,2023-11-07-T-013,940,Hazel Poa,"For example, the increase in price might be due to higher rents. So, the hawker is not profiteering. But is the landlord profiteering? I raise this point at our last meeting and suggested the secretariat look further up the supply chain. I look forward to hearing from MTI on the progress at our next meeting."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00941,2023-11-07-T-013,941,Hazel Poa,"Price Kaki, an app that compares retail prices from different sellers and seeks to prevent profiteering is also only able to check on vendors at the retail level. Places like Ireland, California, Canada, Scotland, Spain and China impose a cap on the rent increase each year. Austria and Germany are planning to do so as well."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00942,2023-11-07-T-013,942,Hazel Poa,"Can I suggest the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee issue guidelines on the annual rent increase, similar to the way the National Wage Council issues guidelines on wage increase? The intention is not to depress prices to low levels, but to curb excesses. This can serve to stabilise the property market and pre-empt excessive rent increase."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00943,2023-11-07-T-013,943,Hazel Poa,"In addition, real estate agents are commonly paid a commission based on the rent and, hence, higher rents work to their benefit. It would, therefore, benefit tenants to have an alternative source of information on what constitutes a reasonable rent increase."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00944,2023-11-07-T-013,944,Hazel Poa,"Another important cost component is transport cost. Record COE prices for private and commercial vehicles, and even motorcycles, are causing pain for both families and businesses."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00945,2023-11-07-T-013,945,Hazel Poa,"We understand the need to control the vehicle population in Singapore, because we are a small nation and road space is limited, but we must also recognise that mobility and the benefits that it provides are essential for all and should not be the sole province of the rich."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00946,2023-11-07-T-013,946,Hazel Poa,"Skyrocketing COE prices contribute to the cost of living crisis in many ways. If the cost of a motorcycle doubles because the price of the COE has tripled, the Grab delivery rider is going to have to be paid more for his work. The cost of shipping and delivering goods, or a ride in a private-hire vehicle, will naturally also increase."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00947,2023-11-07-T-013,947,Hazel Poa,"We urge the Government to consider the following suggestions  one, currently, passenger car and motorcycle COEs are under the zero growth policy, while COEs for commercial vehicles are allowed to grow at a rate of 0.25%. As motorcycles are increasingly used for delivery, we suggest that motorcycle COEs are also be allowed to grow at a rate of 0.25%, similar to commercial vehicles; two, adopt a points-based system, where apart from the bidding price, we also consider other factors, like nationality, and needs-based factors, like families with young children or persons with disability (PwDs); three, impose additional levies on multiple vehicle purchases, similar to the implementation of additional buyer stamp duties (ABSD) on those who buy multiple residential properties."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00948,2023-11-07-T-013,948,Hazel Poa,"The Senior Minister of State for Transport said yesterday that this would not change things much as there are not many households with multiple cars. Can the Senior Minister of State show us the comparison of the number of households with multiple cars versus those with multiple properties, to explain the difference in approach?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00949,2023-11-07-T-013,949,Hazel Poa,"In any case, imposing levies on second and subsequent cars would either dampen demand for multiple cars and tilt the balance in favour of those buying their first cars, or else raise additional revenue for Government. The most likely outcome is a combination of both. As both outcomes are desirable, I see no reason to reject this suggestion."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00950,2023-11-07-T-013,950,Hazel Poa,"Another way to cope with rising cost of living is to have higher wages. Today, I will focus on the training and education for higher-paying jobs. The wage gap between graduates and non-graduates has been widening significantly, suggesting that there is demand for more graduates and we should provide more university places for our students."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00951,2023-11-07-T-013,951,Hazel Poa,"Take the Medical Faculty, for example. The annual intake of the local medical schools is about 500. However, every year, on average, about 800 Singaporean applicants were rejected by the medical schools at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, even though they meet the admissions criteria. Why do we not increase medical intake more aggressively? Instead, our students end up going to overseas medical schools, incurring huge expenses and we risk unnecessary brain drain when they do not return."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00952,2023-11-07-T-013,952,Hazel Poa,"The traditional argument about ensuring fair share of talents in various sectors is outdated when we import foreign talents so readily. The same applies to other faculties as well, where Singaporean students are keen to study and that would lead to good paying jobs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00953,2023-11-07-T-013,953,Hazel Poa,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the issue of cost of living is a complex one but one of great importance to many Singaporeans. Many suggestions have been, and will be, made today to address this pressing issue and improve the lives of Singaporeans. I hope the Government can keep an open mind to all suggestions and consider them seriously."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00954,2023-11-07-T-013,954,Hazel Poa,"Earlier, the hon Member Mr Sitoh Yih Pin commented that the Reserves is for our children and our children's children. I think that it is important for us now to recall that our total fertility rate (TFR) has fallen to 1.05, which is half the replacement rate of 2.1. The number of our children and our children's children is halving with every generation. I think this offers a good reason to review our approach towards our Reserves and how much more do we need to accumulate. If our TFR falls further from cost pressures, who are we accumulating the Reserves for?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00955,2023-11-07-T-013,955,Deputy Speaker,Mr Mark Lee.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00956,2023-11-07-T-013,956,Mark Lee,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, our nation is undoubtedly feeling the ripples of global economic turbulence, and for many Singaporeans, the pressure on their household budgets is a source of concern. We must, and we should, take these concerns seriously, and it is our solemn duty to approach these concerns with the seriousness it deserves. It affects the daily lives of our people, the vitality of our markets and the health of our national economy."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00957,2023-11-07-T-013,957,Mark Lee,"As I hear the debates from some of the Members on the floor, like Mr Sitoh, it invokes in me images of insurmountable challenges and despair. The term ""crisis"" is a powerful one. We must, therefore, use this term judiciously, especially when the resolve of a nation like ours is called into question."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00958,2023-11-07-T-013,958,Mark Lee,"I stand today, not to minimise the concerns of our citizens regarding the cost of living, but to contextualise the narrative we choose to represent it. It is our collective responsibility to analyse and approach this issue with a clear-eyed perspective, and not through the lens of panic that the word ""crisis"" might imply."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00959,2023-11-07-T-013,959,Mark Lee,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do agree in addressing serious concerns on our cost of living, but to declare a crisis is to imply that our existing policies have faltered significantly. That our systems are in disarray and that our societal frameworks are on the brink of failure. This, I do not agree."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00960,2023-11-07-T-013,960,Mark Lee,"Singapore stands today as a global hub of commerce, a testament to sound economic principles and a beacon of stability. This did not happen by chance, but through the meticulous crafting of policies that are both robust and responsive."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00961,2023-11-07-T-013,961,Mark Lee,"Today, we stand united in our commitment to tackle a concern that lies at the core of every Singaporean's daily life – the escalating cost of living. But these are not just random fluctuations; they are the result of complex global economic trends, including widespread inflation that many countries are dealing with."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00962,2023-11-07-T-013,962,Mark Lee,"According to data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global inflation currently stands at 6.9%, having eased slightly from last year's high of 8.7%. MAS' core inflation measures stands as a testament to these challenges, with projections indicating a rate of around 4% for 2023. While we see a moderate level of inflation as a hallmark of a thriving economy, the excess erodes the economic well-being of both companies and consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00963,2023-11-07-T-013,963,Mark Lee,"The businesses that drive our economy are feeling the effects of today's unpredictable economic climate first-hand. We have seen the cost of running a business go up due to higher prices for materials and goods, a consequence of the pandemic's lingering disruption to how we get products from one place to another."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00964,2023-11-07-T-013,964,Mark Lee,"As a council member of both Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), data from our recent SBF Manpower and Wages Survey conducted in July 2023, 45% of SMEs and large enterprises expect their revenues to fall in the next 12 months, and an overwhelming 85% of companies expect business costs to increase, between 10% and 50% in the next 12 months, with SMEs projecting a deeper rise in costs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00965,2023-11-07-T-013,965,Mark Lee,"Even more unsettling is SCCCI's Annual Business Survey conducted between July to October this year, where 68% of SMEs expect to have lesser profits or losses this year, compared to last year."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00966,2023-11-07-T-013,966,Mark Lee,"Additionally, recent international tensions have caused prices for fuel and food to soar – expenses that not only affected companies, but also the daily budgets of every household. The price of rice, for example, a staple in every Singaporean home, has been subjected to fluctuations due to trade restrictions and weather-related production issues in exporting countries. These challenges are complex, but they have very real impacts on our community, from the corner store to the dinner table."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00967,2023-11-07-T-013,967,Mark Lee,"It is imperative to acknowledge that the weight of these escalating costs cannot be shouldered by the business community alone. With each incremental rise in operating expenses, there is a cascade of effects, impacting on employment, wages and the price of goods and services."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00968,2023-11-07-T-013,968,Mark Lee,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa has already mentioned that our Government has not been a passive observer to these trends. Through monetary policy, they have taken decisive steps, countering the cost of imports by allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate in a controlled manner. This is a strategic move, managing the immediate needs with medium-term outcomes, and is but one prong of their approach."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00969,2023-11-07-T-013,969,Mark Lee,"On the fiscal front, the Government have been responsive. Consider the Assurance Package enhancements announced in Budget 2023, which introduced or expanded upon several initiatives; the Cost of Living Special Payment provides a direct relief to families, helping to mitigate the immediate impact of rising prices; U-Save rebates have been a buffer for households against the increasing utility bills as energy prices soared globally. These measures are carefully designed to ensure that the additional costs are not borne by those least able to shoulder them."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00970,2023-11-07-T-013,970,Mark Lee,"The Government efforts extend beyond immediate relief. The Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) and the enhancements to the SME Co-Investment Fund exemplify the commitment to fostering a fertile environment for businesses to innovate and grow. A concrete manifestation of this commitment is seen in our investment in the tech industry, supporting the creation of high-value jobs and the development of cutting-edge products that not only serve local needs but have the potential to meet demands internationally."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00971,2023-11-07-T-013,971,Mark Lee,"As we continue to bolster our economic resilience, we must also fortify the social fabric that holds us together. This involves maintaining fiscal responsibility and optimising social support measures to effectively reach those hardest hit by cost of living adjustments. A clear example is the enhancements made to the Child Development Account (CDA), providing additional support to young families investing in their children's future."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00972,2023-11-07-T-013,972,Mark Lee,"Alongside these measures, the Government has been monitoring the business sector to safeguard against any instances of profiteering, which many consumers are concerned about. The Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) was reconvened on 16 March 2022, under the leadership of Minister of State Ms Low Yen Ling, and includes MPs, industry stakeholders and grassroots organisation representatives, actively investigating any feedback on unjustified price hikes of essential products and services."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00973,2023-11-07-T-013,973,Mark Lee,"Even as global inflationary measures are set to moderate going forward, Singapore must continue to navigate cost of living issues in a way that is responsible, effective and forward-looking. The business community urges all stakeholders in society – individuals, families, community leaders, businesses, investors and the Government, to work together in trusted partnership towards a sustainable and viable growth that all of us, as a national collective, will benefit meaningfully from."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00974,2023-11-07-T-013,974,Mark Lee,"As we look ahead, the business community call for four key shared commitments. Our first shared commitment is to understand the root causes of our cost of living challenges with clarity and precision."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00975,2023-11-07-T-013,975,Mark Lee,"We are not just facing local issues, nor can it be solely attributed to ineffective policy-making. We are dealing with the ripple effects of global market trends and geopolitical events that have affected many countries, including Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00976,2023-11-07-T-013,976,Mark Lee,"We therefore need to dissect these complex dynamics thoroughly. By doing so, we can craft solutions that are right for our unique situation in Singapore while also fitting into the larger global puzzle."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00977,2023-11-07-T-013,977,Mark Lee,"A common pitfall for many nations has been the reliance on policy-making grounded in evidence or statistics that unfortunately are reflective of past conditions rather than the present reality. Such a lag can lead to suboptimal outcomes. Take, for instance, the Federal Reserve, which, having underestimated inflationary trends, found itself compelled to implement rapid interest rate hikes."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00978,2023-11-07-T-013,978,Mark Lee,"To refine our policy-making, a more dynamic approach is called for. This could be achieved through enhanced collaboration with trade associations, ensuring a continuous dialogue and close listening ear between their diverse membership and Government policy-makers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00979,2023-11-07-T-013,979,Mark Lee,"Such a two-way exchange promises to bring real-time ground-level insights to the forefront, allowing for the crafting of more responsive and agile solutions to the economic challenges we face and allow policy-makers at times to consider slowing down the pace of implementation of certain policies that could unintentionally aggravate inflation woes."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00980,2023-11-07-T-013,980,Mark Lee,"Our second commitment is to uphold strict fiscal discipline to protect our economic future. It is essential that we sharpen the focus of our social support programmes, ensuring they deliver tangible outcomes to those most affected by rising costs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00981,2023-11-07-T-013,981,Mark Lee,"We must continue to reward innovation and productivity across all sectors. By doing so, we are not just spending money more wisely but also strengthening the foundation of our economic system."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00982,2023-11-07-T-013,982,Mark Lee,"The third cornerstone of our approach is a commitment to thoughtful policy-making, avoiding quick fixes that cause more problems than they solve. Policies must be carefully calibrated to encourage growth and increase earnings without inadvertently sacrificing the future of our children, increasing the national debt or taxes in a way that could worsen living costs, driving talents and investments away. Our aim is to create a cycle of prosperity, spurring growth that leads to better wages and smoothing out inefficiencies that inflate costs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00983,2023-11-07-T-013,983,Mark Lee,"Our fourth commitment is fortifying the bonds of our community. In a landscape where the cost of living is escalating, it is not only households that feel the strain. The repercussions extend deeply into the business community as well. Workers naturally seek higher wages from their employers to cope with their increasing expenses."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00984,2023-11-07-T-013,984,Mark Lee,"Acknowledging this dynamic, the National Wages Council has recently called for a built-in wage increase of 5.5% to 7.5% for low-income workers, raising also the minimum quantum in its 2023/24 wage guidelines. The Government has also proactively introduced the Progressive Wage Model, specifically designed to elevate the income of low-wage workers. These initiatives demonstrate a clear national resolve to uplift the standards of living for this vulnerable group."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00985,2023-11-07-T-013,985,Mark Lee,"From a business perspective, these measures might initially seem like an added strain on operational costs. Yet, the broader business community understands that these are the tenets of a new social compact that Singapore is striving to create."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00986,2023-11-07-T-013,986,Mark Lee,"In our journey to overcome and adjust to the evolving challenges of cost of living, it calls for unity and collective resolve, not division. We must resist the inclination to frame our challenges as conflicts between different segments of our society, be it local versus foreigner, business versus worker, or Government versus citizen. Instead, we must recognise that these economic hurdles are shared challenges that will be best overcome when we, as a united nation, pull together in the same direction."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00987,2023-11-07-T-013,987,Mark Lee,"Fostering this unity requires a commitment from all sectors of society to engage in open, constructive dialogue. We must break down the barriers that hinder collaboration and build bridges that allow us to share insights and develop holistic solutions. By standing in solidarity – citizens and Government, businesses and workers, locals and internationals – we can harness the full strength of our national character to address the cost of living issues in a manner that is not only effective but also equitable."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00988,2023-11-07-T-013,988,Mark Lee,"In conclusion, I thank the hon Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh, for raising this critical and important issue that affects all Singaporeans. While we acknowledge the language of ""crisis"" may capture the immediacy of the issue, we must frame our dialogue in a manner that reflects not panic but preparedness, not reaction but readiness."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00989,2023-11-07-T-013,989,Mark Lee,"The business community is convinced that the key to managing living costs effectively lies in bolstering our economic base. We must channel our efforts into enhancing our competitiveness, encouraging innovation and sustainability in businesses and elevating workforce skills. Expanding our economy's capacity in this way is crucial for our ongoing success and for our ability to provide social support."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00990,2023-11-07-T-013,990,Mark Lee,"It is through these enduring strategies that we will build an economy robust enough to support its people through every challenge, ensuring that we are always ready to lend a hand to those who need it most."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00991,2023-11-07-T-013,991,Mark Lee,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, our unity is our strength and it is together that we will craft a sustainable future where economic vitality is matched by social harmony and inclusiveness."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00992,2023-11-07-T-013,992,Deputy Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00993,2023-11-07-T-013,993,He Ting Ru,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, over the last few years, one can barely open the headlines without catching a glimpse about various crises facing our planet, ranging from the cost of living crisis that is the subject of this motion and also the climate crisis, mental health crisis and crises relating to war and conflict."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00994,2023-11-07-T-013,994,He Ting Ru,"But even when we may be faced with ""crisis fatigue"", what affects us viscerally is the surging prices of things that we need on a daily basis. Madam, in Mandarin."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00995,2023-11-07-T-013,995,He Ting Ru,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In recent years, many things have troubled Singaporeans, especially the pressure of rising living costs. This also includes rising medical and nursing costs. Among these, mental health is also an aspect that may be easy to neglect in Singapore's medical and insurance systems as it is less visible. However, mental health can have a very direct impact on the lives of individuals and their families. We must remember that if we neglect our physical and mental health for a while, we may need more complex or even expensive treatment later on and the stress we need to endure in life will also increase."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00996,2023-11-07-T-013,996,He Ting Ru,"For this reason, the Workers' Party calls for the relaxing of restrictions on using CPF savings and also to increase state subsidies for medium- and long-term care and also mental care. Some may point out that this is a waste of resources, that it will reduce personal savings that can be used for medical care in the future, and also creates dependence on the country and weakens the country's financial resources in the long run. The Workers' Party believes health cannot be understood through a cost lens alone. Health is a long-term investment in our people and the country. Preventive care or regular care today can effectively avoid future health and financial burdens. I will use my speech on the motion today to explore these issues in more depth, with the hope of improving medical services and reducing the challenges faced by Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00997,2023-11-07-T-013,997,He Ting Ru,"(In English)  The adverse impact of the cost of living crisis is seen on both mental and physical health. While humans have an immense capacity for resilience to get through difficult times, there are measurable, long-term effects on health and overall wellbeing that result from long-term stress. The imbalance in the body's physiology due to long-term stress, such as the constant worries associated with increasing costs, can lead to increased rates of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, lowered immunity, leading to greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, and also has an adverse impact on mental health."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00998,2023-11-07-T-013,998,He Ting Ru,I would therefore like to focus on the health and care related elements of the cost of living crisis facing us.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-00999,2023-11-07-T-013,999,He Ting Ru,"There is attention given to the direct link between worries over costs and the impact that it is having our ability to stay healthy and to be able to afford care, be it physical or mental health, long-term intermediate care or even preventive care."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01000,2023-11-07-T-013,1000,He Ting Ru,"A report released by Cigna in January 2023 about a global survey of 9,000 respondents also warned that cost of living pressures could trigger a global health crisis. The survey found that rising costs of living are top of mind for most people around the globe, with nearly half of respondents in Singapore saying that it was their biggest worry. Almost two thirds of the 1,100 respondents in Singapore also agreed that inflation is making it too expensive to stay healthy, whether it is through paying for care or taking measures to stay healthy."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01001,2023-11-07-T-013,1001,He Ting Ru,A study at King's College London's Centre for Society and Mental Health also found that worries about increasing costs pose a major risk to mental health and those with pre-existing mental health issues are more at risk. The study also found that those who are using savings to meet everyday costs and borrowing money to cope were correlated to psychological distress.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01002,2023-11-07-T-013,1002,He Ting Ru,"In view of this, I believe the cost of health and other forms of care is one of the areas that warrants closer attention as we tackle the broader cost of living issues."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01003,2023-11-07-T-013,1003,He Ting Ru,"While Singapore, as a nation, has increased healthcare spending as a proportion of GDP in recent years, our current spending at 4% of GDP is still less than half of the OECD average. The health outcomes we have achieved at this cost are rightly a point of pride for policy-makers. However, our country is a densely populated urban city where the cost of healthcare delivery is more easily managed compared with countries with larger and sparser geographies. Singapore's health system also benefits from a generally lower crime and drug abuse rate and road traffic fatality rate than other countries – achievements that are not to be diminished and these should definitely be maintained."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01004,2023-11-07-T-013,1004,He Ting Ru,"But I believe that our health outcomes could be improved, with Singaporeans living healthier, longer and safer lives."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01005,2023-11-07-T-013,1005,He Ting Ru,"As an example, my WP colleagues have pointed out that for many years now, even before and without COVID-19, our approach to hospital bed occupancy rates are a cause for concern, with Ng Teng Fong, Khoo Teck Puat and Tan Tock Seng Hospitals operating at near 100% occupancy just in the last week of October 2023, even though the Government has acknowledged that 85% is the academic consensus safe operating rate."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01006,2023-11-07-T-013,1006,He Ting Ru,"In terms of waiting times, medical manpower per capita, intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity in the public health system, there remains concerns about what the tensions in these areas mean for our health outcomes."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01007,2023-11-07-T-013,1007,He Ting Ru,These areas should bear continuous scrutiny to maintain confidence in our public healthcare system.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01008,2023-11-07-T-013,1008,He Ting Ru,Out of pocket costs and waiting times are the most direct interaction that most of us would have with the healthcare system. Around 70% of Singaporeans and PRs have Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) that cover private medical care and two in three have riders to pay at least a proportion of medical bills. This is indicative of residents being extremely cognisant about the potential costs associated with ill health and wanting to take action to guard against these costs.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01009,2023-11-07-T-013,1009,He Ting Ru,"A Straits Times article published in April 2022 titled ""Having an Integrated Shield Plan and rider may not always guarantee peace of mind"" warned that even buying IPs and riders may not always guarantee peace of mind and that residents might still face substantial bills should they require expensive treatment for preexisting conditions."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01010,2023-11-07-T-013,1010,He Ting Ru,Recent commentary has also focused on private insurance coverage for those with mental health conditions and there is acknowledgement that current coverage is inadequate.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01011,2023-11-07-T-013,1011,He Ting Ru,"In a reply to a question that I filed in September this year, MOH also stated that insurers cannot indiscriminately reject an application solely on, amongst others, the basis of medical conditions, including mental health conditions. I was also happy to see an article in end October 2023 where private insurers stated that they are looking to include better coverage for those with mental healthcare and treatment needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01012,2023-11-07-T-013,1012,He Ting Ru,"However, the Government should ensure that this does not cause a surge in private sector insurance bills and regulators have to be ready to step in should private insurance discriminate on various medical grounds. This is especially as inflation in medical benefits is already expected to exceed inflation in healthcare post-subsidies."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01013,2023-11-07-T-013,1013,He Ting Ru,"Insurance broker, WTW, currently projects medical benefits inflation to be 9.8% this year, outpacing the broader inflation after subsidies in healthcare, which has generally risen in line with broader inflation over the last one-and-a-half decades."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01014,2023-11-07-T-013,1014,He Ting Ru,"Next, healthcare schemes and financing are currently extremely complex and are challenging for the person in the street to negotiate. This complexity imposes a bandwidth tax. For example, an individual in the sandwiched generation will have to understand the differences in schemes for both older and younger dependents. And if they buy IP riders, they will also need to understand the interaction between public and private healthcare for each dependent. In such situations, I hope that we can try and avoid situations where one ends up over-insuring their family in order to avoid the stress of being caught out unawares."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01015,2023-11-07-T-013,1015,He Ting Ru,"Apart from continuing to work on ensuring individuals feel secure about their ability to cope with the financial aspects associated with future healthcare costs, existing financial education efforts should target this specific point and address what families can do to avoid over-insuring, including demystifying complex insurance schemes which inevitably change from time to time due to developments in the macro environment."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01016,2023-11-07-T-013,1016,He Ting Ru,"I now turn to MediSave. For those with low MediSave balances, the Government should offer more MediSave top-ups to address healthcare inflation while continuing to leverage its design which reduces wastage while cutting out-of-pocket costs for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01017,2023-11-07-T-013,1017,He Ting Ru,"In this vein, we have to ensure that yearly MediSave withdrawal limits are updated yearly to reflect inflation, as medical costs can surge rapidly in a short period of time. The headline limit was increased to $500 from $400 in 2018 and was updated in 2020 to allow patients with specified complex chronic conditions to withdraw up to $700 yearly."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01018,2023-11-07-T-013,1018,He Ting Ru,"At the time of the 2018 update, the $500 limit was enough to cover the average annual bill of a patient with three or more chronic conditions. However, we have to look to increase withdrawal limits to match healthcare inflation rates and consider allowing greater flexibility to use our MediSave savings."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01019,2023-11-07-T-013,1019,He Ting Ru,"One way to do this would be to repeat the WP’s proposal to remove the MediSave withdrawal limit for chronic disease management for those over 60, which is contained in our 2020 manifesto. And this was also raised by Aljunied MP Gerald Giam in October last year."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01020,2023-11-07-T-013,1020,He Ting Ru,A third MediSave-related point is that our savings earmarked for healthcare expenditure could be used to better support mental health treatment.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01021,2023-11-07-T-013,1021,He Ting Ru,"Anecdotally, it appears that the wait times for access to counselling, therapy and other mental health care have driven some recipients to private services. Alongside ongoing moves to grow public mental health services, can the Government consider allowing users to tap their own MediSave account for a range of private mental health treatments which would include psychotherapy, counselling and other forms of therapy like speech and occupational therapy? This would mean bringing in practices run by therapists and other professionals to allow their treatment costs to also be covered by MediSave."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01022,2023-11-07-T-013,1022,He Ting Ru,Mental health is no less important than physical health and poor mental health can lead to issues with physical health as well.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01023,2023-11-07-T-013,1023,He Ting Ru,"Since MediSave is already being approved for use for mental health services at places like Institute of Mental Health and polyclinics, I hope that we can consider expanding this to include the use of MediSave to access mental health services in other practice settings aside from purely psychiatric settings. This would be important to assist families from across the board, some of whom need to put in place early intervention strategies for their children's developmental issues, to support a multi-modal approach beyond psychiatric treatment to address neurodevelopmental, mental health conditions and symptoms."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01024,2023-11-07-T-013,1024,He Ting Ru,"Moving to intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) costs, while the issue deserves a longer intervention on its own, the move earlier this year to provide subsidies of at least 50% to all Singaporeans for palliative care earlier this year is welcome. Likewise, positive are plans to extend drug and vaccine subsidies of at least 50% to all patients of MOH-funded providers of long-term care services."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01025,2023-11-07-T-013,1025,He Ting Ru,"However, I note that nursing home care costs remain a significant area of concern, with those with per capita household income of over $2,800 a month not being able to get subsidies for nursing home care. These families would instead have to turn to private nursing homes, which can cost $5,000 or more a month."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01026,2023-11-07-T-013,1026,He Ting Ru,"The WP, in our 2020 manifesto, called for there to be more subsidies for ILTC costs to relieve the out-of-pocket financial burden of social care for families who need it."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01027,2023-11-07-T-013,1027,He Ting Ru,"With immediate cost of living pressures upon us, can the Ministry share details about the quantitative and qualitative impact the current cost of living crisis has had on the ability of households to pay for ILTC needs and what are the plans to ensure that they do not fall through the cracks and have to dial down on ILTC arrangements?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01028,2023-11-07-T-013,1028,He Ting Ru,"A next step in this revamp for subsidies would be to look again at related subsidies, for example, the Home Caregiving Grant that was brought up by Member for Hougang SMC Dennis Tan. While the grant was increased recently to now pay between $250 to $400 a month for those who satisfy the means testing criteria, the amount is hardly enough to cover care-related needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01029,2023-11-07-T-013,1029,He Ting Ru,"The means testing criteria is also strict and excludes many middle-income households. Additionally, it does not account for the loss of income or non-financial costs, such as the invisible workload associated with providing care at home for a family member."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01030,2023-11-07-T-013,1030,He Ting Ru,"Finally, I would like to touch on concerns about the cost of healthy eating in Singapore. After all, what we put in our bodies will form a strong foundation for good physical and mental health. And by eating well, I do not mean swapping our national diet for the most expensive proteins or organic foods."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01031,2023-11-07-T-013,1031,He Ting Ru,"Eating well is eating in a way that at least meets what nutritionists recommend as a bare minimum. This is already contained in the Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s My Healthy Plate guide  a quarter whole grains, a quarter good sources of proteins, half fruit and vegetables. This, as many of us know, can be challenging to do, given our carbohydrate-dominant everyday cuisine. This is made even harder for those who work or live further away from supermarkets or places where there is a range of food options to facilitate a healthy diet and can be tough on those of us who work shifts. It is also harder to address rising food costs when many do not have access to a microwave or fridge at work, which makes it more difficult to bring healthier meals from home."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01032,2023-11-07-T-013,1032,He Ting Ru,"The HPB has a Healthier Dining Programme encouraging availability and accessibility of healthier food and drink options across the island, but we can go further. For example, we can give more consideration and priority to stalls and restaurants that offer quantitatively healthier food under HDB's Price-Quality Method Tenders framework."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01033,2023-11-07-T-013,1033,He Ting Ru,"Sir, the continued cost of living crisis facing us has had an impact on our mental and physical health in the near-term and also has long-term impacts on our health and development as we grow and age."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01034,2023-11-07-T-013,1034,He Ting Ru,"We need to take steps now to help hard-working families already struggling to juggle their household balance sheets confidently deal with increases in the cost of care – health, preventative and social care – so that it does not become an insurmountable burden. With these in mind, I support the original Motion filed by the Leader of the Opposition."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01035,2023-11-07-T-013,1035,Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01036,2023-11-07-T-013,1036,Desmond Choo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the amended Motion by the hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01037,2023-11-07-T-013,1037,Desmond Choo,"Inflation and consequently elevated cost of living are very important issues. In the Labour Movement, this is a core concern that we have monitored closely over the years. The effects are felt by all – workers, consumers and businesses. Our older and lower wage workers would understandably be even more affected."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01038,2023-11-07-T-013,1038,Desmond Choo,"During our ""every worker matters"" conversation concluded recently, more than half the workers aged 50 and above and workers at 20th percentile of income, felt that they were most impacted by the price of cooked food, groceries and utilities."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01039,2023-11-07-T-013,1039,Desmond Choo,"This was exactly the items most susceptible to fall out from COVID, the Ukrainian-Russian war and other geopolitical events."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01040,2023-11-07-T-013,1040,Desmond Choo,"With so much of our inflation being imported and affected by major global events, workers and residents often wonder what can be done. Many of our workers and residents have already made lifestyle changes where possible by switching from eating out to cooking at home or by switching from private transport to public transport."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01041,2023-11-07-T-013,1041,Desmond Choo,"With our workers taking action to manage cost, national policies have also helped our workers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01042,2023-11-07-T-013,1042,Desmond Choo,"The Singapore dollar, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa has pointed out, is much stronger than many other currencies now. It is a fact not lost amongst our workers and residents who travelled in the region and beyond."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01043,2023-11-07-T-013,1043,Desmond Choo,"The Government is providing targeted support to cushion the impact of inflation, particularly for middle- to lower-income and retiree households. Our workers welcome the $10 billion enhanced Assurance Package (AP), the Cost of Living (COL) support package and the new Majulah package. The latter itself will cover 1.4 million older residents."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01044,2023-11-07-T-013,1044,Desmond Choo,"Our workers' common feedback is that there is just too many packages to remember, not that there are too many, but too many to remember. But these packages will ultimately be judged by its outcomes."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01045,2023-11-07-T-013,1045,Desmond Choo,MOF's 2022 studies suggested that the COL support measures fully covered the effects of rising prices for the bottom 40% of households and retiree households and half of the average expenditure increase for the middle 20% of households.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01046,2023-11-07-T-013,1046,Desmond Choo,"The Deputy Prime Minister also assured Parliament that the support measures combined will fully covered the increases in spending by the lower-income households this year, due to inflation and the GST rate increases and substantially cover the increases in spending by middle-income households."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01047,2023-11-07-T-013,1047,Desmond Choo,"For our lower-wage and senior workers, the Prime Minister has announced at this year's National Day Rally that there will be further enhancement to the Workfare Incentive Scheme (WIS), Silver Support and matched retirement savings schemes, with details to be announced in 2024."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01048,2023-11-07-T-013,1048,Desmond Choo,"These schemes, taken together, provide a good balance between cash and CPF MediSave savings, immediate and future needs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01049,2023-11-07-T-013,1049,Desmond Choo,"We need to deal with this current period of high inflation, but not forget the long-term structure challenges, such as the healthcare needs of an older population."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01050,2023-11-07-T-013,1050,Desmond Choo,The Labour Movement stands ready to support our workers.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01051,2023-11-07-T-013,1051,Desmond Choo,"Cost of living issues should not be tackled by the Government alone. Enterprises have their roles to play too. In NTUC, the FairPirce Group plays its time-honoured role to source and stockpile essential supplies for the nation. We can all remember how Singapore still had some goods on the shelves even in the deepest of COVID. It protects of people against price shocks experienced is so many other countries. FairPrice Group releases supplies on regular prices even if there are external global factors like logistics issues experienced during COVID that can cause huge upswings in prices. This can help to moderate domestic prices, especially during crisis."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01052,2023-11-07-T-013,1052,Desmond Choo,"The question is  what about the non-crisis time? NTUC is committed to helping Singaporeans meet this difficult inflation challenge. FairPrice, for example, has an extensive range of household brands too. In fact, 2000 items across 54 categories. They are priced at a minimum of 10% to 15% below comparable brands and quality."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01053,2023-11-07-T-013,1053,Desmond Choo,"FairPrice Group's Pioneer Generation, Merdeka Generation and CHAS blue discount schemes have brought about $65.5 million worth of savings since 2015."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01054,2023-11-07-T-013,1054,Desmond Choo,"I know the aunties and uncles in my constituency, Tampines-Changkat, are very discriminating when it comes to prices and quality. They know exactly which days to shop for the best deals and we will welcome more of them to do that."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01055,2023-11-07-T-013,1055,Desmond Choo,"But we will not rest on our laurels. In 2022, FairPrice started the ""stretch a dollar"" programme, giving a 5% discount on 100 essential items every Friday. At Kopitiam and FoodFare, prices of coffee and tea and the breakfast set were reduced or held constant throughout last year despite significant business cost increases. FairPrice and other social enterprises face the same cost pressures as any other commercial entities. So, those who use the FairPrice mobile app can also enjoy 10% off their meals at Kopitiam outlets island-wide."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01056,2023-11-07-T-013,1056,Desmond Choo,"We note keenly that lower-income workers require the most help. The Labour Movement charity and corporate philanthropy arms also provide support for low-income families and individuals. Our special assistance care fund launched in August 2022 has dispersed more than $2 million to 8,000 members to alleviate the cost of living. Across areas, such as eldercare, education, community service, our social enterprises collectively dispersed about $12 million in 2022."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01057,2023-11-07-T-013,1057,Desmond Choo,NTUC certainly does not sit idly by but leans in to care for our workers and residents.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01058,2023-11-07-T-013,1058,Desmond Choo,"On another front, just over the recent two months, the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) have launched a total of $40 million worth of funds to help residents cope with rising costs of living. This is in addition to the $600 million CDC vouchers that were issued island-wide over the past three years to support residents and small businesses. The CDCs have put in place a wide range of assistance schemes to help low-income families with food, utilities education, transport, diapers, spectacles, mobility aides and more, with the new funds, for example."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01059,2023-11-07-T-013,1059,Desmond Choo,I will go through all the five CDCs. There are some examples.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01060,2023-11-07-T-013,1060,Desmond Choo,"Residents living Central Singapore can look forward to school bus fare subsidies, a neighbourhood job scheme, assistance for families with children living in rental flats."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01061,2023-11-07-T-013,1061,Desmond Choo,"Southwest residents will get more help for education, food, transportation and daily expenses."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01062,2023-11-07-T-013,1062,Desmond Choo,"Southeast residents will have a new EduCare fund to give additional help to low-income families, to students in primary and secondary schools."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01063,2023-11-07-T-013,1063,Desmond Choo,"Northwest residents will have a new support grant. We will focus on uplifting the least privileged, providing upscaling skills, connecting partners live in community."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01064,2023-11-07-T-013,1064,Desmond Choo,"Residents in the Northeast CDC would all have new internship mentoring opportunities, comprehensive financial support for school-going children."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01065,2023-11-07-T-013,1065,Desmond Choo,"Many thanks to the donors, partners and volunteers working with us on these initiatives. And there will be more to come for our residents."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01066,2023-11-07-T-013,1066,Desmond Choo,"By coming together to work on programmes to uplift the less privilege and provide opportunities to the next generation, we not only help our families to combat inflation but also strengthen our social compact."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01067,2023-11-07-T-013,1067,Desmond Choo,"The examples of NTUC FairPrice Group and the CDC partnerships show that everyone can play a part in supporting one another to tide through difficult times. We can mitigate the impact of price increases and in doing so, strengthen our community."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01068,2023-11-07-T-013,1068,Desmond Choo,"Our overall Government policies will help to keep the increase in Singapore's food prices much lower than the increase in global food and commodity prices – below 4%, compared to 25% globally between March 2020 and May 2022."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01069,2023-11-07-T-013,1069,Desmond Choo,"There is still more work to be done, but we can do so together."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01070,2023-11-07-T-013,1070,Desmond Choo,"Beyond the broad and many-stakeholders approach in solving our cost of living issues, the most important work is to keep wages ahead of inflation – real wage increase."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01071,2023-11-07-T-013,1071,Desmond Choo,No country can shield their citizens from cost issues in the longer term and do it sustainably. There are no quick workarounds with rising costs. Many countries have resorted to things like price caps but only to abandon them when the bill size gets too monstrous.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01072,2023-11-07-T-013,1072,Desmond Choo,"The crux is to make sure that our workers can have real wage growth. This is where we must invest our resources, time and effort. So, what can we do?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01073,2023-11-07-T-013,1073,Desmond Choo,The key is a tight labour market and a productive workforce.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01074,2023-11-07-T-013,1074,Desmond Choo,A tight labour market gives workers bargaining power to command pay increases. We can keep it tight by continuing to bring in good quality investments that create jobs for Singaporeans. Our policies have resulted in record levels of direct foreign investment commitments for the last three years – even more jobs for Singaporeans.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01075,2023-11-07-T-013,1075,Desmond Choo,"Today, we have nearly 88,000 job vacancies, or two vacancies for every unemployed person; more than one in five vacancies in growth sectors with higher-paying jobs. We must continue to help our workers to secure good jobs. With no jobs, it can be worse than any inflation or inflation issues. Jobs provide dignity. Together with Workforce Singapore and NTUC's e2i, we have strengthened our job placement. We have a Job Security Council to help our people get jobs, even in the deepest of COVID-19."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01076,2023-11-07-T-013,1076,Desmond Choo,"Recently, I visited a job fair organised by the Northeast CDC and e2i. There were 1,000 vacancies on offer, not as many jobseekers. I was secretly glad to hear from the employers that they found it difficult to hire locals and that they were improving their wages and workplace conditions to out-compete rivals. These are good signs for our local workers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01077,2023-11-07-T-013,1077,Desmond Choo,"Our workforce must also be productive. A highly skilled workforce has been a cornerstone of Singapore's success and even more important in today's world, where skills are valued more than ever."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01078,2023-11-07-T-013,1078,Desmond Choo,This is not easy work because it takes years to get the policies right and see results. The Industry Transformation Maps can provide that longer-term solution.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01079,2023-11-07-T-013,1079,Desmond Choo,"At NTUC, we are glad that the Government is providing us with support to form Company Training Committees (CTCs). These CTCs are now the backbone of many companies who are tranforming their businesses, with better wage outcomes for workers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01080,2023-11-07-T-013,1080,Desmond Choo,"As shared by the Senior Minister of State for Manpower yesterday, over the last five years, between June 2017 and June 2022, real median income rose by 1.8% per annum. Real income growth at the 20th percentile saw even stronger growth at 2.9% per annum, narrowing the gap with the middle-income earner."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01081,2023-11-07-T-013,1081,Desmond Choo,"We acknowledge that sustaining such real wage growth is immensely difficult, year on year. While we might not succeed every year, we must keep our focus on longer-term growth, for longer-term well-being."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01082,2023-11-07-T-013,1082,Desmond Choo,"In providing real wage increases for our workers, we cannot do this alone. We work with our tripartite partners on the NWC to promote fair and sustainable wage increases. This year's NWC again demonstrates the resolve of tripartite partners to help workers cope with the cost-of-living increases. Amidst increases in business costs, the NWC recommended a one-off payment, a lumpsum payment for all workers to cope with cost of living, with higher amounts for lower- to middle-income workers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01083,2023-11-07-T-013,1083,Desmond Choo,"What about our lower-wage workers – the ones who need more help? We have expanded the coverage of the Progressive Wage Model. The Government co-shares the cost of wage increases with employers through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme. Today, up to nine out of 10 lower-wage workers are covered by the Progressive Wage measures."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01084,2023-11-07-T-013,1084,Desmond Choo,"This year, NWC recommended increasing the salaries of lower-wage workers by 5.5% to 7.5%, or at least $85 to $155 per month. This is higher than inflation. NWC has also recommended increases in the Progressive Wage requirements for administrators and drivers. The new requirements that will come into effect in 2024 will uplift 43,500 administrators and 8,400 drivers. So, more help is on the way."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01085,2023-11-07-T-013,1085,Desmond Choo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the world is faced with inflation in nearly every country. Some societies have been worse than others. We are glad that our policies as a whole are working. There is already light at the end of the tunnel. Based on MAS' latest projections, inflation is coming down. We are continuing to extend our different packages of support and by keeping our workflow productive, we can sustain real wages and our quality of life. With this, I support the amended Motion."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01086,2023-11-07-T-013,1086,Speaker,Mr Mark Lee.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01087,2023-11-07-T-013,1087,Mark Lee,"Sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir, I realised that I did not state in my speech. I want to state for the record that I support the amended Motion."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01088,2023-11-07-T-013,1088,Speaker,Noted. Mr Gerald Giam.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01089,2023-11-07-T-013,1089,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, Singapore faces an undeniable upward trend in cost of living, driven by factors such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, escalating energy prices and labour shortages."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01090,2023-11-07-T-013,1090,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"However, contrary to what the Member for Bukit Panjang seems to imply in his amendments to the Motion, domestic policy decisions like the hike in the GST, increases in water and electricity tariffs and rises in public transport fares, coupled with the skyrocketing cost of COEs, also contribute to the increase in the cost of living that Singaporeans are experiencing."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01091,2023-11-07-T-013,1091,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Blackbox Research's recent SensingSG survey found that 59% of Singapore residents highlighted cost of living among the two most important national and community issues.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01092,2023-11-07-T-013,1092,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Public transport costs are also a contributor to the cost of living in Singapore, making up 2.5% of MAS' core inflation basket. Over the last 10 years, the rate of increase in bus and train fares has been faster than that of core inflation. In the 2023 Fare Review Exercise, the Public Transport Council (PTC)'s fare adjustment formula produced a whopping 22.6% fare increase, although the PTC chose to cap it at 7%."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01093,2023-11-07-T-013,1093,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"This decision, though, led to the Government providing an additional subsidy to public transport operators, to the tune of about $300 million in 2023 – up from $200 million a year before. This subsidy still does not eliminate the remaining 15.6% of fare increase, which the PTC has deferred to future reviews."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01094,2023-11-07-T-013,1094,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In the meantime, public transport operators (PTOs) have continued to post eye watering profits. Between 2011 and 2022, SMRT and SBS Transit have together posted profits averaging $55 million a year, reaching $110 million in the last financial year. This is particularly jarring against the backdrop of increasing fares and Government subsidies."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01095,2023-11-07-T-013,1095,Gerald Giam Yean Song,The PTOs and our current public transport model face little competition with each other because they operate different transport routes across the island. Even duplications of the same routes for different transport modes are slowly being eliminated as bus services running parallel to new MRT lines are removed.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01096,2023-11-07-T-013,1096,Gerald Giam Yean Song,These prompt questions about the efficacy of the current fare adjustment formula and a broader discussion around the sustainability of Singapore's public transport model.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01097,2023-11-07-T-013,1097,Gerald Giam Yean Song,The current model consists of a mix of Government ownership of transport assets and operating contracts carved out among multiple profit-oriented PTOs. The model is inching more towards nationalisation than the Government would like to admit.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01098,2023-11-07-T-013,1098,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Starting in 2010, all real assets were transferred to the Government. The year 2012 saw the introduction of the $1.1 billion Bus Service Enhancement Plan. In 2013, the Bus Contracting Model saw bus services in certain areas tendered out to PTOs. This was completed in 2016."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01099,2023-11-07-T-013,1099,Gerald Giam Yean Song,The Land Transport Authority (LTA) now owns bus assets and pays the PTOs an operating fee while collecting all fare revenue and setting the service levels. The Government is now subsidising public transport services to the tune of $2 billion a year – or $1 for every journey.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01100,2023-11-07-T-013,1100,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"This mesh of responsibilities involving the operators, the regulator and the Government potentially introduces inefficiencies and additional costs. These will eventually trickle down to commuters and taxpayers, manifesting in either increased fares, higher Government subsidies, lower service coverage or all of the above."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01101,2023-11-07-T-013,1101,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Some service coverage is already being reduced. In the past three years, about 30 bus services have been shortened or removed. Such changes have affected my residents in Bedok Reservoir who continue to voice their concerns to me about long wait times and crowded feeder bus rides to the Bedok Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. Elderly commuters who favour direct trunk services, which facilitate shorter walking distances for the commute, are also affected by these changes."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01102,2023-11-07-T-013,1102,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"As the Leader of the Opposition said when moving his Motion, we need to move beyond one-time fiscal handouts and explore possible structural changes to existing policies to reduce cost of living expenses for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01103,2023-11-07-T-013,1103,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"It is therefore timely to revisit the proposal to establish a National Transport Corporation (NTC). This was first proposed by the WP in 2006. We envisaged the NTC as a publicly owned, nonprofit, multimodal land transport entity which will oversee the planning and operation of all MRT, Light Rapid Transit (LRT) and truck bus services in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01104,2023-11-07-T-013,1104,Gerald Giam Yean Song,The NTC offers many benefits over the current public transport model.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01105,2023-11-07-T-013,1105,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"First, under the NTC, the substantial profits which go to PTOs and their shareholders could instead be redirected to benefit commuters. Such revenue could mitigate fare increases and subsidise transport for the elderly, people with disabilities and low-income households, directly addressing concerns about the cost of living."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01106,2023-11-07-T-013,1106,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Second, with full access to the NTC's financial records, the Government could set fares just high enough to ensure the NTC's fiscal sustainability, without overly burdening commuters. The complex fare adjustment formula can be done away with. Fare adjustments could be introduced progressively, avoiding abrupt changes during times of economic hardship."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01107,2023-11-07-T-013,1107,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Third, the NTC could manage bus interchanges, MRT and LRT stations and their associated linkways, leveraging the rent from these prime retail and commercial areas to support its operations. This will help moderate fare increases and the need for ever growing Government subsidies."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01108,2023-11-07-T-013,1108,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fourth, the NTC could hire top transport engineers and managers, both locally and globally, based on their expertise, track records and commitment to public service."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01109,2023-11-07-T-013,1109,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Companies are fuelled by their people. Profit motives are not the sole drivers of efficiency and productivity improvements. By setting stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) and empowering these professionals, the NTC can continually improve service standards."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01110,2023-11-07-T-013,1110,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In contrast, the current penalties for PTOs' service disruptions are trivial compared to their profits and do not directly affect executive pay. The NTC's approach will see a marked improvement in performance management."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01111,2023-11-07-T-013,1111,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fifth, for transparency and accountability, the NTC should disclose its executive salaries, primary profit sources and major cost drivers, enabling the Parliament and the public to examine its financial health and hold relevant parties accountable."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01112,2023-11-07-T-013,1112,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sixth, a unified transport entity like the NTC would ensure more uniform service standards, enhanced service integration and comprehensive access to data for service improvement."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01113,2023-11-07-T-013,1113,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Utilising a vast array of commuter data, the NTC can employ artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast travel trends, dynamically directing buses and trains where they are most required. Improvement suggested by commuters in one region of Singapore could be applied island-wide."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01114,2023-11-07-T-013,1114,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Seventh, the NTC would yield economies of scale in procurement, staff allocation and technological infrastructure, leading to further savings that benefit commuters."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01115,2023-11-07-T-013,1115,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Eighth, the NTC would assume operational responsibilities currently held by the LTA, allowing the LTA to focus solely on its regulatory role, eliminating potential conflicts of interest from being both a regulator and an operator."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01116,2023-11-07-T-013,1116,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Lastly, the NTC would be given the freedom to experiment with and spearhead land transport solutions and position Singapore at the vanguard of global transport innovations. This could pave the way for Singapore to be an earlier adopter of advancements like autonomous buses or eco-friendly hydrogen-powered vehicles."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01117,2023-11-07-T-013,1117,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, the NTC is a rethink of Singapore's public transport model. It shifts us away from public transport companies that profit from Government subsidies to a non-profit, unified provider that will be more efficient and affordable for both commuters and taxpayers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01118,2023-11-07-T-013,1118,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"This new model will place the needs and well-being of our commuters at the heart of our transport policy. It will not only address the immediate cost concerns of Singaporeans, but also steer Singapore's public transport into the future."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01119,2023-11-07-T-013,1119,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, I support the Motion standing in the name of my hon friends, the Leader of the Opposition and Member for Aljunied, Mr Pritam Singh and the Member for Sengkang, Mr Louis Chua."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01120,2023-11-07-T-013,1120,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01121,2023-11-07-T-013,1121,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Speaker, Singapore has one of the lowest car ownership rates among advanced economies worldwide. In 2022, there were only 149 cars per 1,000 inhabitants here, a rate less than half that of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Taiwan, a quarter that of the UK and Switzerland, and six times less than New Zealand or the US."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01122,2023-11-07-T-013,1122,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The upshot of this, is that our streets are amongst the least congested in the world compared to global cities such as London, Chicago or Paris, where drivers spend more than 130 hours in their cars, sitting in traffic in 2022. Local commuters only lost 26 hours to jams and correspondingly less in terms of economic costs from lost time and petrol. This is admirable for a global city and one that we should not take for granted. This is evident for anyone who has had to endure rush hour in the major metropolitans of our neighbours, whether it be Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta or Manila. The major reason for this favourable anomaly is, undoubtedly, the system of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) and the Vehicle Quota System (VQS), of which, COEs are the much-reviled offshoot."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01123,2023-11-07-T-013,1123,Jamus Jerome Lim,"COE prices hit a new high in October 2023, following repeated new records set in prior months. The Open category, now changes hands at $158,000, more than five times the recommended retail price of a brand new Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla sold elsewhere in the world. This is one of the major drivers of ever-rising pressures on our nation's cost of living. And COEs were implicated in the most recent increase in headline inflation."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01124,2023-11-07-T-013,1124,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Some may argue that cars in Singapore are a luxury and a car-lite society is both better for the environment and more than made up for, by an excellent transportation system. Surely, the price of COEs is only the concern of an elite few."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01125,2023-11-07-T-013,1125,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But for middle-income families with younger children, as so many of my Sengkang residents are, a car is almost a necessity for getting kids to and from child care and school, co-curricular activities, enrichment class and weekend shopping trips. Similarly, those who are elderly or less mobile may well feel that a car in the family is less of a luxury, and more of a need."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01126,2023-11-07-T-013,1126,Jamus Jerome Lim,"And car ownership is more widespread than we may think; two in five households own one. And even for those who do not own a vehicle, the price of cars and COEs bleeds into our costs every time we hop into a taxi or book a private hire car."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01127,2023-11-07-T-013,1127,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The high prices of COEs for cars had even spilled over into that of motorcycles, at least until recently, where the relatively low costs of ownership used to be a refuge for those with more modest means wishing to have their own private mode of transport."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01128,2023-11-07-T-013,1128,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The VQS and COEs were introduced in 1990. The objective, along with ERP, was to restrain ownership so that road traffic remains smooth. Inherent in the policy is a decision to exchange certainty in congestion management, for uncertainty in prices faced by aspiring car owners, along with the possibility of inequity in access and usage. Put another way, the Government consciously chose a quota system, knowing that it could lead to rising costs. If so, it follows then, that policy-makers should step in to manage prices when they get too far out of whack."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01129,2023-11-07-T-013,1129,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Since its introduction, the system has been repeatedly tweaked. These included minor adjustments, such as tenders became monthly instead of quarterly; but others have been more consequential, such as a decision to go from closed to open bidding, to make COEs non-transferable, or the collapsing of private-car categories into the present two."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01130,2023-11-07-T-013,1130,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But the Government chose to lock in vehicle quotas – with some initial allowance for growth – at the levels associated with the new car registrations established in the years following the roll-out of the VQS. This has led to significant variations in the total quota in different years; the difference in the highest and lowest supply years has been, on average, as high as 4,300 every month."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01131,2023-11-07-T-013,1131,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In 2018, the rate of growth of cars was frozen. This means that the stock of available COEs is now indefinitely fixed, and hence, the allocation of COEs is effectively zero-sum. If you are an aspiring car owner, but are priced out of the market, then too bad for you. If a well-off family can afford to buy multiple cars for each of their children, it will come at the expense of others who are less able to do so. This could be a delivery person who may need a vehicle for work, a household with a sick or disabled member that needs a car for routine hospital appointments, or a family of five who would benefit from one ride to shuttle their kids to and from school. But the Government has emphasised that – while it aims to keep COEs affordable – they were decidedly not a tool for enhancing progressivity."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01132,2023-11-07-T-013,1132,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This capsule history lesson is instructive, because it helps us understand not only the motivations behind why a COE system was rolled out, but also, why this history has unwittingly introduced shackles that inhibits the successful and equitable functioning of the system today."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01133,2023-11-07-T-013,1133,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Perhaps the best way to think about COEs and the VQS is that it is a two-step system for controlling the vehicle population. The VQS first sets the total number of cars that ply our roads. After this is established, bidding via COE efficiently allocates the available quotas to potential car owners."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01134,2023-11-07-T-013,1134,Jamus Jerome Lim,"COE bidding requires each bidder to make offers, but only pay the price of the lowest successful offer. It was inspired by auction theory, and in particular, Nobel Prize winning insights into how best to ensure that each bidder bids as much as their own private valuations would carry them. At the same time, no bidder has any incentive to deviate from the bids that they put forward. The outcome will, in theory, not only raise the same revenue as an auction awarded to the top bidder, but also allocate these COEs efficiently."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01135,2023-11-07-T-013,1135,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This is all here and good, but herein lies the wrinkle between theory and practice. While the COE system was modeled after this so-called second-price, sealed-bid auction, real-world considerations have meant a departure from this theoretical ideal. Bidding is now open, rather than sealed. There are multiple certificates to be issued, not just one. And perhaps, most importantly, to make things easier for car purchasers, we now allow dealers to bid on the buyers' behalf, for multiple COEs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01136,2023-11-07-T-013,1136,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, the Government has made some efforts to address the recent spike in COE prices. They have tweaked supply, mainly by bringing forward confirmed five-year COE de-registrations and have increased bid deposits for motorcycles, while shortening the temporary validity period. But these have had limited effect, which is unsurprising since the moves are one-off."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01137,2023-11-07-T-013,1137,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Measures that appeared to contain prices in the motorcycle COE markets are unlikely to work for car COEs, since dealer strategies for selling cars and motorbikes differ."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01138,2023-11-07-T-013,1138,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Perhaps most importantly, the freed COEs still constitute only a drop in the bucket of the overall quota shortfall relative to high-quota years. Even with the cut-and-paste measures announced in November, as shared by Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat yesterday, my calculations suggest that these adjustments inject about 10% more COEs into supply, on average within each category per month. Whereas a more decisive cut-and-paste is required to genuinely move the needle."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01139,2023-11-07-T-013,1139,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To be clear, the Government is well aware of how relative quota differences are unequal across the years, and has been aware of this for a long time. In response to then-WP MP Mr Low Thia Khiang's query in 1998, about whether COE prices were due to such quota imbalances, then-Minister for Communications Mah Bow Tan simply explained that they were fixed at the beginning of each quota year, conveniently side-stepping the issue of whether a more balanced distribution of quotas were called for."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01140,2023-11-07-T-013,1140,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Members of the public also recognise this. A letter to The Straits Times on 14 October 2023 called for managing COE demand and supply, not alternative, newfangled systems. Another online commenter to CNA claimed that we, and I quote, ""are being penalised unnecessarily by a good system gone rogue"". Transportation experts also expressed their displeasure that the COE system has not gone through a more fundamental review to deal with changes since being introduced 33 years ago."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01141,2023-11-07-T-013,1141,Jamus Jerome Lim,"And unlike Vegas, what happens in the car COE market does not stay in the COE market. Rising COE premiums affect the prices of used cars, of course. But they also affect the cost of motorcycles, which are frequently used not only for transport, but also to make a living. High COEs also add fuel to other expenses already on fire, ranging from private hire fees to motor repair."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01142,2023-11-07-T-013,1142,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Yet, in response to a PQs filed by the hon Member Mr Yip Hong Weng in 2022, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) stated that they would not be exercising any controls on the private hire car (PHC) market. The response to another PQ filed by my hon friend Mr Louis Chua, likewise shunned the idea of restricting PHCs from the COE bidding process. Indeed, the Ministry has gone as far as to say that ""LTA has no plans to review the COE rules""."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01143,2023-11-07-T-013,1143,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Now what can we do? One approach, is to further segment the COE market in some way. This decision is not as radical as it seems. Since the scheme was first introduced, there have been changes to the number of categories, before being continually refined to the present five as I mentioned earlier."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01144,2023-11-07-T-013,1144,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Today, there are routine calls to cater to separate, specialised categories of COEs. One way would be to drop the Open category altogether, or further tweak the criteria for the other categories. One could also create a category specifically for vehicles driven primarily for commercial purposes or, as I had suggested in my speech on the Electric Vehicles (EVs) Charging Bill late last year, for EVs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01145,2023-11-07-T-013,1145,Jamus Jerome Lim,"However, one potential implication of introducing additional categories is that, depending on the distribution of demand among the potential buyers, there could well be greater upward pressure on COE prices. Overall, the evidence suggests that categorisation is often gamed, and as a result, would likely do little more to improve equity considerations. so, for me, it does not offer a substantive way forward, in terms of arresting price increases, even if it could be used to fulfil other objectives."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01146,2023-11-07-T-013,1146,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The increased pervasiveness of private-hire cars, and their number has grown almost fivefold over the past decade, has also been blamed for rising COE prices. One aggressive solution is to ban PHCs from the COE market entirely, managing their quotas separately. MOT has suggested that there is no evidence to support this argument and has even gone as far as to suggest that doing so, could even drive up costs for consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01147,2023-11-07-T-013,1147,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Even so, it makes sense to remove PHCs from regular Category A (Cat A) and Cat B bidding. Instead of banning such vehicles from the bidding process altogether, bidders for high-usage PHCs should be allowed to do so in the Open category, but be allowed to pay the respective Cat A or B prices. This is actually the current practice for taxi and cabs and given how PHCs essentially replicate many functions of the taxi – insofar as road usage is concerned – standardising the COE treatment for vehicles effectively used for commercial vehicles still makes eminent sense."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01148,2023-11-07-T-013,1148,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Of course, the practical question is how PHCs may be properly classified, if this were to be the case. I do not think that with rideshare data easily obtainable, that a data-savvy Government such as this cannot successfully make a determination between low-use PHCs – that is, cars that are only occasionally being operated as PHCs, when they do not exceeding a certain threshold of rides a month for instance – versus high-use PHCs, which are primarily operated as rideshare fleet cars. PHC drivers will be required to comply with their usage group, much like how weekend cars were restricted. And they will be monitored, by asking ride-hailing application companies to furnish these data. Only high-use PHCs would then be required to bid in the Open category."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01149,2023-11-07-T-013,1149,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Another strategy is to alter the bid structure. One such suggestion – which has previously been rejected by the Government – is to pay for exactly what one bids, instead of the lowest successful bid. Alternatively, bids could be set in terms of percentages of the open-market value of the vehicle. This system, the so-called ad valorem system, has been championed by some academics. Relatedly, categorisations could be altered and pegged not to the, say, cubic capacity or engine horsepower, but market value. Proposals of this nature are reasonable and have the added advantage of making the system more progressive. But, in my view, such proposals will make only a small dent on COE prices."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01150,2023-11-07-T-013,1150,Jamus Jerome Lim,"What would make the most impact is to smooth the vehicle quota supply by transferring excess quotas from the high-supply years to the low-supply ones, such that quotas are broadly equal across future years. Importantly, this involves more than just the marginal transfers from expected de-registrations that are largely the focal point today."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01151,2023-11-07-T-013,1151,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As mentioned earlier, the feast-and-famine nature of the COE market has long been recognised as a problem. What has made this approach even more problematic is that, in low-supply years, high COE prices discourage de-registrations since car buyers need to purchase new COEs at the high prevailing prices, whereas in high-supply years, those who have secured COEs at the high prices have incentives to sell their COEs, pocket the prorated reimbursement value while eating some depreciation, and re-enter the COE market. Both practices exacerbate the supply imbalances."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01152,2023-11-07-T-013,1152,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Hence, the existing practice of reimbursing early de-registered COEs at their the book value should end. We may even wish to reconsider transferability, since there is very little evidence that this practice actually increases speculation. But importantly, transferability should be allowed not to other car owners, but to other cars in the same category, for a given COE holder. This preserves the flexibility for car owners to sell early should their circumstances change, without introducing perverse incentives to game the system."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01153,2023-11-07-T-013,1153,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thus far, I had focused mainly on supply-side proposals. What about demand? Hopefully, it should be clear that the enormous variation in COE prices has more to do with known and alterable supply factors, rather than demand, which the data suggests are secondary. But perhaps more importantly, demand effects should be expected to moderate even further in the future, since increases in per capita incomes – which alter structural demand growth – should already be expected to moderate, given how we have already attained the status as a high-income country."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01154,2023-11-07-T-013,1154,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Still, two demand-side proposals merit further consideration. First, dealers should no longer be allowed to bid. There is substantial evidence that speculators bid up COE prices. Because dealers have a greater willingness to pass on costs – or occasionally absorb loss – they could contribute to upward price pressure, as some have suggested. Others, to be fair, have argued that dealers have an incentive to keep COE bids low, since they sell cars and COEs in a bundle, and can pocket the difference if COE prices are low."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01155,2023-11-07-T-013,1155,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Regardless, the evidence suggests that dealer intermediation has likely resulted in greater concentration in the distributor industry, and such market power is seldom good for competitive prices. After all, price discovery has already improved substantially with open bidding, thereby diminishing some of the benefits of dealer hand-holding. In my view, the presence of distributors – despite the benefits of convenience of having a one-stop shop for purchasing a car – interferes enough with auction prices as to render their exclusion the lesser evil. Better for such distributors to offer advisory and guidance, perhaps, for a fee, than be in a market-making position of collecting and making multiple bids."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01156,2023-11-07-T-013,1156,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Second, require second car purchases to be in the open category. The inequity of second or third car purchases has bothered many, and one proposal has been to apply some form of additional buyer duty on such purchases, as the Member Hazel Poa has mentioned, under the premise that these purchases – however small – could still fuel demand and push up COE prices, as my hon friend Gerald Giam has suggested. While the Ministry has declined to pursue such restrictions, one alternative – which admittedly would require some policing – would be to require households seeking a second or third car to do so in a distinct category, thereby limiting their price pressure on Cat A and B."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01157,2023-11-07-T-013,1157,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Sir, I have focused on solutions in the COE market for cars. Even so, I will reiterate what my hon friend Faisal Manap had previously shared about our position on motorcycle COEs. The issues in this category are somewhat distinct, not least because many riders are lower-income and require access not just for private transportation but to make a living. Progressivity should, therefore, be an even greater concern in this market. To this end, one is left to wonder why motorcycle growth is constrained in much the same manner as cars, given their much smaller vehicular footprint."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01158,2023-11-07-T-013,1158,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I will close, Mr Speaker. I believe that the recent cyclical high in COE prices has come at an inopportune time and has contributed to already rising costs of living. The existing VQS-COE system is broken and, while the Government has made tweaks to the system, these do not address the true underlying problem that has led to boom-bust cycles in COE prices. Let us not ignore the most important driver of supply – the imbalanced monthly quota – and some of the most prominent sources of demand, from PHCs and wealthier multiple-car buyers. Let us better manage the COE system, an important driver of rising costs of living, which is consistent with the goals of the original Motion, which I support."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01159,2023-11-07-T-013,1159,Speaker,Ms Tin Pei Ling.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01160,2023-11-07-T-013,1160,Tin Pei Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of hon Member Liang Eng Hwa's amended Motion because, firstly, the amended Motion recognises the challenges that Singaporeans and Singapore face and, secondly, it is a fairer and more accurate reflection of our reality."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01161,2023-11-07-T-013,1161,Tin Pei Ling,"Sir, cost of living is a growing concern that has affected Singaporeans and, most definitely, my residents in MacPherson. Over the past months, a recurring feedback that I received from my conversations with residents, be it during my weekly block visits or Meet-the-People Sessions, centred on the rising cost of living and the consequential pressures they face."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01162,2023-11-07-T-013,1162,Tin Pei Ling,"More residents express anxiety and worry about affording daily living needs. Anecdotally, I have received feedback, especially from seniors, on higher cooked food prices at hawker centres and more residents have approached me to seek Public Transport Vouchers and grocery vouchers, which address their basic living needs and which will free up their cash for other important expenditures."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01163,2023-11-07-T-013,1163,Tin Pei Ling,"As residents feel the pinch trying to cope with basic living expenditures, they start to worry about whether they can still support the broader needs of their loved ones and whether life aspirations, which have been spurring them on, are still within reach."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01164,2023-11-07-T-013,1164,Tin Pei Ling,These are valid concerns and we can all empathise very much.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01165,2023-11-07-T-013,1165,Tin Pei Ling,"Singapore is not alone in grappling with this issue of persistent rising cost of living. Around the world, countries are witnessing similar trends. Inflation rates are rising and the costs of essentials, such as food, energy and education, are soaring. The factors contributing to this trend are complex and multi-faceted. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these challenges, with supply chain disruptions and increased public spending amplifying price pressures."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01166,2023-11-07-T-013,1166,Tin Pei Ling,"As a small country with an open economy, we import most goods and, thus, have little influence over the prices set by others. In other words, we are price-takers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01167,2023-11-07-T-013,1167,Tin Pei Ling,"While we have little influence over prices, our Government has the capability and duty to cushion the impact on our people and support Singaporeans through difficult times. Ranging from sound fiscal policies, generous but targeted subsidies, purposeful support packages, quality education and skills training aligned to market needs, quality job creation, enabling competition to keep prices reasonable, to timely intervention to curb opportunistic profiteering, these are just some of the actions that our Government can and has taken over the years to help Singaporeans cope with cost of living."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01168,2023-11-07-T-013,1168,Tin Pei Ling,"I will not list the specific measures here, as fellow MPs have already highlighted them before, whether today or in past sessions, but I can share an example of how my resident, Mdm Ho, who is in her 40s, and her family have received Government support."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01169,2023-11-07-T-013,1169,Tin Pei Ling,"Mdm Ho, her husband and four children live in a 3-room flat. The couple are working but do not earn much and, of the four children, one is in National Service, whilst three are still in school. Mdm Ho has eczema that affects her daily life, whilst her daughter and son have medical conditions that require regular treatments at the hospital. Hence, they struggle with cost of living, like any ordinary family in Singapore. In helping them to cope, the children receive various Government support, including MOE Financial Assistance that offered the youngest child, who is in Primary school, free textbooks, uniforms, meal vouchers and transport. The older schooling children receive meal vouchers and school bursaries, on top of the Edusave and CDA monies that they already have. The family also hold blue CHAS cards and receive full Medifund coverage, so, Mdm Ho and her two children are receiving regular medical treatments at no cost at Government restructured hospitals. In addition, up until Mdm Ho found a job earlier this year, the family also received public financial assistance from the Social Services Office. These public assistances are notwithstanding other Government support, such as the GST vouchers and Assurance packages."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01170,2023-11-07-T-013,1170,Tin Pei Ling,"Though Mdm Ho and her family have been receiving various types of Government support covering different needs, there are still moments when they needed a bit more help to make ends meet. So, we mobilised our own local help schemes in MacPherson to help them tide over. These include MacPherson’s utilities support scheme, S&CC support scheme, ComCare vouchers and local bursaries. These are fund-raised by our grassroots to give extra support to our residents and their families."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01171,2023-11-07-T-013,1171,Tin Pei Ling,"I wanted to share this example because, in my opinion, the Government has been providing support to Singaporeans and families and actively responding to the evolving environment with targeted policies and programmes and that communities and individuals, too, can step in to cover last miles and close gaps."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01172,2023-11-07-T-013,1172,Tin Pei Ling,"That being said, the recent intensity of escalating cost of living does necessitate our attention and actions."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01173,2023-11-07-T-013,1173,Tin Pei Ling,"Coming back to my earlier feedback about the increase in cooked food prices, I hope more support can be given to address it, given how fundamental and intrinsically intertwined hawker centres are with our daily lives. I should clarify that the price increase was despite the National Environment Agency (NEA) not increasing rent in most cases. In fact, for one of the hawker centres highlighted to me, there was rental reduction for some of the stalls. In MacPherson, most of the hawkers have been operating there for decades and share a strong bond with our residents, especially our seniors. Hence, they make great efforts to absorb cost increments and avoid raising prices if they can help it. Yet, I have been told that some of them could not help but raise prices by up to 10% this year. If I may warrant a guess, costs must have increased at every layer of their supply chain and the pile up was too much for our hawkers to bear. Still, for a constituency with a mature population and of largely middle- and lower-income profile like MacPherson, a double-digit percentage increase in cooked food prices is highly significant. Hence, there is scope for the Government to evaluate the impact further upstream and see how best to intervene, so that micro businesses like our hawkers can better manage their costs without being compelled to pass it on to the ordinary consumers."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01174,2023-11-07-T-013,1174,Tin Pei Ling,"The Singapore Government's ability to finance increasing social spending to support Singaporeans and families is a testament to its sound fiscal policies, disciplined governance and robust Reserves. Over the years, Singapore has maintained a prudent approach to fiscal planning, with a strong emphasis on balancing the Budget and ensuring sustainable economic growth. Our Reserves also proved to be our most precious asset which saw us through the COVID-19 pandemic – the crisis of our generation."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01175,2023-11-07-T-013,1175,Tin Pei Ling,"Whilst there are obvious challenges that we still face, we have benefited from this Government’s policies in various ways. That being said, we must not undermine the stresses and hardships that ordinary Singaporeans face on a day-to-day basis. So, this Government must continue to pursue policies that will alleviate cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and families."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01176,2023-11-07-T-013,1176,Tin Pei Ling,"Looking ahead, against a challenging macro environment fraught with geopolitical instabilities and economic uncertainties, our Government must also continue pursuing policies that will build a future-ready Singapore and cultivate a resilient, versatile and capable Singaporean workforce, whilst ensuring future generations are free of burden so that they can soar high and live fully. In Mandarin."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01177,2023-11-07-T-013,1177,Tin Pei Ling,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, I support the Motion as amended by Member of Parliament Liang Eng Hwa. The amended Motion clearly reflects the challenges faced by Singapore and its citizens today, and more objectively reflects the reality of the global environment and the Government’s actual actions and intentions in the past, present and future."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01178,2023-11-07-T-013,1178,Tin Pei Ling,"As the saying goes, clothing, food, housing and transportation are the basis of people’s survival and the people are the basis of survival of the country. Clothing, food, housing and transportation are the most basic needs of the people. Against the backdrop of fast-rising prices in recent years, it is understandable that our people are worried about the cost of living."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01179,2023-11-07-T-013,1179,Tin Pei Ling,"Macpherson is a mature estate with a majority of elderly and middle- to low-income residents. Naturally, issues such as food, clothing and shelter have a greater impact on our residents. In the past year or so, in my conversations with residents, I have inevitably felt their pressure in terms of living expenses. We empathise with them."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01180,2023-11-07-T-013,1180,Tin Pei Ling,"Although this is a common challenge faced by the world, for ordinary people, it is a matter of life and death that urgently needs to be resolved."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01181,2023-11-07-T-013,1181,Tin Pei Ling,"In this regard, I believe that the Government will continue to pay attention to people's livelihoods, allocate funds and introduce targeted policies that are beneficial to the people to help them cope with various expenses."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01182,2023-11-07-T-013,1182,Tin Pei Ling,"In addition to the Government's policies and various assistance programmes, the community, private enterprises and individuals can also show kindness and help those in need."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01183,2023-11-07-T-013,1183,Tin Pei Ling,"For example, there is a 73-year-old Mdm Lim in our consistency. She is a cancer patient and is also the caregiver of her 90-year-old mother. Under normal circumstances, the pressure in terms of living expenses is not small. Fortunately, they live in a rental flat with a monthly rental of $66 , and also receive monthly subsidies from welfare organisations. Therefore, the burden of the living expenses is lighter and the medical expenses are borne by the Government. In addition, we also provide them with assistance programmes and subsidise their other daily needs, and invite them to participate in welfare activities organised by our community partners."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01184,2023-11-07-T-013,1184,Tin Pei Ling,"I do not know how many people have noticed, but I have an observation. In 2011, when I first became a Member of Parliament, I often heard elderly residents saying, in Singapore you can die, but you cannot get sick. I remember during a home visit, I met an old lady who said her husband was sick and bedridden, but because she was afraid of not being able to afford the medical expenses, she would rather let him suffer like that. I was shocked at that time. So, we launched the Macpherson Care Fund to help elderly residents cope with medical expenses and encourage them to receive treatment."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01185,2023-11-07-T-013,1185,Tin Pei Ling,"Shortly after, the Ministry of Health (MOH) introduced many policies to help Singaporeans, especially the elderly, to cope with medical and care expenses. The Government also launched the Pioneer Generation Package, the Merdeka Generation Package and now, a package for the young seniors. Every package focuses on healthcare."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01186,2023-11-07-T-013,1186,Tin Pei Ling,"In recent years, although I occasionally meet residents who are worried about medical expenses, I no longer hear the words ""you can afford to die but cannot get sick""."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01187,2023-11-07-T-013,1187,Tin Pei Ling,"Of course, we cannot underestimate the pressures faced by Singaporeans. After all, the world is not peaceful and the global economic outlook is uncertain. We cannot predict how Singapore will be affected and what impacts it will have on Singaporeans. Therefore, the Government must continue to monitor the situation and introduce policies that benefit the people."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01188,2023-11-07-T-013,1188,Tin Pei Ling,"I would like to highlight another point. As an open economy with little natural resources, Singapore needs to import almost everything from abroad. In this situation, we are not price-setters and cannot control prices. Some people may think that the Government should forcefully lower prices to benefit everyone, or that the present is more important and the Government can afford it, so it does not matter if we give more now, even if we borrow from future generations or we can use more Reserves. These ideas are dangerous."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01189,2023-11-07-T-013,1189,Tin Pei Ling,"First, the idea of forcefully lowering prices is a one-size-fits-all approach. Those who are economically able will consume more, which may lead to further price increases. Then it is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst. On the contrary, the Government's approach is to provide subsidies and assistance based on individuals’ needs and situations. This approach is more fair."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01190,2023-11-07-T-013,1190,Tin Pei Ling,"Second, the idea that it does not matter how much Reserves are used. As the saying goes, there is no perpetual good fortune and no hundred-day blooming flowers. If we recklessly use our Reserves now, who can tell for sure that we will have enough Reserves to cope with difficulties if the world encounters another economic crisis, serious pandemic or natural disaster?"
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01191,2023-11-07-T-013,1191,Tin Pei Ling,"Do not forget that during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used our Reserves several times and we still have not paid the money back. The savings left by our predecessors helped us through the most difficult times. Similarly, we must also consider the future of our descendants. In short, the Government must strike a balance between the present and the future when formulating policies, and must not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01192,2023-11-07-T-013,1192,Tin Pei Ling,Our people do face many pressures and the Government must uphold the concept of people first and implement policies that are beneficial to the people and Singapore's long-term interests. I believe that the PAP Government will continue to care for the people and govern with the long-term welfare of the country and the people in mind.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01193,2023-11-07-T-013,1193,Tin Pei Ling,I support the amended Motion.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01194,2023-11-07-T-013,1194,Speaker,Mr Faisal Manap.
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01195,2023-11-07-T-013,1195,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Mr Speaker, Sir, my esteemed Workers' Party (WP) colleagues have ﬁled the original Motion regarding the cost of living in Singapore at a time when many Singaporeans continue to feel the resulting pressures. The impact has been especially severe on lower-income households, which I believe the Government is aware of."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01196,2023-11-07-T-013,1196,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I welcome the support measures that have been announced to date towards alleviating some of these pressures, such as the top-ups to the payouts under the Assurance Package, the CDC Vouchers, the Public Transport Vouchers and so on. These measures are meant to bolster the existing social safety net."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01197,2023-11-07-T-013,1197,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The social safety net which exists in Singapore is multi-layered, which the Government referred to previously as a ""kueh lapis"", with each layer meant to tackle a speciﬁc area of need. It is an approach meant to prevent dependency, free-riding and abuse of the various measures in place. I also note that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had recently said that ComLink would be enhanced towards helping families in non-ﬁnancial ways, such as coaching. This is meant to aid social mobility and prevent further social stratiﬁcation."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01198,2023-11-07-T-013,1198,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Having all these systems in place is well and good. However, I believe it is also important that we establish a means of assessing the eﬀectiveness of our social safety net. To this end, I would like to reiterate a call I ﬁrst made back in 2014 calling for Singapore to adopt the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s Social Protection Framework."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01199,2023-11-07-T-013,1199,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"ILO's social protection approach calls for a ""fair and inclusive globalisation"" involving an ""integrated set of social policies designed to guarantee income security and access to essential social services for all, paying particular attention to vulnerable groups and protecting and empowering people across the life cycle"". There are four essential guarantees, namely, ""access to essential healthcare for all, income security for children, assistance to vulnerable groups, and income security for the elderly and disabled."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01200,2023-11-07-T-013,1200,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"If the Government would prefer a more localised framework, then it is notable that a group of academics led by Assoc Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe have published two reports on the ""Minimum Income Standard"" for households in Singapore. The latest version was released in September 2023 and provoked discussions in the media and online forums."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01201,2023-11-07-T-013,1201,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The report has a comprehensive deﬁnition for what is considered a basic standard of living in Singapore. It is about having opportunities in education, employment and work-life balance, and access to healthcare. A basic standard of living ""enables a sense of belonging, respect, security and independence, and includes choices to participate in social activities and the freedom to engage in one's cultural and religious practices."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01202,2023-11-07-T-013,1202,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In responding to the report, three Ministries, namely, MOF, MOM and MSF, released a joint statement. In that statement, they noted that what the report described was, I quote, ""what individuals would like to have"". The Government also recapped the various measures that had been taken to address the needs of lower-income households, such as the payout increases for ComCare, the Progressive Wage Model and the Majulah Package. According to the statement, the Government, I quote, ""regularly reviews the scope, coverage and the payout quanta of our schemes."""
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01203,2023-11-07-T-013,1203,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I believe that the process of reviewing the various layers of social assistance can be further improved. To this end, I would also like to reiterate my previous call for the establishment of three Social Protection steps, corresponding to 30%, 50% and 80% of the median income per household member. Based on the median income per household member of $3,247 released in February 2023, the three steps would correspond to approximately $1,000, $1,700 and $2,600. Broadly, these levels do correspond to the existing thresholds for the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01204,2023-11-07-T-013,1204,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Using the resulting statistics, I would like to propose again that MSF publish an annual Social Protection Report. The report could include information on the number of recipient households and track movements of households from one step to another, amongst other statistics."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01205,2023-11-07-T-013,1205,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"There are several good reasons for establishing a more systematic approach towards tracking the eﬀectiveness of our social assistance programmes via the Social Protection Report. It would create accountability for the use of public funds in our social assistance programmes. Rather than report on spot ﬁgures on the numbers of recipient households, the report would present a more holistic picture on the state of social protection and assistance in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01206,2023-11-07-T-013,1206,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The Government could also set objective KPIs based around the Social Protection Report. A vital KPI could be reducing the percentage of households in Steps 1 and 2 within a reasonable timeframe, perhaps within ﬁve years."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01207,2023-11-07-T-013,1207,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"If the percentages stagnate or if the report indicates a lack of progress, it could indicate a need to re-examine current approaches and identify gaps in the existing social protection system. For example, some recipient households may be in need of assistance in securing a place in a childcare centre or a student care centre for their primary school-aged children so that the parent can pursue employment without worrying about caregiving."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01208,2023-11-07-T-013,1208,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The Social Protection Report could also be useful in raising awareness among Singaporeans of the nature of the issues faced by our lower-income groups. This, in turn, could foster better coordination between Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Government agencies as they rely on a uniﬁed set of statistics and tracking tools. It may also encourage more individuals who are better oﬀ economically to step up and help their fellow Singaporeans in need by volunteering their time, energy or just making donations to aid the work of VWOs and NGOs. Sir, in Malay please."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01209,2023-11-07-T-013,1209,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Workers' Party (WP) Members of Parliament have tabled a motion suggesting that the Government review its policies with the aim of lowering the cost of living for Singaporeans and their families, especially the lower income group who are more affected."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01210,2023-11-07-T-013,1210,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In 2014, I suggested that the Government adopt the social protection framework of the International Labour Organization. I would like to repeat the same recommendation to the Government. Through the framework, the Government is able to establish policies that guarantee income security and access to essential social services for everyone, giving special attention to the vulnerable group, and protecting and empowering our people throughout their life journey."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01211,2023-11-07-T-013,1211,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"There is also another framework in the report on Minimum Income Standard published by academics, Assoc Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe. I am confident that with the appropriate framework in place, we will be able to monitor and review the effectiveness of the social assistance policies for lower-income Singaporeans. I would also like to once again suggest that the Government establish three levels of social protection, where each level matches the 30%, 50% and 80% level of median income."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01212,2023-11-07-T-013,1212,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I further recommend that the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) publish an annual report on social protection, using information that includes the number of families receiving social assistance, the number of families who have successfully progressed to a higher level, and more. With this information, we can better understand the effectiveness of the social assistance policies that exist in Singapore and also consider the need to change policies so that appropriate assistance can be provided for those in need."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01213,2023-11-07-T-013,1213,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"(In English)  Sir, the Forward Singapore report that was recently released spoke of the risk of our society becoming more stratified and less mobile as our society develops. The Government pledged to do more to ensure equal opportunities to temper unequal outcomes and prevent the creation of a permanent underclass. These are objectives I support as well."
2023-11-07-T-013-S-01214,2023-11-07-T-013,1214,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The Social Protection Framework I have proposed would complement the Government's effort to achieve this objective and track the progress of efforts undertaken towards achieving them. Sir, I support the original Motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition."

2023-11-07-T-016-S-01224,2023-11-07-T-016,1224,Speaker,Senior Minister of State.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01225,2023-11-07-T-016,1225,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, cost of living is a major concern around the world. Food and energy prices have risen significantly, caused by disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather patterns."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01226,2023-11-07-T-016,1226,Chee Hong Tat,"Many countries were affected. For instance, Germany saw natural gas prices peak in 2022, at nearly tenfold of the 2021 average. While prices have since moderated, they remain significantly above the pre-war prices. India continues to see prices spike across various food items, including essentials like rice and vegetables. From June to August this year, tomato prices surged by 1,400% at some wholesale markets."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01227,2023-11-07-T-016,1227,Chee Hong Tat,"We have experienced price increases in Singapore, too. But, thankfully, not at such magnitudes."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01228,2023-11-07-T-016,1228,Chee Hong Tat,But we have to acknowledge that inflation has affected all Singaporeans. Families need to spend more when they go to the market to buy groceries or when they have their meals in hawker centres and coffee shops.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01229,2023-11-07-T-016,1229,Chee Hong Tat,"My residents in Bishan-Toa Payoh are affected, too, including lower-income families, retirees and couples with young children and elderly parents to support. As MPs and Grassroots Advisers, we understand the pain that our residents are going through, and we feel for them and their families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01230,2023-11-07-T-016,1230,Chee Hong Tat,"On top of imported inflation, we also face rising domestic cost pressures."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01231,2023-11-07-T-016,1231,Chee Hong Tat,"We have a tight labour market and low levels of unemployment. Real wages have been rising for workers across the board. We are committed to raising the income and skills of our lower-wage workers – something I trust Members from both sides of the House will support. Through the Progressive Wage Model and other measures, the earnings of our lower-wage workers have increased faster than median wages."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01232,2023-11-07-T-016,1232,Chee Hong Tat,"But wage growth means higher business costs, especially in more manpower-intensive sectors from healthcare to food services. This has contributed to overall inflation."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01233,2023-11-07-T-016,1233,Chee Hong Tat,"Right now, inflation has peaked and is on a broad moderating path. Core inflation fell from the peak of 5.5% in January this year to 3% in September 2023. It is expected to edge down further to between 2.5% and 3% in December."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01234,2023-11-07-T-016,1234,Chee Hong Tat,"MAS expects the moderation to continue for 2024, with core inflation forecast at 1.5% to 2.5%. If we include the impact of the GST rate increase in January, core inflation for 2024 is projected at between 2.5% and 3.5%."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01235,2023-11-07-T-016,1235,Chee Hong Tat,"Fortunately, the impact of the GST increase is one-off. It should not cause an ongoing increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in future years."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01236,2023-11-07-T-016,1236,Chee Hong Tat,"These are positive signs, but the Government remains cautious because the global situation is uncertain and there are dark clouds on the horizon. Further shocks to global energy and food prices could bring additional inflationary pressures and economic slowdown. There are many uncertainties in our external environment. But what is clear is this  the Government understands the concerns of Singaporeans and we stand ready to support Singaporeans where needed."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01237,2023-11-07-T-016,1237,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the Government has cushioned the impact of global inflation on households by adopting an effective multi-pronged approach."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01238,2023-11-07-T-016,1238,Chee Hong Tat,"First, MAS moved early to tighten monetary policy significantly, substantially strengthening the Singapore dollar. This has helped to contain imported inflation and preserve our international purchasing power. Had we not done this, core inflation this year in 2023 would have been about 2.5 percentage points higher."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01239,2023-11-07-T-016,1239,Chee Hong Tat,"Second, we keep our economy competitive to create good jobs and sustain real income growth for Singaporeans. Between 2017 and 2022, real median income grew by 1.8% per year. Real income at the 20th percentile, that is, lower-income households, rose even faster, at 2.9% per year over the same period."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01240,2023-11-07-T-016,1240,Chee Hong Tat,"Unfortunately, in the first half of this year, median real income declined, even though nominal income rose slightly, as the Senior Minister of State for Manpower updated the House earlier today. This is due to the weaker economic outlook and elevated inflation."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01241,2023-11-07-T-016,1241,Chee Hong Tat,"It is understandable for median real income to have ups and downs, depending on the overall economic performance. But our experience in Singapore is that so long as our economy grows and remains competitive, real income can continue increasing for a broad segment of our workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01242,2023-11-07-T-016,1242,Chee Hong Tat,"In the long run, the key to sustaining real wage growth is to raise productivity and upgrade the skills of our workforce, to take on better jobs with higher pay. The Government has invested in many initiatives to support businesses and workers in this transformation and we will continue to do so."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01243,2023-11-07-T-016,1243,Chee Hong Tat,"Third, we ensure that basic needs like education, healthcare, housing and public transport remain accessible and affordable for all."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01244,2023-11-07-T-016,1244,Chee Hong Tat,"Everyone receives some help in these areas, but those with less receive more support. It is a fair and progressive system."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01245,2023-11-07-T-016,1245,Chee Hong Tat,"Even as inflation is moderating at the macro level, we recognise that many Singaporeans feel the pressures from higher costs of living. MPs from both sides of the House have raised this topic in Parliament, reflecting the concerns of our residents."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01246,2023-11-07-T-016,1246,Chee Hong Tat,"To our fellow Singaporeans, the Government hears you and understands your worries. That is why we have been doing more to support Singaporeans, to cushion the impact of rising prices. We review our support regularly and step in to enhance it when necessary to provide additional support, especially for lower- and middle-income families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01247,2023-11-07-T-016,1247,Chee Hong Tat,The Government enhanced the Assurance Package in Budget 2023.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01248,2023-11-07-T-016,1248,Chee Hong Tat,"As Members will recall, 2022 saw the fastest rate of increase in prices since 2008, with consumer prices going up by 6.1%, compared to 2021. To help households cope with this increase, the Government enhanced our support from the $6.6 billion announced at Budget 2022 to $9.6 billion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01249,2023-11-07-T-016,1249,Chee Hong Tat,"This way, we fulfilled our commitment to offset additional GST expenses for at least five years for the majority of Singaporean households and for about 10 years for the lower-income households."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01250,2023-11-07-T-016,1250,Chee Hong Tat,"Recently, in September 2023, the Government announced a $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package. This includes a $800 million enhancement to the Assurance Package, bringing it to over $10 billion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01251,2023-11-07-T-016,1251,Chee Hong Tat,"Singaporeans will receive the additional support from these packages soon. Every adult Singaporeans will get at least $200 in cash next month. Amongst them, about 2.5 million eligible Singaporeans will get $500 or $800 in cash. And every Singaporean household will receive $500 in CDC vouchers in January 2024. HDB households will also get more help in U-Save and S&CC rebates."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01252,2023-11-07-T-016,1252,Chee Hong Tat,"Many of my residents, including retirees who are staying in private properties, said they appreciate the additional support provided and look forward to receiving the $800 special payment in December and the $500 CDC vouchers in January next year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01253,2023-11-07-T-016,1253,Chee Hong Tat,"Through all of these packages, the Government will fully cover the increase in spending by lower-income households this year due to inflation and the GST and substantially cover the increase in spending by middle-income households."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01254,2023-11-07-T-016,1254,Chee Hong Tat,The Government provided this assurance at Budget 2023 and we will honour it.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01255,2023-11-07-T-016,1255,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, different families have different circumstances and challenges. The broad-based support that we provide will help every family, but we recognise that there may still be gaps for some households. For families who need more help, we have other supporting measures, such as ComCare and the Silver Support Scheme."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01256,2023-11-07-T-016,1256,Chee Hong Tat,"We will continue to monitor the trends closely. As we have often said, we are prepared to do more to support Singaporeans should it become necessary and we will do so in a manner which is fair, effective and sustainable for both current and future generations."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01257,2023-11-07-T-016,1257,Chee Hong Tat,The Government will continue to do our best to operate key services efficiently and keep costs of providing services as low as possible.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01258,2023-11-07-T-016,1258,Chee Hong Tat,"In the case of water, PUB incorporates successful R&D efforts into its operations to reduce costs. For instance, the upcoming Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (Tuas WRP) will generate 80% of the energy it requires for used water treatment, compared to only 25% for the conventional WRPs. This will reduce energy costs and is made possible through enhanced primary treatment of used water and co-locating with the Integrated Waste Management Facility."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01259,2023-11-07-T-016,1259,Chee Hong Tat,"Tuas WRP will also adopt membrane bioreactor technology to produce higher-quality effluent, which can be directly discharged to the sea. This avoids the need to construct a long and deep discharge pipe, which could have cost an additional $650 million."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01260,2023-11-07-T-016,1260,Chee Hong Tat,"But despite our best efforts, the cost of providing key services will be affected by rising inflation, including higher energy and manpower costs. So, the unavoidable question for us is how we want to pay for the cost increases."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01261,2023-11-07-T-016,1261,Chee Hong Tat,"It is fair for these cost increases to be borne by the users and beneficiaries of these services – if not in full, at least partially, so that they are prudent in their usage. For example, when the cost of providing electricity or water goes up, we do want users to find ways to improve energy or water efficiency and to reduce their consumption."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01262,2023-11-07-T-016,1262,Chee Hong Tat,"Even as some of these cost increases are passed on to users, the Government is mindful that we must keep basic services affordable. For essential services like public healthcare, users only bear part of the cost. When costs go up, a large part of it is paid for by the Government through increased subsidies so that the bills facing users remain affordable."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01263,2023-11-07-T-016,1263,Chee Hong Tat,"When fee increases cannot be avoided, we also provide targeted and direct support for more vulnerable groups in society, such as lower-income and retiree households. Examples would include U-Save rebates and public transport vouchers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01264,2023-11-07-T-016,1264,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, it is always tempting to ask  why not have Government simply subsidise the services themselves?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01265,2023-11-07-T-016,1265,Chee Hong Tat,"But we need to remember that the cost increases do not magically disappear as a result. They still need to be paid for, whether by taxpayers today, or by our children and grandchildren in the future."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01266,2023-11-07-T-016,1266,Chee Hong Tat,"We know from the experiences of other countries that subsidising petrol, electricity or water directly causes problems."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01267,2023-11-07-T-016,1267,Chee Hong Tat,"First, it blunts the price signals and results in over-consumption because there is less incentive to improve efficiency and reduce wastage."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01268,2023-11-07-T-016,1268,Chee Hong Tat,"Second, households will get the subsidies whether they need them or not. Furthermore, the wealthier segments of society are likely to end up getting the larger share of the subsidies, because they consume more. That is what happens when governments give out more subsidies for water and fuel. I am referring to direct price subsidies."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01269,2023-11-07-T-016,1269,Chee Hong Tat,"Who benefits more? It is inevitably the higher-income groups with bigger homes and bigger cars, swimming pools and jacuzzis."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01270,2023-11-07-T-016,1270,Chee Hong Tat,"So, the way we design our subsidies is important. Instead of subsidising the services themselves or designing tiered pricing schemes, we price the services fully, but give direct help to households that need financial assistance, in cash or vouchers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01271,2023-11-07-T-016,1271,Chee Hong Tat,"This way, we can target more help to lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. It is more cost effective and we can achieve better outcomes for society as a whole."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01272,2023-11-07-T-016,1272,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, let me now respond to some of the issues that Members have raised on water prices. I think Mr Pritam Singh would agree with me that water security is a matter of national survival. Today, Singaporeans enjoy an uninterrupted supply of high-quality water. This did not come by accident, but is made possible by long-term planning, innovation and gumption. Our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew famously said once  ""every other policy has to bend at the knee for our water survival""."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01273,2023-11-07-T-016,1273,Chee Hong Tat,"And that is precisely what happened – one of the most remarkable achievements in modern Singapore. We now have a sustainable and robust water supply system based on four National Taps. These are imported water from Johor, local catchments, NEWater and desalination. Each of these taps plays a vital role in ensuring a safe and resilient water supply. But each of these taps also faces rising costs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01274,2023-11-07-T-016,1274,Chee Hong Tat,"To safeguard water security, we need to continue making investments to upgrade and maintain the system, while stewarding our limited resources. Otherwise, the miracle that Mr Lee achieved will be short-lived."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01275,2023-11-07-T-016,1275,Chee Hong Tat,"Therefore, we must first right-price water to reflect its scarcity and to encourage its sustainable and prudent use."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01276,2023-11-07-T-016,1276,Chee Hong Tat,I was listening carefully to Mr Pritam Singh's speech earlier I do not think Mr Singh will disagree with me on this point.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01277,2023-11-07-T-016,1277,Chee Hong Tat,"Water is priced to recover the cost of its supply and production and to reflect the cost of producing the next drop of water from NEWater and desalination. Even with active cost mitigation measures by Public Utilities Board (PUB), the total cost of supplying and producing water has increased significantly."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01278,2023-11-07-T-016,1278,Chee Hong Tat,"Singapore cannot compromise on having a high-quality and reliable water supply. It is for our national survival. It is necessary to revise the water price now to catch up with these cost increases. Deferring the price increase now will only result in a widening cost gap, that has to be made up by larger, more significant price increases in future."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01279,2023-11-07-T-016,1279,Chee Hong Tat,"To cushion the impact of higher water price in 2024 and 2025, the Government will provide eligible Singaporean HDB households an additional $20 per quarter of U-Save from January 2024 to December 2025, or a total of $80 per year for two years."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01280,2023-11-07-T-016,1280,Chee Hong Tat,"The additional U-Save rebates will, on average, fully offset the increase in utility bills for 1- to 2- room flats and about 80% for 3- to 4- room HDB flats and about 65% for larger flats. On average, this translates to 3- to 4- room HDB flats paying about $2 more per month and 5-room HDB and larger households paying about $4 more per month."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01281,2023-11-07-T-016,1281,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the WP also suggested having additional tiers for water price. As I mentioned earlier, we price water to reflect its scarcity value. This means the same rate is paid by everyone, from the very first drop used by the household, so that all users take into account the scarcity value of water. To discourage excessive use and to send a message to households on water conservation, we set a higher price for water consumption that far exceeds the average household consumption level. And as Mr Pritam Singh pointed out, this threshold is set at 40 cubic metres a month to accommodate most household needs. Over 96% of households consume less than this threshold."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01282,2023-11-07-T-016,1282,Chee Hong Tat,"Having additional tiers below 40 cubic metres would mean that all households, rich or poor, pay a water price lower than its scarcity value for the first block of consumption. Or, if you have even more tiers, then, across the different tiers, the water that is being consumed at the lower tiers will also include a subsidy to the wealthier families that consume more water."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01283,2023-11-07-T-016,1283,Chee Hong Tat,"This would distort the households' incentive to conserve water from the very first drop. It also means that the Government will have to subsidise everyone for water, not just the lower- and middle- income, which is more costly and inefficient."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01284,2023-11-07-T-016,1284,Chee Hong Tat,"Instead, the Government's approach is to price water fully. Then, we provide targeted and tiered support though our U-Save rebates to those who need it most. Lower-income families staying in smaller flats get a larger rebate, as I shared earlier, which effectively translates into a lower price for them."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01285,2023-11-07-T-016,1285,Chee Hong Tat,"Businesses do not receive U-Save rebates. We do not subsidise their water or electricity consumption. Instead, we work with them, including helping our SMEs to be more energy and water efficient."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01286,2023-11-07-T-016,1286,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, we also cannot have our cake and eat it. If the Government provides broad-based subsidies for all households through a multiple-tier water price, we cannot then also give out U-Save rebates for the same purpose."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01287,2023-11-07-T-016,1287,Chee Hong Tat,"The experiences of other countries have shown clearly that broad-based subsidies can lead to wasteful and ineffective outcomes. The Government is unable, after spending on these subsidies, to have sufficient resources left to provide more targeted help to those who really need it."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01288,2023-11-07-T-016,1288,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, the same rationale applies to electricity. We have taken steps over the years to strengthen our energy resilience to ensure supply stability and continuity, and this is an important task that MTI, EMA and the power sector has taken on."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01289,2023-11-07-T-016,1289,Chee Hong Tat,"The tariff, as Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned, should reflect the cost of producing electricity from the first electron. Just as water, we want to price it correctly from the first drop. And then, what we do, similar to water, is we then provide means tested U-Save rebates to help families, especially lower- and middle-income families, give them more help, give them more support."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01290,2023-11-07-T-016,1290,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Ms Sylvia Lim's idea of time-of-use pricing is something which we do agree with. And that is why MTI and EMA have also announced an initiative as Ms Lim had mentioned in her speech. This is an accurate reflection of the actual cost of producing electricity during different periods of the day."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01291,2023-11-07-T-016,1291,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I would now turn to GST. Overall, we have provided high quality public services to Singaporeans and we have achieved good outcomes for our programmes, and we were able to do so, despite having an annual Budget that is less than 20% of Gross Domestic Product, which is much lower than most advanced economies."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01292,2023-11-07-T-016,1292,Chee Hong Tat,"Nevertheless, the Government's spending needs are rising steadily, especially healthcare costs as our society ages. There is therefore a need to raise revenues to pay for these higher expenditures. We have explained this in the House and also elsewhere many times."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01293,2023-11-07-T-016,1293,Chee Hong Tat,"The Opposition has once again asked if we can defer the GST increase, especially given our higher-than-expected revenues. This too has been debated thoroughly in this House. I think it is important to set out once more the Government's philosophy behind the GST system."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01294,2023-11-07-T-016,1294,Chee Hong Tat,"First, the GST is a critical component of our tax system and we are raising the GST not for immediate funding needs, but for our medium-term needs. This includes rising social spending in areas such as increased healthcare for our ageing population and more support for vulnerable segments of society."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01295,2023-11-07-T-016,1295,Chee Hong Tat,"Second, we design our GST system to take care of the lower-income. In 2012, we made the GST voucher (GSTV) scheme permanent. The GSTV provides bigger offsets to lower-income households. Coupled with the absorption of GST on publicly subsidised healthcare and education, we achieve an outcome where lower-income Singaporean households face a lower effective GST rate than higher-income ones."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01296,2023-11-07-T-016,1296,Chee Hong Tat,"As we had shared in this House previously, the bulk of the GST revenues are paid by higher-income groups, as well as foreigners and tourists."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01297,2023-11-07-T-016,1297,Chee Hong Tat,"Third, we are able to defer the impact of the GST raises because of the comprehensive Assurance Package which benefits all Singaporean households. The Assurance Package will defer the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households by at least five years. For lower-income households, we will defer the GST increase for them by about 10 years. Since launching the Assurance Package in 2022, we have enhanced it twice to uphold this Government's commitment."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01298,2023-11-07-T-016,1298,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, we have gone through these points in this House before many times. And while the WP has consistently objected to the GST in previous years, we are glad that at the debate on the President's Address in April this year, the WP has acknowledged the need for a 7% GST. And earlier, I heard Mr Leong Mun Wai saying he also agrees with the 7% GST."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01299,2023-11-07-T-016,1299,Chee Hong Tat,"But the WP and the PSP should be upfront and consistent. It cannot have it both ways, objecting each time the GST rate needs to go up, but wanting to keep and spend the revenues from previous GST increases. The only disagreement, based on my understanding that the Opposition now has, is to ask if we could defer the GST increase, because we have higher-than-expected revenues."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01300,2023-11-07-T-016,1300,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I ask the Opposition to please look at the broader and longer-term fiscal trends. We may have had a good year this FY, but we do not have a structural surplus."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01301,2023-11-07-T-016,1301,Chee Hong Tat,Our fiscal expenditures have been rising steadily and will continue to increase and we are almost certain to face a funding gap in the coming years if we do nothing about it. MOF had published an Occasional Paper earlier this year to highlight this trend.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01302,2023-11-07-T-016,1302,Chee Hong Tat,"We are expecting more social spending, in healthcare for our ageing population and to better support vulnerable groups in Singapore. Without the GST increase and tax measures announced in the last two Budgets, we would not be able to close the projected fiscal gap."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01303,2023-11-07-T-016,1303,Chee Hong Tat,"We have been fortunate to have higher-than-expected revenues in FY22. The Government did not plan its Budget on the basis that we will have these unexpected upsides in revenue collections. These were either sentiment-based revenues which are volatile from year-to-year, or due to higher-than-expected economic growth."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01304,2023-11-07-T-016,1304,Chee Hong Tat,"And when we have these surpluses, the Government has made good use of them by flowing back these upsides to support businesses and households. We have done this during Budget and through off-Budget support packages."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01305,2023-11-07-T-016,1305,Chee Hong Tat,"We also allocated some of these surpluses into Funds for specific needs, such as the ComCare Endowment Fund to provide support to our lower-income families, or the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund to protect ourselves against sea level rises."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01306,2023-11-07-T-016,1306,Chee Hong Tat,"But we should follow through, to raise the GST to 9% on 1 January 2024. We can be confident that households will be amply cushioned by the Assurance Package, while we will have the higher GST rate in place, and can start to collect additional tax from non-citizens and visitors."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01307,2023-11-07-T-016,1307,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I will now turn to transport-related issues, and I will start first with public transport and then I will cover some of the points raised regarding COE."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01308,2023-11-07-T-016,1308,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, on public transport, we had a session in October, during the Sitting, I think I answered a series of PQs, and I remember having supplementary questions from Mr Gerald Giam as well."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01309,2023-11-07-T-016,1309,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Mr Giam spoke about the profits earned by the public transport operators. I had mentioned this previously when we were discussing this issue, and I explained to Mr Giam and the House that we have to look at the different types of public transport service."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01310,2023-11-07-T-016,1310,Chee Hong Tat,"For buses, for example, the revenue that is being collected from commuters does not go to the operators. The revenue comes to the Government, and the Government then pays the operators. We pay them a rate that was agreed through the bus contracting tenders. And I also shared with Mr Giam and the House that over time, as we gain experience in doing bus contracting, we had been able to squeeze out more productivity improvements and reduce the payments and the rate of return for the bus operators."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01311,2023-11-07-T-016,1311,Chee Hong Tat,"For trains, the operators do collect fares to cover their operating costs, so the fares do affect their overall financials. And I shared, during October's Sitting, that in the latest financial year, after accounting for Government grants, SBS Transit reported a loss of several million dollars for their rail operations, while SMRT Trains reported an operating profit of $6 million dollars, which represents a profit margin of less than 1%."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01312,2023-11-07-T-016,1312,Chee Hong Tat,"So, just to be very clear, these are the kind of returns for the rail operations. And I also shared what we are doing, an ongoing process to try and improve the way we do bus contracting, to be able to squeeze out more savings for commuters and taxpayers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01313,2023-11-07-T-016,1313,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Mr Giam had a second point where he mentioned about whether we can nationalise our public transport system. Sir, I think, first, we take a look at where we are today."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01314,2023-11-07-T-016,1314,Chee Hong Tat,"Do we have a well-functioning public transport system overall? I think so. Public transport fares, if you look at the lower-income households in 2013, public transport expenditure was about 3.1% of their household income, it has fallen to 2.4% in 2022."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01315,2023-11-07-T-016,1315,Chee Hong Tat,"So, from accessibility, affordability and also network improvements, system improvements, I think over time, our current system has achieved good outcomes for commuters, and this is also reflected in the overall survey results and ratings that commuters have given us."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01316,2023-11-07-T-016,1316,Chee Hong Tat,"Of course, I am not saying that there are no areas for improvement; there are, and we will continue to look at what we can do to improve. But overall, compared to many other cities, I think, to be fair to our public transport operators and to our public transport workers, who have been working very hard to achieve this outcomes, they have, overall, done a good job."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01317,2023-11-07-T-016,1317,Chee Hong Tat,"So, what Mr Giam mentioned about nationalising, and I think he calls it the NTC, is actually not a silver bullet. I hope Mr Giam can agree with me that nationalising is not an assurance or guarantee that outcomes would be better. Yes, you can take away the profit element if you nationalise and turn it into a Government department, but just because a nationalised entity does not make profits, does not make money, does not necessarily mean commuters will get better outcomes. I think we have to be quite clear about that. What we want, at the end, is to have better outcomes for commuters, to have a better transport system for Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01318,2023-11-07-T-016,1318,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Giam also spoke about setting KPIs. Sir, we have seen from the experiences in other countries, how this approach sometimes may not work. I mean, if you look at history. The then-Soviet Union, under the previous central planning system, uses KPIs to try and track performance, and I think that I do not have the elaborate further. I think Mr Giam will agree with me that it is not a good outcome."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01319,2023-11-07-T-016,1319,Chee Hong Tat,"So, KPI is not a substitute for the profit motive that we need and the competition that we need, to spur the players to continuously improve. And we are adding additional pressure on them to improve their productivity. The new fare formula has a productivity component. We will exert pressure on them through this fare formula productivity component, to look at ways to continuously improve their productivity."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01320,2023-11-07-T-016,1320,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Mr Giam also mentioned about the coverage of service. I understand, and I think I did explain this to him previously, that when we do some of the changes with the bus services, some of the commuters will be affected, and I do recognise that – my residents, too, have been affected by such changes."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01321,2023-11-07-T-016,1321,Chee Hong Tat,"But the reason why we make these changes is because we have limited resources available to serve different needs, different groups of commuters. In different towns including, I am sure, Mr Giam's constituency, there will be new developments, new BTO flats, and the residents there will need new bus services to connect them to the bus interchange or to the MRT stations. So, where do we get the resources to serve these new demands? We have to look at how can we re-allocate some of the existing services."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01322,2023-11-07-T-016,1322,Chee Hong Tat,"It is not a simple exercise. We do not do it in a very drastic way because we do recognise the impact. We do it in a very calibrated manner, we look at which are the bus routes that run parallel to MRT lines, and where there is an option for people to take the bus, go to MRT station and then complete the longer part of their journey, the trunk service on the MRT. So, the bus then can provide better connectivity within the town as a feeder service."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01323,2023-11-07-T-016,1323,Chee Hong Tat,"But having said that, I have mentioned this to Mr Giam before and I still make the offer to him today, if there are some specific areas of concern faced by his residents, please do let me know, please do let LTA colleagues know. And we will discuss with you to see what we can do to improve the situation on the ground."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01324,2023-11-07-T-016,1324,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, allow me to now turn to COE. I want to start by saying that we just had a session on this yesterday. I answered a collection of PQs. I think we took quite some time. And I think Ms Hazel Poa and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim were both present in the Chamber. I do not know whether they heard my reply yesterday, because some of the points that they raised seem to have reflected that they heard me. But again, some of the points that they raised, they may have missed out or maybe they have forgotten what I have said. So, it is okay. Let me please have this chance to address some of the points that they raised."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01325,2023-11-07-T-016,1325,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I will start by actually thanking Assoc Prof Lim for acknowledging that — well, he raised many different ideas. They are all the different fancy ideas for improving the COE system, that in the end, actually only make a small difference, or in his words ""small dent"". And what he feels, if I had heard him correctly, is that the more effective way is to do the smoothening of the supply of the COE."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01326,2023-11-07-T-016,1326,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, that is exactly what I said yesterday in my reply. We are going to use the ""cut and fill"" method, not ""cut and paste"". ""Cut and paste"" is what you do on Microsoft Word. We are going to do the ""cut and fill"" method, where we ""cut"" the supply from the peak years, and then we fill the troughs, the short-term trough years."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01327,2023-11-07-T-016,1327,Chee Hong Tat,"So, by doing this, we are able to reduce the peak-to-trough ratio and achieve the outcome that I believe Assoc Prof Lim is also advocating for."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01328,2023-11-07-T-016,1328,Chee Hong Tat,"But I also, in response to Mr Saktiandi, gave a qualifier that we cannot overdo this, because you are effectively borrowing supply from the future. These cars that we are now borrowing the COEs from, are still on the roads. They have not yet been de-registered. So, if you overdo the ""cut and fill"", it means that in the short term, in the short run, you do have many more cars and it could lead to congestion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01329,2023-11-07-T-016,1329,Chee Hong Tat,"So, therefore, yes, we are looking at ways to do more ""cut and fill"" and we have announced increases in the quota for this coming quarter – 35% more than the last quarter for Cat A, 35% more for Cat B, 65% more for Cat C. We are doing that, but we also need to be mindful of the impact if we overdo it."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01330,2023-11-07-T-016,1330,Chee Hong Tat,"But I do thank Assoc Prof Lim for actually agreeing with us, that this is the most effective way to be able to deal with these concerns that we see in the COE market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01331,2023-11-07-T-016,1331,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Assoc Prof Lim also spoke about whether we could, if I heard him correctly, ban PHCs from COE bidding, and I think what he meant was then to have a separate category, because you cannot simply just ban them. I mean, there is genuine demand for these cars, so you cannot just ban them. I think what he meant was to have a separate category that they do not have to participate in the COE bidding with the Cat A and B. There is a separate category for PHCs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01332,2023-11-07-T-016,1332,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I explained this yesterday that, of course, conceptually it is not unthinkable to do something like this, but the trade-off is this  when you create a new category for PHCs, the supply for the COE does not magically appear. We still have to look for where to re-allocate the supply of COEs to put into this new category."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01333,2023-11-07-T-016,1333,Chee Hong Tat,"We are not talking about a magical solution, where I suddenly have new supply coming in. So, if we accept that point, Sir, then we are looking at a re-allocation from Cat A and B when we create this new category. And when we do that, as I explained yesterday, it is difficult to ascertain at what level of the supply should you shift into this new category, because the PHC market is still evolving and there are fluctuations from quarter to quarter, as we can see from the data."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01334,2023-11-07-T-016,1334,Chee Hong Tat,"If you allocate too much, you shift too much, it will actually affect the supply of COEs in Cat A and Cat B, and that will cause prices to spike even further. I think Assoc Prof Lim understands this point. But if you do not allocate enough, you do not shift enough, then there could be a problem for the PHCs, and which will, in turn, affect the drivers and commuters."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01335,2023-11-07-T-016,1335,Chee Hong Tat,"So, this is something that, I think, we have to be quite careful. But, Sir, I did mention in my reply yesterday that we are studying whether there are other ways to address this concern, maybe not through the COE system, but whether there are other ways, taking into account the reality that PHCs do travel more on the roads, a point that Assoc Prof Lim also mentioned. But they also serve a useful role in society, for commuters to meet their point-to-point journeys."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01336,2023-11-07-T-016,1336,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Assoc Prof Lim also mentioned about pay-as-you-bid. Sir, this is not going to give a different outcome from the current system. Let me explain."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01337,2023-11-07-T-016,1337,Chee Hong Tat,"Our current system is open bidding. This is not a closed bidding, where I do not know what people are bidding and I just go into the bid without knowing what other people are bidding. The COE system is online, you go in, you can see very clearly what other people are bidding, and you decide then how much you want to bid, based on your willingness to pay and you look at where that bid price is right now, and whether you are willing to pay more than that, to be able to secure the COE."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01338,2023-11-07-T-016,1338,Chee Hong Tat,"So, whether we do pay-as-you-bid, or we do the current system, I think that the outcome will be the same. The second point that Assoc Prof Lim mentioned is, can we use open market value (OMV) instead of other criteria to determine the COE bidding?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01339,2023-11-07-T-016,1339,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, we already have Cat A and Cat B to sort of proxy measure the kind of cars that people are buying. It is not a perfect correlation, of course, but many of the cars in Cat A do have a lower OMV compared to the cars in Cat B, so I think to some extent, this already achieves that purpose of being progressive."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01340,2023-11-07-T-016,1340,Chee Hong Tat,"But more importantly, Sir, we have the Additional Registration Fee (ARF). So, car ownership is progressive, the COE system has some elements of progressivity, but beyond that, if you look at the car ownership policy as a whole, the ARF is the other tool and perhaps the more effective and more direct way of having a progressive car ownership policy."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01341,2023-11-07-T-016,1341,Chee Hong Tat,"We, only very recently in Budget 2023, raised the ARF for luxury cars. And yesterday, I answered a question that after doing that, the number of luxury cars responding to the policy signals have actually come down."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01342,2023-11-07-T-016,1342,Chee Hong Tat,"I go back to my earlier point that Assoc Prof Lim mentioned as well, that he recognises that all these fanciful ideas are just going to have a small dent – in fact, I would say a very small dent – and this is not going to solve the fundamental issues. He agrees with us that the more fundamental approach, the better approach, is to look at how we can do more smoothening of the supply using the cut-and-fill method – which we are already doing."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01343,2023-11-07-T-016,1343,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, let me now turn to some of the points that Ms Hazel Poa raised. Unfortunately, she is not in the Chamber right now. Ms Poa asked whether we can have a 0.25% growth rate for Cat D. I think this is similar to the question that the Leader of the Opposition asked yesterday and Mr Murali Pillai also raised in November last year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01344,2023-11-07-T-016,1344,Chee Hong Tat,"As I had explained yesterday in the House, we have to look at the usage of motorcycles. It is similar to how PHCs are being used – because it can be dual use. People do use it for their personal use and also to do business, unlike, say, Cat C, where it is predominantly used for business needs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01345,2023-11-07-T-016,1345,Chee Hong Tat,"But I do acknowledge the concerns that Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Hazel Poa have raised – which is that the buyers of motorcycles tend to come from more lower-income households compared to car buyers. I had mentioned this in my reply yesterday. That is why we have lower ERP charges, we have lower ARF for motorcycles."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01346,2023-11-07-T-016,1346,Chee Hong Tat,"We will look at whether there are other ways to address this concern, to reflect the intent of what Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Hazel Poa would like to achieve. But I do not think we should go down the path of having a growth rate because they are quite different from Cat C in that regard."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01347,2023-11-07-T-016,1347,Chee Hong Tat,"Ms Poa also asked about the point-based system. By this, I think what she meant is whether we can do the allocation by giving certain weightage to certain categories of families and buyers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01348,2023-11-07-T-016,1348,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I understand where Ms Poa is coming from, but I think if you think about it in practice, if you are going to implement this idea, it is not so simple in practice. There are many Singapore families who would have a dependent, whether a young child or elderly parent. It would be very challenging to determine who is more deserving of a car. How would the person sitting at LTA be able to decide who is more deserving when all families would have different circumstances and needs?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01349,2023-11-07-T-016,1349,Chee Hong Tat,"Instead, our approach is to make mass public transport affordable, accessible and convenient, and also to complement this with shared point-to-point transport services, including taxis, private hire vehicles and car sharing and through this multi-pronged approach, be able to better meet the needs of our Singaporean families, who may not need to own a car all the time and use it all the time but they may need it during certain times of the week to bring the family out for an outing or to send their parents for medical appointments. If we can create more options for them to be able to use the car without necessarily having to own the car, I think that is one way in which we can help more families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01350,2023-11-07-T-016,1350,Chee Hong Tat,"For certain categories of families and individuals, for example, persons with disabilities who need a car for their livelihood, we do have a Government scheme called the Disabled Persons Scheme where we waive the ARF, we waive the COE. This is something which we do on a very targeted basis to help these individuals."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01351,2023-11-07-T-016,1351,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, on the point about foreigners or families who own multiple cars, I have addressed it yesterday, but since Ms Poa brought it up, allow me to explain this point again."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01352,2023-11-07-T-016,1352,Chee Hong Tat,"I shared yesterday that foreigners win about 1% of the bids for Cat A, 4% of the bids for Cat B. If you combine this with what I said earlier about the bidding system, they are not going to be the ones who are going to influence the bid price. Likewise, families who own multiple cars – they make up 5% of the total number of resident households."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01353,2023-11-07-T-016,1353,Chee Hong Tat,"So, again, the numbers are not so significant. We do not think that these two categories of buyers – foreigners and families that own multiple cars – will be the ones who actually end up driving the COE prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01354,2023-11-07-T-016,1354,Chee Hong Tat,"Because of that, introducing something like the ABSD may sound good, may make us feel ""shiok"" for short while, but it is not really going to solve the problem if our concern is about cost of living and high COE prices. It is not going to solve the problem. What Assoc Prof Lim mentioned earlier and what we are doing, the cut-and-fill, that is a more direct way of solving the problem."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01355,2023-11-07-T-016,1355,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I just want to end off on one final point on COE before I move on to my next topic, which is what Mr Leong Mun Wai mentioned. I think he may have misunderstood my data. Yesterday, I shared that the percentage of households that own cars has fallen gradually over time, from 40% to about one third now."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01356,2023-11-07-T-016,1356,Chee Hong Tat,"Maybe just allow me to clarify, Sir, that this trend has been happening not just in recent times when COE prices are high but even during the time when we have plentiful supply and COE prices were much lower. So, even then, we see the shift. It could be a generational shift. Maybe more people now may not feel that driving is necessary. Or like what I mentioned earlier, they may not need to own a car, they can just use the services of car from time to time when they need it. It could be that maybe they find that the public transport system has been improving over time and they would prefer to use public transport, which is also more sustainable for the environment."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01357,2023-11-07-T-016,1357,Chee Hong Tat,"Whichever the case may be, Sir, this trend has actually been consistent, whether COE prices are high or low. So, I thought I just clarify that point that Mr Leong mentioned."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01358,2023-11-07-T-016,1358,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, we have been able to keep our public services and finances sound through this combination of not delaying necessary adjustments while providing needed support to households."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01359,2023-11-07-T-016,1359,Chee Hong Tat,"Even in years when inflation is high, we still have to raise some charges and taxes because it is necessary to do so. It is not prudent or sustainable for the Government to avoid or subsidise every cost increase. Doing so will entail either a high burden on current and future generations of taxpayers or a deterioration of service standards."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01360,2023-11-07-T-016,1360,Chee Hong Tat,"It is not the responsible thing to keep kicking the can down the road or to avoid introducing painful but necessary increases. We may make some people happy by pursuing such policies but when the financing gap starts to accumulate over time, we will make everyone worse off because it will be even more painful to fix the problem later."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01361,2023-11-07-T-016,1361,Chee Hong Tat,"Importantly, the Government's policies should be seen together and not in isolation or piecemeal. The different policies and measures work together as a whole to collectively help ease the cost pressures on Singaporeans without undermining our fiscal sustainability. This is why I support the proposed amendment from Mr Liang Eng Hwa because he is right that the Government should continue pursuing policies that together lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01362,2023-11-07-T-016,1362,Chee Hong Tat,Our policies need to be sustainable because we care for Singaporeans now and also for our children and grandchildren.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01363,2023-11-07-T-016,1363,Chee Hong Tat,"I also applaud and encourage the community and kind-hearted sponsors to continue stepping forward with philanthropic donations to help support vulnerable groups in society. There are many ground-up initiatives, including from the NTUC and community groups, which provide local-level assistance to vulnerable residents, on top of Government subsidies. You heard from some of our MPs earlier."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01364,2023-11-07-T-016,1364,Chee Hong Tat,The CDC Mayors and many of our grassroots advisers do this regularly with community partners and donors. Community and corporations do their part alongside the Government in a whole-of-society effort to support the vulnerable.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01365,2023-11-07-T-016,1365,Chee Hong Tat,"This is our Singapore way – not just enabling ourselves and our family to do well, but also helping to support others in society so that we can progress together and leave no one behind."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01366,2023-11-07-T-016,1366,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, the reality is that global inflation will remain elevated for some time to come. We cannot fully insulate ourselves from these global forces. Prices of goods and services will rise to reflect higher costs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01367,2023-11-07-T-016,1367,Chee Hong Tat,"If we do what is politically convenient and prevent prices from rising, I am afraid we will create more problems. Giving more price subsidies will benefit certain groups at the expense of others. In particular, we end up helping the rich more than the poor. We will lose fiscal discipline and erode self-responsibility."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01368,2023-11-07-T-016,1368,Chee Hong Tat,"The fiscal deficit that gets created cannot be wished away and the burden will fall on future generations of Singaporeans. In the long run, it will hurt Singapore and Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01369,2023-11-07-T-016,1369,Chee Hong Tat,"Overall, the Government has moderated considerably the impact of inflation on Singaporeans, especially for lower- and middle-income segments, and we have done so on a sustainable basis, spending within our means and helping as many people as possible."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01370,2023-11-07-T-016,1370,Chee Hong Tat,"We will continue to monitor the need for more targeted support if inflation or economic outlook worsens. We will do so while maintaining discipline in ensuring that our interventions are fair, sustainable and effective."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01371,2023-11-07-T-016,1371,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, we welcome the Leader of the Opposition's call for a review to make sure that our policies are fit for purpose in a new era of higher prices. The Government has been reviewing our policies, including as part of Forward Singapore. Some changes have already been announced, for example, the Majulah Package for young seniors and the new housing model. Existing schemes such as Workfare are being enhanced and new initiatives such as re-employment support have been proposed."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01372,2023-11-07-T-016,1372,Chee Hong Tat,"We welcome further inputs into these policy reviews as we chart our way forward, but not all ideas will be feasible or will achieve our shared goals of a fairer and fiscally sustainable system."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01373,2023-11-07-T-016,1373,Chee Hong Tat,"To Members of this House and to all Singaporeans, I want to assure you that this Government will be responsive to the concerns of our people. We will continue to do our best to mitigate cost pressures for businesses and families. Importantly, we will do this in a way that is responsible and right for Singaporeans, today and tomorrow. [Applause.]"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01374,2023-11-07-T-016,1374,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01375,2023-11-07-T-016,1375,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Acting Minister for responding to my intervention on relooking water pricing tiers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01376,2023-11-07-T-016,1376,Pritam Singh,"As I heard him, when he spoke about broad-based subsidies, I was concerned that he may have misunderstood my proposal. As we know, the price of water has three components. That is how it is priced in Singapore. There is the tariff, waterborne fee and the conservation tax. I had not been talking about the tariff and the waterborne fee. I understand they have specific purposes. For example, the waterborne fee is a charge to offset the cost of treating used water and to maintain the public sewage system."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01377,2023-11-07-T-016,1377,Pritam Singh,"When I spoke of tiers for water conservation tax, I was not suggesting that, for example, a user at 35 cubic metres per month is going to be charged zero to 10 at one rate, then 10 to 20 – once you hit 35, if you pay the water conservation tax, that would be tiered for users who consume between 30 and 40 cubic metres of water. That progressivity, in my view, would serve the purpose of the water conservation tax, which is to reinforce the water conservation message. That was the suggestion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01378,2023-11-07-T-016,1378,Pritam Singh,The Acting Minister was talking about broad-based subsidies and the rich also getting subsidised. That was not the focus of what I was driving at. I hope I made myself clear. I will be happy to clarify if the Acting Minister has his queries on this.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01379,2023-11-07-T-016,1379,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his clarification. I understand where he is coming from. I think we are all on the same page when we want to look at how we mitigate the impact on lower-income families. We share the same objective."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01380,2023-11-07-T-016,1380,Chee Hong Tat,"The way that we are doing it now, all three components – the tariff, the water conservation tax and the water-borne fee – all three components actually add together to reflect the true cost of producing water, the next drop of water. And because of that, we feel that it is better to let this true cost be reflected from the first drop. But then, we help the lower-income with means-tested U-Save rebates."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01381,2023-11-07-T-016,1381,Chee Hong Tat,"So, I think our objectives are similar. But it is just the way in which we achieve it, we may differ somewhat. But I think, with Mr Pritam Singh's clarification, the gap has narrowed."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01382,2023-11-07-T-016,1382,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01383,2023-11-07-T-016,1383,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, I thank Senior Minister of State for responding to my proposals."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01384,2023-11-07-T-016,1384,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I wish to, first, make a correction to one of the figures I cited in my speech earlier. I said between 2011 and 2022, SMRT and SBS Transit together posted profits averaging $55 million a year and reaching $110 million in the last financial year. The $55 million figure is incorrect. For that date range, it should actually be $74.6 million. So, the sentence, should read, ""Between 2011 and 2022, SMRT and SBS Transit have together posted profits averaging $74.6 million a year, reaching $110 million in the last financial year."" These numbers are from two companies' financial statements."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01385,2023-11-07-T-016,1385,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, just some clarifications on Senior Minister of State's response just now."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01386,2023-11-07-T-016,1386,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I am surprised that the Senior Minister of State is saying that setting KPIs does not work and he cited the Soviets. Surely, he is aware that setting individual and team KPIs is an established practice in many organisations. Even the Ministerial salary framework includes KPIs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01387,2023-11-07-T-016,1387,Gerald Giam Yean Song,But my point was that tying an executive's salary to their achievement of performance targets is a better motivator of that executive's performance than a company's profitability. It is also more aligned with commuters' interests.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01388,2023-11-07-T-016,1388,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Next, the Senior Minister of State said that with our NTC, there is no guarantee that it will get better outcomes. But what we are seeing now is a public transport model that is sucking up Government subsidies while still posting million-dollar profits which benefit shareholders, not the commuters. Can the Senior Minister of State then assure us that the current model is fiscally sustainable and will produce better outcomes in the long run?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01389,2023-11-07-T-016,1389,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Finally, just one last point. I was not criticising the public transport workers in any way. In fact, I think they are doing a fantastic job in terms of keeping our public transport system working. What I was talking about was the public transport model, not the workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01390,2023-11-07-T-016,1390,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, first, let me thank Mr Gerald Giam for his clarification and showing appreciation to our workers; 4 November is Public Transport Workers' Appreciation Day. So, thank you to Mr Gerald Giam for acknowledging their hard work."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01391,2023-11-07-T-016,1391,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the profit numbers that Mr Gerald Giam cited represent the profit numbers for the group as a whole. So, if we look at SBST, for example, they have both local and overseas operations. Locally, they have bus, they have MRT. They also have taxis. They also have other operations. I am sorry, SMRT. I was referring to SMRT, not SBST. SBST does not have taxis. SBST has MRT, bus and also overseas operations."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01392,2023-11-07-T-016,1392,Chee Hong Tat,"So, if we take a look at the total package of the scope of what they do overall, I think those numbers would have to be looked at more specifically when it concerns the component that has to do with fares, because we are talking about fares here. Right? So, there is no point we have an argument about how much money they make with their advertising or their overseas investments. Those are separate. It is part of the numbers that you see as a group. But for the purposes of our debate here, we should be looking at the numbers that are linked to fares."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01393,2023-11-07-T-016,1393,Chee Hong Tat,"And as I explained earlier, Sir, for buses, yes, the profit numbers today that you see reflect some of the older contracts that we did previously. But if we look at the newer contracts, we have, with experience, actually tightened the terms and conditions. And there is now also more competition. We now have four bus operators. So, as a process, achieving savings for commuters and for taxpayers, that will take time to achieve, but we are making steps in the right direction. We are seeing a reduction in the returns for the newer contracts."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01394,2023-11-07-T-016,1394,Chee Hong Tat,"For MRT, I need to highlight that what we are talking about here again —"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01395,2023-11-07-T-016,1395,Chee Hong Tat,"I am sorry, Sir, just to reiterate one more point on the bus is that the fares do not go to the bus operators directly. I mentioned this a few times. The fares come to LTA. LTA then pays the operators. So, if we collect less than what we have to pay them, that is actually Government subsidy."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01396,2023-11-07-T-016,1396,Chee Hong Tat,"The trains, I mentioned that the train operators do collect the fares and that is part of their revenue. But if we look at the train operations for both SBST and SMRT trains, the numbers, as I shared earlier, SBST making losses of several millions; SMRT trains making a profit of 1% return, $6 million."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01397,2023-11-07-T-016,1397,Chee Hong Tat,"So, I think we have to look at it in the right perspective rather than look at the macro numbers, which may not be relevant to the discussion that we are currently having with public transport fares."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01398,2023-11-07-T-016,1398,Chee Hong Tat,"On the second point about KPIs, Sir, I did not say that KPIs are not relevant at all. I did not say that. What I said was that KPIs should not be a substitute, because if you only rely on KPIs and nothing else, then you will have a problem. But I do not think that is what Mr Gerald Giam is saying as well. So, we may not differ that much. I think we can both agree that KPIs can form part of the overall performance management tracking, but they should not be the only way of improving performance."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01399,2023-11-07-T-016,1399,Chee Hong Tat,"And in the case of the public transport operations, if we look at buses, for example, one of the reasons why we are able to have better outcomes, partly, I want to give credit to our LTA colleagues. It is because, over time, we do learn how to do the contracting better. But it is also because there is more competition."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01400,2023-11-07-T-016,1400,Chee Hong Tat,"So, if you nationalise, you take away this competition element, you may not actually achieve the same outcomes as what you are able to achieve now. It is an assumption that nationalising, taking away the profit element, means better outcomes for commuters. Need not be."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01401,2023-11-07-T-016,1401,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01402,2023-11-07-T-016,1402,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Speaker, two clarifications from me."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01403,2023-11-07-T-016,1403,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The first has to do what Senior Minister of State Chee mentioned. He said he wondered if I heard him yesterday. Indeed, I did. And that is why I referred to the cut-and-fill method. But I also wonder if he heard me just now when I also pointed out that the Government action in the cut-and-fill method did not strike me as decisive enough. And by my calculations, it would not move the needle."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01404,2023-11-07-T-016,1404,Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, if the difference is one of degree, I wonder if the Government will commit to an eventual target of a more or less equal vehicle quota for every year sometime into the future. And if they are willing to do so, how will they actually avoid the existing incentives for individuals to sell COEs in shortage years and to buy them in abundant years. That is my first question."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01405,2023-11-07-T-016,1405,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The second one has to do with what the Senior Minister of State mentioned about PHC participation in Cat E. Just to be clear, my suggestion was that PHCs should – it is not that they should not be allowed to bid, but they should be treated the same as taxis rather than being banned altogether. So, on that, I wonder if Senior Minister of State Chee will agree that the common treatment of PHCs as well as taxi cabs makes much more sense than the current approach."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01406,2023-11-07-T-016,1406,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I did explain earlier in my response that, to do cut-and-fill, we have to also be mindful of the trade-offs because we are effectively borrowing from the future."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01407,2023-11-07-T-016,1407,Chee Hong Tat,"So, I did hear the suggestion from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. Same concept but the Member wants us to do more. And I clarified that it is not that we do not want to do more but there are trade-offs and we need to be careful because, if you borrow too much, you actually may introduce more volatility. Please do not forget that the cars that are being deregistered in future, some of them may want to buy another car. And we are also borrowing from the future. So, you are effectively shifting some of the supply to now before the cars are deregistered. So, you are adding to the short-term congestion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01408,2023-11-07-T-016,1408,Chee Hong Tat,"So, yes, we accept those trade-offs and we are willing to do some, but to what extent? There is a balance."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01409,2023-11-07-T-016,1409,Chee Hong Tat,But the more important point is that we do not disagree on the method. We both agree that cut-and-fill to reduce the peak and trough is the more effective way.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01410,2023-11-07-T-016,1410,Chee Hong Tat,"If I may add, Sir, on PHCs, because that is the second question from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. The injection that we have done, 35% increase for Cat A, 35% increase for Cat B, compared to third quarter, which is injected some already. So, this is in addition to that, we are injecting 35%, compared to third quarter. That number is actually more than for the previous few quarters the percentage of car-leasing companies that were bidding."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01411,2023-11-07-T-016,1411,Chee Hong Tat,"So, if you look at the companies that are bidding PHCs, I shared yesterday that, for Cat A, it is about 21% or thereabouts, it dropped to 16% in the last quarter. Cat B, I shared also that it is about 23% or thereabouts."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01412,2023-11-07-T-016,1412,Chee Hong Tat,"So, what we have injected, 35% for Cat A and Cat B, it is actually more than the bidding, the bids that were won by the car-leasing companies for the past few quarters."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01413,2023-11-07-T-016,1413,Chee Hong Tat,"Of course, I did qualify that I cannot predict how prices will move because that depends on demand, and demand is not within the Government's control. But in terms of planning and injecting, we are doing our best to try and inject as much as we can without affecting the future supply volatility and without affecting short-term congestion on the roads."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01414,2023-11-07-T-016,1414,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think the point about having a separate category, I also explained this yesterday and also earlier. Allow me to just quickly recap."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01415,2023-11-07-T-016,1415,Chee Hong Tat,"It is not that it is undoable. But whether you treat it like taxis or you put it as a separate category, that means, different from taxis, the reality is that you still need supply to come from somewhere, right? You cannot just suddenly have new supply magically appear. It has to come from somewhere. And where would that be? It will be Cat A and Cat B."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01416,2023-11-07-T-016,1416,Chee Hong Tat,"So, if you create a new category, whether you put it together with taxis or you put it separately, you have to move some of the existing supply from Cat A and Cat B to this new category."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01417,2023-11-07-T-016,1417,Chee Hong Tat,It is not that it is undoable or unthinkable but it introduces complexities because we run the risk of either over re-allocating or under re-allocating and that would have unintended consequences.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01418,2023-11-07-T-016,1418,Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01419,2023-11-07-T-016,1419,Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Speaker. I have one clarification for the Acting Minister. Does he not agree that when we talk about utilities in the current climate, conservation is a key aspect of it. I think the Government has recognised this. We have seen recent statements about the need to conserve energy and water."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01420,2023-11-07-T-016,1420,Sylvia Lim,"In this respect, U-Save vouchers, no doubt they are appreciated by the residents who receive them, but it actually does not really encourage conservation of the utilities. So, I am just wondering whether the Acting Minister would agree that we may have to keep an open mind as to whether we need further tools to encourage residents to conserve on the use of utilities."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01421,2023-11-07-T-016,1421,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I am not sure why Ms Sylvia Lim felt that U-Save rebates are not encouraging people to conserve electricity and water. If we look at it from the recipient's point of view, this is a fixed amount, means-tested. But what they receive is a fixed amount. If they consume a lot, actually, the amount of subsidies they receive is still the same. If they consume less, then actually, the amount of subsidies can help them to sometimes even fully offset the electricity bill or to reduce it substantially."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01422,2023-11-07-T-016,1422,Chee Hong Tat,"So, the incentive to want to save is still there because it is a fixed amount. It is not embedded in the price, unlike a price subsidy, whereby if I consume more, actually, I do end up getting a higher quantum of subsidies because it is embedded in the price. In our case, we reflect fully the price so as we incentivise the right behaviour to conserve electricity and water, a point that we both agree. That is important. But the way in which we then provide the help is through the U-Save rebates. It does not distort the behaviour. It does not change the incentive to want to conserve, but it provides the help in a means-tested manner to our lower- and middle-income families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01423,2023-11-07-T-016,1423,Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01424,2023-11-07-T-016,1424,Hazel Poa,I would like to seek two clarifications from the Senior Minister of State.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01425,2023-11-07-T-016,1425,Hazel Poa,"First, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that the bus fare goes to LTA, not to the bus operators. Can I clarify then who proposes the revision in bus fares? Is it LTA?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01426,2023-11-07-T-016,1426,Hazel Poa,"Second, I thank the Senior Minister of State for responding to my suggestions about the points-based system. He mentioned that it would be difficult because there are many families with children and, therefore, a bit difficult to decide. Would he consider a system whereby, say, the bidding price is given a certain number of points, say, every $1,000 is one point, and then every child that the family has is allocated a certain number of points, so that those with more children get more points and those families with people with disabilities (PwDs) also get additional points? And then COEs are allocated based on the total number of points. Would he consider a system like that?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01427,2023-11-07-T-016,1427,Hazel Poa,"The Senior Minister of State mentioned the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS), which I understand is only for livelihood purposes, not for families with disabled people, and for them to move around."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01428,2023-11-07-T-016,1428,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, the public transport fares are set by the Public Transport Council. In October, I shared the fare formula and that was also previously announced, and the different components that made up this fare formula. So, it is a very transparent process. There are some indicators that we look at – what is the national benchmark for wage increases, what is the CPI, what is the energy cost. And, of course, as I mentioned earlier, there is that productivity component to incentivise the operators to want to improve productivity over time."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01429,2023-11-07-T-016,1429,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the second point that Ms Poa raised, I think it goes back to the earlier reply that I gave. You cannot run away from some judgement call if you go down a points system because who would be more deserving? It is really going to be very, very difficult to differentiate. If you use the number of children, for example, I have four children, but I think Ms Poa will agree I should not get additional subsidies or priority just because I have four children. So, there are many, many situations that you look at; it is very difficult to then say how many children as the only yardstick or as the only criterion. So, the way that we think about it is this  how do we help the families through different avenues – not just COE alone, because COE is really more for allocation of a scarce resource – but how do we help different families who may need the car not all the time, but at certain times of the day or certain times of the week."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01430,2023-11-07-T-016,1430,Chee Hong Tat,"So, one way is to use point-to-point service, and we are doing a review on that; a point-to-point review. I mentioned this yesterday as well. How do we enhance the services for commuters to meet evolving commuter needs? And it will include families that Ms Poa and others have highlighted, where there is a genuine need for point-to-point service and instead of just relying on car ownership alone. Some of them can own a car but some of them may not be able to own a car. Can we help them in other ways? Point-to-point service, car sharing, and I think it takes a whole-of-society approach, not just the Government because for many of these families that need help, sometimes they also receive some help from the community and from voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs). So, it is a whole-of-society effort; that we do our best to support these families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01431,2023-11-07-T-016,1431,Speaker,"Ms Lim, do you have a further clarification? Okay, Mr Leong Mun Wai."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01432,2023-11-07-T-016,1432,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, I think we have gone through a lot; we covered a lot of ground. But as I hear the debate go on, I just felt that probably it is about balance. Policymaking is about balance. So, I would like to ask the Acting Minister two questions with regard to that."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01433,2023-11-07-T-016,1433,Leong Mun Wai,"I think the way the Government conducts policies today, a lot is profit-seeking and using the market model. So, I think, as the alternative parties, what we are bringing to the House is that we hear a lot of feedback about problems. So, the angle must be, besides using the market model completely, there must be more consideration for the social aspects of a lot of the policies. So, let me ask the Acting Minister two questions in relation to that."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01434,2023-11-07-T-016,1434,Leong Mun Wai,"One is, for example, the water price. We know from the statistics provided by the Government that most of the increase in the water demand comes from the big users – the water-intensive industries and all that. So, maybe the Government wants to make ourselves more competitive —"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01435,2023-11-07-T-016,1435,Speaker,"Mr Leong, you should just ask your clarification and not make another speech."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01436,2023-11-07-T-016,1436,Leong Mun Wai,"— make ourselves more competitive. So, we want to know whether if we alter the way the water is priced, the Leader of Opposition talked about having another category under 40 cubic metres. Is it possible to have another category, between 40 cubic metres and 80 cubic metres, so that we differentiate and we push the cost more to the big users? Because right now, you look at the water prices we are doing and whenever we need to increase our water supply, we need investments. And so, as a result, the burden of the investments comes back to the average Singaporeans. Do you agree with that? That is one point."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01437,2023-11-07-T-016,1437,Leong Mun Wai,"Second point about the COE, it is the same thing. Cars are a scarce resource. So, we have to allocate that. But if we use the market system, the Singaporeans will be squeezed out of the market very soon, the average Singaporean. So, as a result, do you agree that we ought to see how we allocate this scarce supply of cars, not just by the market price but by the Government coming in? Maybe one of the solutions, do you agree, is to adjust the allocation to, like what I said in my speech, those that go to Cat B, shrink it; increase the supply for Cat A and C drastically."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01438,2023-11-07-T-016,1438,Leong Mun Wai,"Currently, I think it is about 50/50, right? Maybe 70/30? Will that solve the problem? ""Solve the problem"" meaning, will that allow average Singaporeans a better chance of having a car, even going into the future?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01439,2023-11-07-T-016,1439,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Chee.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01440,2023-11-07-T-016,1440,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I first need to say that I reject the way that Mr Leong has characterised the way the Government operates. I think that is quite uncalled for. I just spent a good 40 to 45 minutes explaining our approach to helping Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living and what we are doing through different ways in a fair, effective and sustainable manner. We can debate about different ideas. We can discuss different possibilities, like what the Leader of Opposition and I have done just now on water. That is okay, Sir. But I reject what Mr Leong has said, that the Government is profit-seeking."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01441,2023-11-07-T-016,1441,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, if we look at public transport, just now Mr Giam mentioned, if we are indeed profit-seeking, the way to do it is to pass through all 22.6%, as recommended by the formula. Did we do that? No, we did not. We passed through less than one third and we absorbed the rest, because we understand that in this current environment, we do not want to add further stresses on Singaporean families. And this cost the Government $300 million to plug the delta, the 15.6%. And on top of that, every year we give $2 billion for public transport, $1 billion thereabouts for bus, $1 billion for MRT. Again, this is profit-seeking?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01442,2023-11-07-T-016,1442,Chee Hong Tat,"So, Sir, I respectfully ask Mr Leong to withdraw that comment as I think it is not fair and it is not the right way to describe the way the Government operates or to conduct this debate. Can I pause here to ask if the Member agrees to withdraw that comment first before I answer the rest of his questions."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01443,2023-11-07-T-016,1443,Speaker,Mr Leong.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01444,2023-11-07-T-016,1444,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think one of the basic approaches adopted by the Government is still to make sure that public services are profitable. I will stand by that. So, if they want to ensure that the public services are profitable, then it is profit-seeking."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01445,2023-11-07-T-016,1445,Leong Mun Wai,"So, if there are certain industries like the bus services that you cannot make a profit yet, then it might be because that you are still trying out the model. Because this contracting is a new model, when compared to other things. But whereas in the established areas, like water and COE, you definitely have —"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01446,2023-11-07-T-016,1446,Speaker,"Mr Leong, actually all Senior Minister of State Chee is asking is  are you withdrawing? If you are not, then the short answer is no."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01447,2023-11-07-T-016,1447,Leong Mun Wai,"No, I am not withdrawing."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01448,2023-11-07-T-016,1448,Speaker,"Yes, thank you."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01449,2023-11-07-T-016,1449,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, since Mr Leong has refused to withdraw, I would have to put on record that we reject the way he has characterised the way the Government operates and then I can give many more examples. But in the interest of time, maybe just allow me to comment on one thing."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01450,2023-11-07-T-016,1450,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the bus contracting model that Mr Leong mentioned, I do not know if Mr Leong is aware that, at the moment, for bus services, LTA, as I mentioned earlier, provides $1 billion every year because it is loss-making. Almost all the bus services that are running on our roads today are not making profit. They are all losing money."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01451,2023-11-07-T-016,1451,Chee Hong Tat,"Why do we continue to run them? Because they meet the needs of our residents. Because they meet the connectivity, commuting needs of Singaporeans. So, even when the bus service is not making money, we know this is a public good. This is a public service. It is an essential service. We continue to run that service even though it is not making money. And then to make sure that we are able to run this on a sustained basis, the Government then provides the subsidies to the tune of $1 billion for bus and $1 billion for MRT. So, Sir, we are looking for financially and fiscally sustainable outcomes. It is different from profit-seeking."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01452,2023-11-07-T-016,1452,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the social aspect in policy formulation, I think it is very much top-of-mind for the Government. If you listen to different generations of Finance Ministers during Budget, there will always be one segment on the economy because we do need to grow the economy to earn a living, to create jobs. But there is always an important segment also on social policies. National Day Rally – the Prime Minister has always focused as well on different ways of improving our social policies – housing, education, healthcare."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01453,2023-11-07-T-016,1453,Chee Hong Tat,"So, again, Sir, I reject the way that Mr Leong has characterised the Government's way of working to say that we only care about profits and there is no social aspect in our policymaking. It is absolutely untrue."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01454,2023-11-07-T-016,1454,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I now turn to the point that Mr Leong mentioned about water, and I am not sure whether I heard him correctly. He said that we should have a different category from 40 cubic metres to 80 cubic metres. Sir, I explained earlier, and I think Mr Singh also mentioned in his speech, that, today, 96% of households consume below 40 cubic metres. So, I am a bit puzzled why Mr Leong is proposing that we should have a different category between 40 cubic metres to 80 cubic metres, catering to some of this 4% and then to provide subsidies for them."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01455,2023-11-07-T-016,1455,Chee Hong Tat,"I find it quite strange why he is proposing something like this. I thought the right thing to do, Sir, is to price the water correctly from the first drop, starting from the first drop. But we understand that there are different families with different needs, different financial circumstances and we want to then provide more help and support to the lower- and middle-income families. And the way to do this, the most effective way, in our view, is to then provide means-tested U-Save rebates that are fixed in a the quantity, so that if you consume more, actually beyond that, you pay. So, there is a strong element, strong incentive to encourage people to save water. I think that is the better way to do it and not to create a new category between 40 cubic metres to 80 cubic metres."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01456,2023-11-07-T-016,1456,Speaker,Mr Leong.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01457,2023-11-07-T-016,1457,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Prime Minister does not think that this is developing into a brawl. But we are just trying to clarify further. So, can I reply to the Acting Minister through you, that one, I did not say that the Government did not consider social factors at all. What I am saying is that, when we are debating here, maybe we are trying to push and say that, let us consider the social factors a bit more? So, as a result, I think the Acting Minister has also misunderstood me."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01458,2023-11-07-T-016,1458,Leong Mun Wai,"What I mean to say is that for water, for example, the water demand is increasing very fast but it is because of the big user. So, recently, when we announced the 18% increase in water price, if we have another category for the bigger user, then maybe the lowest 40 cubic metres do not need to have price increases. Push the price increase to the next category. So, is that possible or not?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01459,2023-11-07-T-016,1459,Leong Mun Wai,"Of course, it will affect the competitiveness of the water-intensive businesses in Singapore but it is unfair for Singaporeans, right? When the big users are the ones who are increasing the demand and we have to put a lot of investment into water supply and then the costs are borne by the smaller user because of the price increase."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01460,2023-11-07-T-016,1460,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I think first, we have to get our facts correct. The demand for water in Singapore is predominantly actually from households. The majority is actually not from businesses."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01461,2023-11-07-T-016,1461,Chee Hong Tat,"So, when we look at businesses, we charge them the full price of water from the first drop and we do not give them any U-Save rebates unlike households. So, that is the difference. Contrary to what Mr Leong seems to have understood, it is actually the other way round. We charge everyone the full price of water from the first drop and then we give means-tested subsidies through U-Save rebates to households, lower-income households getting more but for businesses, they do not get any U-Save rebates. What we do with them is to help them to improve their energy and water efficiency."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01462,2023-11-07-T-016,1462,Speaker,"Mr Leong, if it is a clarification, I will allow it. Is it a further clarification? ["
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01463,2023-11-07-T-016,1463,Hazel Poa,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I like to seek a clarification from Senior Minister of State when he said that the bus services are making losses, can I clarify whether that takes into account advertising revenue from advertising on the bus surface, the panels behind the bus, in the bus, panels at the bus stop, at the bus interchanges, rent from kiosks at the bus stops, at the bus interchanges and so on?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01464,2023-11-07-T-016,1464,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the buses are running because they provide an essential service, they are not making money and we are providing subsidies to the tune of $1 billion every year. I do not know which advertising firm Ms Poa has in mind but if you think you can make $1 billion dollars in advertising revenue, please let me know."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01465,2023-11-07-T-016,1465,Speaker,"Mr Leong, if it is a clarification, yes."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01466,2023-11-07-T-016,1466,Leong Mun Wai,"One more clarification for the Senior Minister of State. As far as I know from the statistics, currently the big users account for 55% of the demand, right? The households 45%, right? Is that statistic correct?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01467,2023-11-07-T-016,1467,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I am sorry if I mis-spoke and I got my facts wrong. I need to go back and double check this. But if the data is the other way round, I apologise for the factual error. But it does not change the point I was making and I hope Mr Leong can agree with me on that, that we charge businesses and households the true cost of water from the first drop and we do not provide U-Save rebates to the businesses. That part I can confirm and double confirm."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01468,2023-11-07-T-016,1468,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01469,2023-11-07-T-016,1469,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the amendments proposed by Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa, as they reflect the existing global drivers and efforts so far as well as trade-offs. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01470,2023-11-07-T-016,1470,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I am concerned about the rising cost of living that our people are experiencing. Therefore, the issue of cost of living has been a core priority in this House this year, and I, as well as other Members, have previously raised it, together with the impact of high interest rates."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01471,2023-11-07-T-016,1471,Saktiandi Supaat,"It is evidently front-and-centre in the Government's policy making efforts with the announcement of the $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package last month, building on the Assurance Package, and other measures announced at Budget 2023. Singaporeans will be receiving at least $400 in cash and CDC vouchers, with lower income Singaporeans receiving up to $800 cash in December 2023. There will also be rebates to manage Service & Conservancy Charges (S&CC) and U-Save rebates."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01472,2023-11-07-T-016,1472,Saktiandi Supaat,"Some of the inflationary pressures that Singaporeans are facing are also happening worldwide, due to the Russia-Ukraine war and bad harvests related to climate change, for example, driving up energy and food prices. Not to mention the risks of supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates in a longer environment and the possibility of an escalation of the situation in the Middle East."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01473,2023-11-07-T-016,1473,Saktiandi Supaat,"Aside from specific government support through fiscal assistance, which have been very helpful to our people, many Singaporeans may not know that our government and financial agencies actually play a big part in shielding their wallets from some of these economic spillovers. The effectiveness of a strong SGD currency policy, for instance, as result of MAS tightening monetary policy five times in a row, including in two off-cycle moves last year, has enabled MAS to contain imported cost pressures, and some economists such as OCBC’s chief economist is of the view that this will be sustained for several quarters ahead.  While inflation is still elevated, MAS' five successive monetary policy tightening moves since October 2021 have tempered the momentum of price increases. The effects of MAS' monetary policy tightening are still working through the economy and should dampen inflation even further."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01474,2023-11-07-T-016,1474,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am also concerned and have asked many questions alongside other Members in the House about the increase in transport costs including high COE for motorcycles and cars. The Government recognises that some Singaporeans and the Malay-Muslim community rely on motorcycles for their livelihood, and there is a higher proportion of lower-income individuals among motorcycle owners than car owners. This is one of the reasons why the ARS Additional Registration Charges, road tax and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) for motorcycles are lower than other types of vehicles. To protect against speculative bidding behaviour for Category D COEs, MOT introduced several measures in the last two years. These are very much welcomed. It includes raising the bid deposit for Category D Temporary COEs, or TCOEs, to $1,500; and reducing the validity period of COEs to one month."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01475,2023-11-07-T-016,1475,Saktiandi Supaat,"The price of Category D COEs has dropped from over $13,000 in November 2022 and remains at around $11,000 in the recent bidding exercise. The Government has said it will continue to study ways to improve the COE system for Category D, including new ideas. Hence, I am waiting whether they will look at ways to improve this system."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01476,2023-11-07-T-016,1476,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In English)  Sir, some of the inflationary pressures that Singaporeans are facing are worldwide – I mentioned this in my Malay segment – due to the Russia-Ukraine war and bad harvests related to climate change, for example, driving up energy and food prices. I think many are not aware – I mentioned in my Malay segment about how MAS policy has helped to mitigate imported inflation."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01477,2023-11-07-T-016,1477,Saktiandi Supaat,"According to a study by NUS, Singapore’s food prices are also much less volatile than global food prices. This in part is due again to our exchange rate policy accordingly and is helping us in terms of purchasing power in the world market, thereby, providing a greater buffer towards global food price shocks."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01478,2023-11-07-T-016,1478,Saktiandi Supaat,"As cited by the NUS study, our various policies such as increased local production, diversification of food sources and stockpiling are all working to help insulate Singaporeans from externally driven cost of living pressures, albeit the cost of living pressures continued to be there because of global factors."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01479,2023-11-07-T-016,1479,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, the Government has also rolled out a suite of policies to keep day-to-day costs down, such as HDB’s requirement for all coffee shops leased from HDB to offer budget meal options to diners by 2026. The issuance of CDC Vouchers to households is of special mention – I mentioned it in my Malay segment as well – these are complemented at the local level by individual constituencies’ grassroots efforts. I think Acting Minister Chee highlighted that in his speech as well as other Members as well."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01480,2023-11-07-T-016,1480,Saktiandi Supaat,"I just want to share the experience at Toa Payoh East, at the local level, for example, I launched the Cost of Living Assistance Programme, called CLAP, sometime in the third quarter of 2022, a ground-up initiative working together with hawkers and donors and grassroots to assist lower- to lower-middle income households – we wanted to capture the lower-middle income households – in Toa Payoh East with their daily expenses."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01481,2023-11-07-T-016,1481,Saktiandi Supaat,"Ground-up initiatives with the merchants and grassroots supported initiatives to assist residents who are affected by high cost of living especially groceries and essentials. I just want to highlight, it is a tripartite involvement – merchants, residents and Toa Payoh East Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCC) – to help residents as much as possible and also to make sure that the hawkers actually do have business. This initiative also hopes to bring back some business opportunities to the heartland shops and convenience for residents. So, they get about $100 worth of CLAP vouchers, which can be used to offset their purchase for meals and essentials items at the participating hawkers and heartland merchants."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01482,2023-11-07-T-016,1482,Saktiandi Supaat,"The aim is to target low- to middle- income residents, as I mentioned. I think we expect to help up to about 500 families from last September in 2022 when we first launched up to end of this year. So far, we have given out close to about 200 and has benefited merchants and hawkers at Lorong 7 and Lorong 8 Toa Payoh."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01483,2023-11-07-T-016,1483,Saktiandi Supaat,"The purpose I am sharing this is to highlight that there are discretionary measures that advisers and MPs can do on top of the ComCare and welfare assistance that are available that the Government has provided to alleviate cost pressures which includes CDC Vouchers, GST rebates and transport vouchers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01484,2023-11-07-T-016,1484,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am wanting to highlight that the CDC Vouchers are not means-tested. It is the Government spending about $600 million, I think, if I am not mistaken – up to about $600 million so far and is not means-tested."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01485,2023-11-07-T-016,1485,Saktiandi Supaat,"So, on top of that, we have these discretionary measures that, I think, all the advisers and MPs can undertake in their respective constituencies."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01486,2023-11-07-T-016,1486,Saktiandi Supaat,
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01487,2023-11-07-T-016,1487,Saktiandi Supaat,"Against this global backdrop, Mr Speaker, the Government is also implementing tough decisions for longer-term economic policies and fiscal measures. Acting Minister Chee has highlighted extensively the impact of the increases in the GST and how they matter for Singapore – carbon tax and water prices, COE quotas, for example, with specific objectives. The main thing is it helps to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability and reduces burdening future generations of Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01488,2023-11-07-T-016,1488,Saktiandi Supaat,"These are necessary to achieve other policy objectives beyond just keeping inflationary pressures for Singaporeans' day-to-day lives in check. It is essential that Singapore continues to address our medium- to long-term challenges head on even as we face inflationary challenges now. That is the Singaporean way, and I think Acting Minister Chee mentioned it, that has ensured Singapore’s survival, gelling a very long-term strategic perspective even as we face short-term challenges but with the welfare of Singaporeans taken care of and negative impact mitigated, especially for the more vulnerable groups."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01489,2023-11-07-T-016,1489,Saktiandi Supaat,"These policies will invariably lead to price increases in the short term, but ensure fiscal sustainability and environmental sustainability measures are needed now and I think we need to address them now before things get worse in the medium to long term."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01490,2023-11-07-T-016,1490,Saktiandi Supaat,"Sir, the current approach to ensure affordability for Singaporeans amid these price increases is more prudent as they also minimise the cost pressures on Singaporeans who are most feeling the pinch in terms of cost of living through measures, such as providing targeted assistance to lower-income groups, providing offsets and subsidies to help ease the burden on households and staggering the implementation of policy initiatives as well as increasing wages progressively for low-wage workers. All these are already mentioned by Members as well as Acting Minister Chee earlier."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01491,2023-11-07-T-016,1491,Saktiandi Supaat,"One example I just want to highlight again, as what the Acting Minister has mentioned, is the recent announcement by the Public Transport Council to allow a 7% fare increase in 2023. This is one example reiterating again what the Acting Minister mentioned, one instance where the Government has calibrated the impact of cost of living pressures."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01492,2023-11-07-T-016,1492,Saktiandi Supaat,The Acting Minister for Transport has also explained the recent decisions and the Government's core consideration that fares remain affordable while the public transport system remains financially sustainable. That is quite important and he has shared this with the House last month as well.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01493,2023-11-07-T-016,1493,Saktiandi Supaat,"I will not belabour these points. But what is key are actually the 10% reduction in the cost of monthly concession passes, implementation of a new discounted monthly pass for Workfare Transport Concession cardholders and the $50 Public Transport Vouchers for lower-income households. These further measures accompanying the fare increases demonstrate the Government's approach to targeted help in ameliorating cost of living pressures for the lower-income group."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01494,2023-11-07-T-016,1494,Saktiandi Supaat,"In general, I am reassured in terms of public transport, that the Government has kept public transport fares affordable.	Public transport is already heavily subsidised. The Government is actually spending quite extensively with the additional subsidies to lower the proportion of household income spent on public transport, which has fallen as well."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01495,2023-11-07-T-016,1495,Saktiandi Supaat,"Before I go into my last segment and conclude, I just want to reiterate some feedback from residents, highlighting thanks in terms of efforts from MOT and LTA in providing those transport vouchers to residents. Many of the residents have come forward to seek help in terms of transport vouchers. I think that sort of additional help on that front has helped, especially with the recent changes in the monthly passes as well."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01496,2023-11-07-T-016,1496,Saktiandi Supaat,Another example I want to highlight before I end is the additional U-Save rebates announced last month that will serve to cushion the impact of increases in carbon tax and water price.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01497,2023-11-07-T-016,1497,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the carbon tax itself is something that the WP has also agreed on in this House, that there is a need for Singapore to implement for the sake of our planet and also for our country."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01498,2023-11-07-T-016,1498,Saktiandi Supaat,"Over the next two years, the additional U-Save rebates will, on average, fully offset the increase in utility bills for 1- to 2-room HDB flats, about 80% for 3- to 4-room HDB flats, and about 65% for larger flats. This is another way that the Government is making sure that the cost of living pressures on the lower-income households are moderated even when we need to make the hard decisions of implementing such policies at this juncture."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01499,2023-11-07-T-016,1499,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, the Government has taken active wide-ranging steps to cushion the impacts of inflationary pressures on ordinary Singaporeans and has helped reduce their vulnerability to price increases through various measures, through monetary policies, fiscal assistance and also at the grassroots and through discretionary measures that can be undertaken on top of ComCare and welfare assistance."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01500,2023-11-07-T-016,1500,Saktiandi Supaat,"Ultimately, the global inflationary environment and pressing needs from Singapore society, such as an ageing population, mean that there are multiple fiscal demands that the Singapore Government needs to meet. As a society, we will all need to take on a fair share of these cost pressures where the Government will ensure that it is affordable for the average Singaporean while taking special targeted measures to provide more assistance for the lower-income groups who have heavier financial burdens."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01501,2023-11-07-T-016,1501,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my view that this approach is more prudent than deferring these real demands to future years, which would simply be kicking the can down the road where we do not know if the same or new inflationary pressures would be around. There is no guarantee that we may already have shifted into a new normal of higher prices. In this vein, there may not come a better time to implement some of these policies. Mr Speaker, I support the amended Motion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01502,2023-11-07-T-016,1502,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Chee.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01503,2023-11-07-T-016,1503,Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I have checked and would like to confirm that if we look at the total water consumption in Singapore, 45% comes from the domestic sector and 55% is from the non-domestic sector. I apologise for my error earlier. Sir, for potable water, the split is 60% domestic and 40% non-domestic."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01504,2023-11-07-T-016,1504,Speaker,Mr Xie Yao Quan.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01505,2023-11-07-T-016,1505,Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01506,2023-11-07-T-016,1506,Xie Yao Quan,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Official data shows that since July 2021, which is in the past 20 months, the price of eggs has gone up by almost 40%. Price of chilled chicken saw similar increases. Food and food ingredient prices have gone up by 11%. For F&B establishments, including hawker centres, coffee shops and restaurants, prices have gone up by 12.5%."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01507,2023-11-07-T-016,1507,Xie Yao Quan,"Many residents have told me that the extent and speed of cost-of-living price increases have become unbearable. Previously, you can buy a lot of things with $50 at the wet market, but now it does not buy you much."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01508,2023-11-07-T-016,1508,Xie Yao Quan,"As Members of Parliament, we feel keenly the impact of cost of living on Singaporeans in the past two years. Thus, today's debate is of great significance and precisely because of this, our debate should stick to the facts and analyse the factors behind the rise in cost of living objectively and accurately, and take a realistic approach to alleviate concerns of Singaporeans. This includes various considerations, trade-offs and compromise so as to avoid politicising this issue."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01509,2023-11-07-T-016,1509,Xie Yao Quan,This is the responsibility that Members of Parliament and political leaders should take upon themselves. The first point I want to make is that GST should not be made the scapegoat of the increase in prices.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01510,2023-11-07-T-016,1510,Xie Yao Quan,"In the last two years, prices have gone up by more than 10% overall, but during this period, GST have gone up by one percentage point. A crucial point is that the Government has increased the subsidies for the lowest-income Singaporeans under the permanent GST Voucher scheme. This will fully offset the impact of GST increase on the 30% lowest-income Singaporeans. This means that the actual impact of GST increase on these Singaporeans is not two percentage points, but zero."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01511,2023-11-07-T-016,1511,Xie Yao Quan,"Even for middle-income Singaporeans, the actual impact of the GST increase is also much lower than one percentage point. Because the Government boldly launched the Assurance Package, the impact will only be felt five to 10 years later."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01512,2023-11-07-T-016,1512,Xie Yao Quan,"This means that the cost-of-living pressure that Singaporeans are experiencing now is due to other reasons, not GST. One key reason is the global market volatility and the rise in global prices. Singapore is a small country and we import many of our raw materials and goods, so we will be inevitably affected by fluctuations in global prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01513,2023-11-07-T-016,1513,Xie Yao Quan,"For example, global chicken feed price has increased in the past two years. So, we have experienced an increase in egg and chicken prices. Global oil and gas prices have also increased and directly affected our electricity price, MRT fare and prices of public services. As a small country, what can we do?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01514,2023-11-07-T-016,1514,Xie Yao Quan,"The Government has one major weapon, which is the Singapore dollar. Through strengthening the Singapore dollar exchange rate, we have managed to offset 2.5% of inflation."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01515,2023-11-07-T-016,1515,Xie Yao Quan,"I believe Singaporeans know that the strength of the Singapore dollar did not occur by chance. It is due to the Government's prudent management of the economy and finance. Individually, we can also take steps to cope. In fact, a lot of residents know that domestic prices are affected by the global market. Singaporeans can also take a prudent approach in spending."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01516,2023-11-07-T-016,1516,Xie Yao Quan,"When we talk about inflation, it is actually an aggregate of the price increases of all goods, but in this basket of goods, there are still cheaper choices available. For example, seafood. According to official data, average prices of red snapper and batang have indeed increased by 20% and we have seen this at the markets. But according to official data, the price of sea bass has remained stable during the same period. So, we can eat sea bass instead of red snapper and batang. Savvy saver are still able to save money."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01517,2023-11-07-T-016,1517,Xie Yao Quan,"Another important aspect is the increase in the prices of public services. The cost of public services is also affected by the global market and prices. For the increase in cost, the Government has chosen to increase prices to maintain high quality public services. This is the responsible way."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01518,2023-11-07-T-016,1518,Xie Yao Quan,"For Town Councils, although they are not Government departments, they also provide public services. Thus, the recent increase in Town Council S&CC charges also reflects these increases in cost. This is a responsible way to deal with cost increases. Besides the global market, another factor for the increase in the cost of living is our domestic wages. In particular, I would like to point out the increase in the wages of low-income Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01519,2023-11-07-T-016,1519,Xie Yao Quan,"Increasing the wages of low-income Singaporeans is the aim of the Government's Progressive Wage Model (PWM). This is an important policy. Because of PWM, between 2017 and 2022, the wages of low-income Singaporeans have increased by 2.9% annually. This is higher than the 1.8% annual wage increase of middle-income workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01520,2023-11-07-T-016,1520,Xie Yao Quan,"In the next five years, the Government will go one step further and aim to increase the wages of low-wage Singaporeans by up to 80%. This will benefit hundreds of thousands low-wage Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01521,2023-11-07-T-016,1521,Xie Yao Quan,Sustaining this wage increase of low-income workers at a faster pace than middle-income workers so as to close the gap between the two is something that the Government has put a lot of effort into.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01522,2023-11-07-T-016,1522,Xie Yao Quan,"As a Jurong GRC Member of Parliament, many of my residents have benefited from the PWM. So, I strongly support this policy, but this policy also implies that the overall domestic wage will increase and ultimately businesses will have to increase prices. A crucial consideration is whether Singaporeans support the PWM and whether they are willing to pay a little more so that low-income workers can earn more."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01523,2023-11-07-T-016,1523,Xie Yao Quan,"This also applies to hawker food prices. Hawkers are self-employed persons, so they are not included in the PWM, but they also work hard to make a living. They also want to earn more. After all, other Singaporeans are enjoying wage increases."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01524,2023-11-07-T-016,1524,Xie Yao Quan,"I believe that in the past two years, hawker food prices have increased by 13% on average. This reflects the reality. Hawker food prices have increased not just because food and electricity prices have increased. I have a resident who runs a noodle stall. He recently increased his prices by $0.50. I asked him, ""So, you have increased your prices."" He said, ""I have no choice."" What I was hesitant to ask was, actually, ""Others have increased prices and you are only increasing prices now?"""
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01525,2023-11-07-T-016,1525,Xie Yao Quan,"So, Singaporeans have to face the same question. Are we willing to pay a little more at hawker centres so that hawkers can earn a little more? Regardless whether they are low-income workers or self-employed persons, Government has another major initiative - Workfare. This provides direct payout to those Singaporeans who earn low income and it helps to supplement their income."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01526,2023-11-07-T-016,1526,Xie Yao Quan,"Through Workfare and PWM, on one hand, the Government directly supplements part of the wage increase of low-income Singaporeans; on the other hand, it guides businesses and consumers to take on part of the increase in cost through market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01527,2023-11-07-T-016,1527,Xie Yao Quan,"This reflects the fundamental policy of the Government, that is, a small country will always face big challenges. When we are faced with challenges, the Government faces the problem squarely and launches responsible and sustainable policies as there is no free lunch in the world."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01528,2023-11-07-T-016,1528,Xie Yao Quan,"The Government will directly bear part of the cost, while the rest is shared with the people. In the past, we have faced similar challenges and the current issue of cost of living is no exception. In fact, many Singaporeans are aware of this. Many residents have asked me, ""The Government is providing so much assistance. How can it be sustained?"""
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01529,2023-11-07-T-016,1529,Xie Yao Quan,"As long as the Government, people and business community continue to work closely together and contribute their part, I believe we can overcome the current challenge of cost of living."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01530,2023-11-07-T-016,1530,Xie Yao Quan,I support the amended Motion by Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01531,2023-11-07-T-016,1531,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Mr Speaker, I second the Motion as filed by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh. The discussion on the cost of living crisis which we are facing today, is not complete without a review on the state of inflation in the country."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01532,2023-11-07-T-016,1532,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In its October Monetary Policy Statement, the MAS shared its expectations for Consumer Price Index (CPI)-All Items inflation to average around 5% in 2023, down from 6.1% the year before, and for the inflation rate to average between 3.0% to 4.0% in 2024. In recent months, we have seen inflation rates gradually slowing down over the course of the year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01533,2023-11-07-T-016,1533,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The decline in overall inflation rates is perhaps cold comfort for many Singaporeans, as prices are ultimately continuing to rise even amid the high prices we are seeing today. And that this is still significantly higher than what we have been used to in Singapore, double that of the 1% to 2% average inflation rates in the last four decades."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01534,2023-11-07-T-016,1534,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Even if inflation rates return to lower levels, prices are now permanently higher. With crude prices rising meaningfully since the third quarter, potentially even hitting $150 as the World Bank has warned, food commodities prices threatening to climb even higher if we witness a strong El Niño, and the second order effects on inflation potentially coming through, inflationary pressures could well pick up."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01535,2023-11-07-T-016,1535,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Interestingly, the MAS expects core inflation to be lower than headline inflation at 2.5% to 3.5% for the year as a whole. Unlike many countries where core inflation is defined as that excluding food and energy costs, Singapore excludes accommodation and private road transport costs, which according to the MAS, and I quote, “are excluded as they tend to be significantly influenced by supply-side administrative policies and are volatile.”"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01536,2023-11-07-T-016,1536,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"While I accept that the MAS Core Inflation measure is used for monetary policy decisions, a person without knowledge of the technicalities will nonetheless find reports of a return to price stability as being different compared to their lived experience. After all, the CPI is meant to be a fixed basket of goods and services commonly consumed by resident households. And looking at the relative weight of accommodation cost as part of Singapore's CPI basket, it comes in at 21.97% – the highest single component."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01537,2023-11-07-T-016,1537,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Moreover, to say that accommodation costs have no direct impact on the monthly cash expenditure of most households in Singapore as they already own their homes, does not take away the fact that especially in a country like ours, which prioritises home ownership. The cost of purchasing a home is a big concern, as it is going to be the single largest expenditure item for the vast majority of households. It is not just any expenditure item, but one that relates to our basic need of providing for shelter and our livelihoods."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01538,2023-11-07-T-016,1538,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"As such, my speech today will primarily touch on housing, and as rightly pointed out by the MAS, is significantly influenced by supply-side administrative policies. Hence, we need to take a closer look at our supply-side policies to ensure prices are well managed."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01539,2023-11-07-T-016,1539,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Before I touch on housing, back to the October Monetary Policy Statement. The MAS took pains to reiterate that excluding the impact of the increase in GST rates both in 2023 and 2024, inflation rates would be lower. The question then is, why add fuel to fire?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01540,2023-11-07-T-016,1540,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Layering on a higher GST rate on top of the inflationary environment we see today with the rising prices of many essential goods and services, is only going to make it even more difficult for Singaporeans to cope with the mounting cost of living pressures. Should we not be insulating our people instead of hitting them with more? Even the MAS Chief Mr Ravi Menon has acknowledged the 1% dish point increase in GST, has an immediate impact on inflation."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01541,2023-11-07-T-016,1541,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"This is especially the case where I shared in my speech in Parliament just last month  the Government's fiscal position is shaping out to be much better than projected, with operating revenues now $8.2 billion higher in the first half of the financial year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01542,2023-11-07-T-016,1542,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"To reiterate, in Budget 2022, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong shared that the GST hike will bring in about 0.7% of GDP in revenues annually, or about $3.5 billion when the full hike is in place in 2024. Even with a one-percentage point increase in the GST thus far, the Government expects GST revenues in FY2023 to be $2.9 billion higher than FY2022."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01543,2023-11-07-T-016,1543,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In response to my speech, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat repeated the same response as that shared by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in the Budget 2023 round-up speech, where according to them both, “Deferring the GST increase will only store up more problems for the future, leaving us with less resources to take care of our growing fiscal needs and we cannot count on short-term upsides to fund structural needs.” Again, I listen very carefully to what Senior Minister of State Chee has said earlier, but the question here remains relevant. And that is, is deferring the GST hike in 2024, even for one year, when we have already achieved the revenue increase which the GST hike was meant to bring, going to store up more problems for the future?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01544,2023-11-07-T-016,1544,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Returning to the subject of my speech today, which is on housing costs. Based on the latest third quarter 2023 data, HDB resale prices continued its ascent, up about 1.3% from the last quarter, with the increase higher than the 1.2% quarter-on-quarter increase initially estimated for the quarter. This is despite additional cooling measures introduced more than a year ago in September 2022 involving tighter housing loan criteria and a new wait-out period of 15 months for current and former owners of private residential property to buy a non-subsidised HDB resale flat."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01545,2023-11-07-T-016,1545,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Compared to a year ago, public housing prices are now 6% higher versus private housing prices at about 4% higher. In each year since 2020, public housing price increases have outpaced that of the private residential market. And cumulatively, we have seen resale HDB prices up by 36%, compared to private residential at 28% since the start of 2020."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01546,2023-11-07-T-016,1546,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Moreover, it is not like what a Business Times columnist puts it, where he calls on Singaporeans to simply ""stay cool and do not go overboard chasing after million-dollar HDB flats"". While one may argue that the HDB resale market does not reflect the affordability of new BTO flats, ultimately, this will feed directly into the formula for pricing new BTO flats, as Minister Desmond Lee shared that, and I quote, ""When pricing new flats, HDB first establishes their market value by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby as well as the individual attributes of the flats, and prevailing market conditions."""
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01547,2023-11-07-T-016,1547,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Looking at the residential rental market, Minister Desmond Lee is hopeful that in the coming quarters, rental pressures are expected to further ease, as a significant number of residential units are completed, as shared in response to a PQ in September where Member Mr Henry Kwek asked, what more can the Ministry do to moderate or reverse escalating rental cost to help tenants manage their cost of living."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01548,2023-11-07-T-016,1548,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I agree with the Member's call and have, in March this year, also called on the Government to support Singaporeans intending to rent a house in the open market and to consider mechanisms to moderate rents in the housing market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01549,2023-11-07-T-016,1549,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"But while rental growth rates have moderated, compared to a year ago, private residential rents are up by 19%, well above overall inflation rates and up by close to 59% over the last three years. While the HDB does not publish a rental index, a comparison of median rentals across HDB towns paints a similar uncomfortable picture. Over the last three years, median rents for a 4-room HDB flat have risen by roughly 35% to 78%. Median rentals for a 4-room HDB flat in Sengkang, for example, is now at $3,200 a month compared to less than $2,000 three years ago."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01550,2023-11-07-T-016,1550,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"While we may say that as a country with close to 90% home ownership rate, those who need to rent form a minority. Soaring rents impact young Singaporeans who have not been able to purchase a flat but need their own space and households who may be particularly vulnerable given their tight financial circumstances and yet do not qualify for a public rental flat as they may be earning a household income of more than $1,500 a month, for example."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01551,2023-11-07-T-016,1551,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I am cognisant that the HDB website has recently been updated to remove references to any income figure and that HDB takes a needs-based approach and reviews all requests for public rental holistically. The ability to afford other housing options, such as renting from the open market or purchasing a flat remains debatable, in my view. This is especially if households are currently renting in the open market, and cannot afford the high resale prices today. Even if some can eventually secure a BTO flat, they would need a place to call home in the interim."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01552,2023-11-07-T-016,1552,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Just last month, there were two separate residents who lamented to me that their landlord is raising their rent to beyond their gross household income. In one case, his rent is going up from $1,500 to $2,500 a month, beyond his gross income of $2,200 a month; while in another case, his rent is going up from $3,200 to $4,200 a month and he cannot simply downgrade to a smaller flat due to his household size of eight. I have in January and March 2023, called for support measures for households in need and these cases are just a small subset of many Singaporeans who face similar predicaments."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01553,2023-11-07-T-016,1553,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Having described the challenges we are facing in the public housing market, I recognise that the Government agrees that there are issues relating to availability and affordability today. Where I believe our views differ however, is on the sufficiency of the current measures that have been taken."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01554,2023-11-07-T-016,1554,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"On housing availability, the Government has reiterated its position that it has significantly increased the supply of BTO flats and will launch up to 100,000 new flats in total from 2021 to 2025. Similarly, I have over the course of a number of speeches, shared that this may not be sufficient."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01555,2023-11-07-T-016,1555,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Even if the HDB launches 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, this implies that BTO supply falls 20% from current levels to about 18,400 flats in 2024 and 2025. Moreover, while the average of 20,000 BTO flats between 2021 to 2025 is an increase compared to average of 17,000 flats between 2016 and 2020, this is still 13% below the average of 23,000 flats in 2011 to 2015, during the time when Mr Khaw Boon Wan was the Ministry of National Development (MND) Minister and sought to address the backlog in HDB flats."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01556,2023-11-07-T-016,1556,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Moreover, while BTO application rates have in 2023 declined to about three times thus far, it remains unclear if the 1.6 times application rate seen in the October BTO exercise is sustainable, or just a result of the first-time introduction of certain specific rules."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01557,2023-11-07-T-016,1557,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"On housing affordability in Budget 2023, the Government has increased the CPF Housing Grant for first-time families to enhance housing affordability in the resale market. As what a head of research at one of the real estate agencies pointed out then, such beneficial effects could be short-lived as it could result in further price inflation, as these could be priced in by the market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01558,2023-11-07-T-016,1558,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In addition, with the new BTO classification system from second half 2024, Plus flats will be priced with more subsidies, on top of the subsidies already provided for standard flats today. Again, while the intention is to improve affordability, with the new classification applying only to new BTO launches and not to the existing stock of more than a million HDB units already in the market, the measures could potentially add further upside pressure to resale HDB prices in some of these locations. As reported by CNA last month, prices for flats located near MRT stations or town centres are now higher by up to $10,000 compared to before, according to industry insiders."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01559,2023-11-07-T-016,1559,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Moreover, there has not been any concrete policy proposals on addressing the needs of those needing to rent in the open market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01560,2023-11-07-T-016,1560,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In response to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) in January 2023, Minister Desmond Lee shared that, ""Providing subsidies or grants for renting flats in the open market is likely to induce demand and drive up market rents, which would compound rather than help solve matters. As such, we have no plans to provide such rental subsidies"". Is this not the exact approach that the Government is taking, when providing targeted subsidies to enhance affordability in the resale market? Why the double standards? Especially when it comes to vulnerable families who have not been able to obtain a public rental flat?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01561,2023-11-07-T-016,1561,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"What then should be done to address the issues of availability and affordability today? To put simply, if the fundamental demand-supply imbalance we are seeing today is not sufficiently addressed, the market is simply doing what it is supposed to do. With prices and rents continuing to appreciate, while many Singaporeans are not able to address their housing needs. If the idea is not to crimp the real demand side of the equation since access to appropriate housing and shelter is a basic need for all, addressing these problems would then necessarily require adjustments to the supply side of the equation, for the market to find a more appropriate equilibrium point."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01562,2023-11-07-T-016,1562,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In other words, we need to increase the supply of HDB flats across both the for-purchase market and also the neglected for-rent market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01563,2023-11-07-T-016,1563,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Rather than reduce the supply of BTO flats by close to 20% from 2024 onwards, we ought to ensure that we keep up with the current pace of launches, and this is only just about in line with the average of 23,000 flats from 2011 to 2015."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01564,2023-11-07-T-016,1564,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"As I have shared in my MND Committee of Supply speech, a local academic put it very succinctly, and I quote, “Having excess flats is actually a feature and not a bug. It just means that if some Singaporean want to get married and wants a new house straight away, there is a house available!” And he goes on further to say, “To me, BTO is the real culprit behind our uncontrolled fire”."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01565,2023-11-07-T-016,1565,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Moreover, a lot of the demand from first time home buyers in the resale market today is also a function of the long wait times for a new BTO flat. To take it one step further from ensuring adequate supply, we ought to also ensure that we strive to continue reducing the long waiting times for a BTO flat and build a larger percentage of flats ahead of demand, as I have shared in my MND Committee of Supply speeches over the years."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01566,2023-11-07-T-016,1566,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"After all, if we can build industrial facilities ahead of demand, can we not also build residential homes ahead of demand and have a fundamental re-think of the BTO system? I do appreciate Minister Desmond Lee's assurance that the HDB is planning to launch more Shorter Waiting Time flats, of around 2,000 to 3,000 flats per year by 2025. However, this is essentially at similar levels to the number of such flats launched in the last five years, ranging from about 1,096 in 2018 to 2,850 in 2020."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01567,2023-11-07-T-016,1567,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In the rental market, it is alarming that while there continues to be a very limited stock of rental flats today, the pace of construction appears to be slowing drastically compared to before. As at FY2022, there were 63,681 rental flats under management, a net increase of about 541 flats in the five years since FY2018. That appears to be a noticeable slowdown compared to the average net increase of 1,640 units per year between 2011 and 2020."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01568,2023-11-07-T-016,1568,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The pace of development of rental flats is expected to slow down even further, where there are only 900 public rental flats currently under construction and will be completed in the next five years. In other words, just about 180 flats per year. Why are we constructing new rental flats at a pace which is a mere 10% of that in the past decade?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01569,2023-11-07-T-016,1569,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"To minimise the agonising wait for an allocation of a rental flat and to alleviate the worries of many Singaporeans who have not been able to access a rental flat, it is imperative that we do not neglect the housing needs of vulnerable Singaporeans in our pursuit of home ownership as the only acceptable housing model for Singapore. And it is important for us to resume the pace of rental flat construction, to be at least on par with the net increase between 2011 and 2020."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01570,2023-11-07-T-016,1570,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"While the supply side solutions I have proposed to address the current predicament are not new per se, and various WP MPs, including myself, have called for this during the Housing Motion debate and MND Committee of Supply debates in recent years, what is worth highlighting is that demand appears to be much higher than what was previously expected; or at least what I had previously expected."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01571,2023-11-07-T-016,1571,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"It appears that Singapore's population grew at 5% to 5.92 million as of June 2023, the fastest growth rate since 2008. This could partly explain the tightness we are seeing in the housing market today. And while I am not privy to the Government's desired population growth rate, if such growth rates persist, then we could have an even bigger problem down the line with housing supply set to taper off from next year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01572,2023-11-07-T-016,1572,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Coupled with the steady decline in average household sizes, it now appears that elevated levels of housing demand are likely to be more permanent than transient, and we need to better prepare our housing market for this reality."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01573,2023-11-07-T-016,1573,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Finally, as an adjacent point, even if we have successfully adjusted our policies to address the current cost of living crisis, addressing the issue of soaring public housing prices today does bring us to the next logical question – what will happen when we reset prices downwards?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01574,2023-11-07-T-016,1574,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The lease decay issue continues to be the elephant in the room, and more than five years since the term ""VERS"" entered our lexicon in Prime Minister Lee's National Day Rally speech in 2018, many unanswered questions remain."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01575,2023-11-07-T-016,1575,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Even as we debate the issue of soaring housing prices today, we cannot be silent on the eventuality of the value of HDB flats reaching zero at the end of the 99-year lease, as this will simply mean that the higher the rise in prices today, the harder the fall eventually. In Mandarin please, Mr Speaker."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01576,2023-11-07-T-016,1576,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Although the inflation rate has eased in the recent months, prices remain high and continued to be on the rise for many Singaporeans, and the current inflation rate is still much higher than what we were used to."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01577,2023-11-07-T-016,1577,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I would like to reiterate that the Government's fiscal situation is currently much better than expected. In this cost-of-living crisis, when we have already achieved the revenue growth expected from the GST hike, will delaying the GST hike until 2024, even only for a year, bring more problems for the future as the Government has said?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01578,2023-11-07-T-016,1578,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Regarding public housing, the latest data shows that as of June 2023, Singapore's population has grown by 5% to reach 5.92 million. This is the fastest growth rate since 2008. Last year, the number of registered marriages also reached an all-time high in our country's history. If the population growth rate continues, we may face even bigger problems as public housing supply will decrease by nearly 20% from 2024."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01579,2023-11-07-T-016,1579,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"To effectively address the housing problem, we need to adjust the housing supply, so that the market can find a more suitable equilibrium. In other words, we need to increase the supply in the BTO market, as well as the rental market which has been overlooked."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01580,2023-11-07-T-016,1580,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Mr Speaker, I hope the Government will seriously consider the points that we have raised to alleviate the cost-of-living pressure for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01581,2023-11-07-T-016,1581,Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01582,2023-11-07-T-016,1582,Yeo Wan Ling,"Mr Speaker, we have just come out of a three-year global pandemic and it was not too long ago, that many parts of the world were still completely shut in, logistics lines cut off, and our roads, malls, offices empty. We are now rebuilding our communities, our businesses and our trade links. This is a mammoth task made even more complicated with the ongoing wars."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01583,2023-11-07-T-016,1583,Yeo Wan Ling,"As we traverse the new world in the new normal, and as we pick up pieces – broken families, familiar places now gone, groups dispersed – we find ourselves in the middle of a hurricane of cost increases and resource shortages. From petrol, electricity and water, to bus rides, cai png and kopi – indeed, the global cost increases are felt at very local, very personal and very real everyday ways."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01584,2023-11-07-T-016,1584,Yeo Wan Ling,"In Punggol, a town of young families, many with upwardly aspirations, my residents have shared with me their concerns over food prices, healthcare costs, utilities and tuition enrichment classes for their children and, of course, the cost of owning a car and property in Singapore. They have expressed their appreciation for GST Vouchers, CDC Vouchers, U-Save Vouchers, Transport Vouchers, bursaries and top-ups that they have received over the years to help with cost pressures."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01585,2023-11-07-T-016,1585,Yeo Wan Ling,"For some residents who have fallen on tough times post-COVID-19, perhaps from being retrenched, a business gone south or having fallen gravely ill, help is never too far away with SSO, CDCs, Medical Social Workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01586,2023-11-07-T-016,1586,Yeo Wan Ling,"For those who have somehow fallen through the cracks – a single parent, a caregiver wishing to return to work, an undiagnosed special needs adult, our local community welfare teams provide weekly ration packs, monthly essential items, care vouchers and pro-bono services, like legal clinics, respite care and counselling sessions."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01587,2023-11-07-T-016,1587,Yeo Wan Ling,"Our Town Council, too, has also formalised a welfare committee assisting residents who have fallen behind on their S&CC fees or needing simple repairs around their homes. Support, of all shapes and sizes, are readily available and always at hand. And yet, in Punggol, I have observed that there are more who are stepping up to support the community instead."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01588,2023-11-07-T-016,1588,Yeo Wan Ling,"Indeed, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going! Complementing national level policies, micro-spheres of influence make long-term, impactful differences on the ground. Our micro-spheres of merchants, small businesses, religious organisations, volunteer groups and charities have created a sustainable and wide web of safety nets for our residents."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01589,2023-11-07-T-016,1589,Yeo Wan Ling,"I am touched that our temples, themselves reeling from low temple donations during COVID-19, now provide weekly rations to my welfare team, packed full of nutritious goodies to be distributed to our residents. Our temples, churches and mosques give free Maths and Language tuition for our residents, and they doubled their classes post-COVID-19 when demand surged."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01590,2023-11-07-T-016,1590,Yeo Wan Ling,"A moral welfare society is now building a free traditional chinese medicine (TCM) clinic to complement primary care in Punggol. All residents across all households and age groups are welcome. Many volunteers at the tuition and TCM centres are retired educators and healthcare professionals, and I appreciate how Singaporeans stepping up to support their communities."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01591,2023-11-07-T-016,1591,Yeo Wan Ling,"Our Punggol Merchants' Association sprung into action and introduced, with the help of our residents, $3 budget meals at all Punggol Shore food court stalls. One food court operator took it further and partnered with the National Taxi Association with the introduction of a free kopi programme card to address the livelihood crunch that our drivers face. They have since extended this programme islandewide. Such budget meals and kopi programmes are popular and welcomed, and I understand that the MND has introduced budget meals at all HDB-owned coffeeshops. Can we also consider getting privately-owned coffeeshops to also offer budget meals, perhaps through their Merchant Associations?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01592,2023-11-07-T-016,1592,Yeo Wan Ling,"With all these examples, I do believe in our businesses and community ecosystems – to do right for themselves and for our community – in the face of challenges and pressures, finding the right balance between costs of living and costs of business. Perhaps, instead of looking at this as a tug of war, let us support and help our businesses, our SMEs, our towkays do something that they do best in, and that is selling their goods and services well, and creating good jobs, future-ready good jobs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01593,2023-11-07-T-016,1593,Yeo Wan Ling,"The Labour Movement supports our companies with the upskilling of their workers and the redesign of jobs, so that more pockets of workers – such as caregivers, women returners – can partake in the workforce, and alleviate income pressures at home."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01594,2023-11-07-T-016,1594,Yeo Wan Ling,"An example of such a programme is the C U Back at Work, or CUB, Programme that the NTUC Woman and Family Unit has piloted to help mothers and family caregivers to return to the workplace confidently. Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) is key to the program, and companies redesign work hours or locations around the time availability of workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01595,2023-11-07-T-016,1595,Yeo Wan Ling,"Instead of price cuts and the passing on of costs to just another stakeholder upstream or downstream, FWAs can solve financial stresses for Singaporean families by adding an extra channel of income and help companies with resources and productivity."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01596,2023-11-07-T-016,1596,Yeo Wan Ling,"Hence, Mr Speaker, let us help our Singapore businesses do better in what they have set out to do. I call on our Government to reduce business costs by simplifying work and Government compliance processes for our businesses, and to support our companies in job redesign and the upskilling of workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01597,2023-11-07-T-016,1597,Yeo Wan Ling,"Mr Speaker, true character is shown in times of adversity. And indeed, in the face of global price surges and its impact on everyday life of Singaporeans, I have seen the mettle in our Singaporean businesses, I have felt the kindness in our communities and I have heard the steely timbre in our people's voices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01598,2023-11-07-T-016,1598,Yeo Wan Ling,"As the dust settles, let us continue to be united stakeholders in building our Singapore community, economy and lives with kindness and resolve, even when we have global challenges looms ahead. Mr Speaker, I support the amended Motion proposed by hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01599,2023-11-07-T-016,1599,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01600,2023-11-07-T-016,1600,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, thank you for letting me join the debate. Acting Minister Chee had earlier shared in detail on how we tackle rising costs – managing the Singapore dollar to contain imported inflation, ensuring our economy remains competitive to create good jobs and sustain real income growth, and providing support packages targeted especially for vulnerable groups."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01601,2023-11-07-T-016,1601,Sim Ann,"I wish to respond to some specific points raised by Members on topics including housing affordability, cooked food prices and profiteering."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01602,2023-11-07-T-016,1602,Sim Ann,"First, on housing affordability. Members would recall we have had an extensive debate in this Chamber in February on housing affordability and even more recently, there was a major announcement on upcoming changes to the BTO classification framework."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01603,2023-11-07-T-016,1603,Sim Ann,"Before I respond to points made by Members, including Mr Louis Chua and Mr Leong Mun Wai, please allow me to set out the Government's overall approach towards maintaining stability in the housing market."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01604,2023-11-07-T-016,1604,Sim Ann,"As economic conditions improve and wages rise in Singapore over the long term, we expect to see this reflected in a gradual rise in housing values and prices. Sudden shocks in either the public or private housing markets will cause serious problems and even hardship for Singaporeans, and this is why the Government actively uses policy levers to moderate price increases."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01605,2023-11-07-T-016,1605,Sim Ann,What do these levers comprise?
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01606,2023-11-07-T-016,1606,Sim Ann,"First, careful land use planning, coupled with a land recycling strategy, to ensure a steady supply of both public and private housing, to meet Singaporeans' needs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01607,2023-11-07-T-016,1607,Sim Ann,"Second, pricing BTOs, which by the way, in response to the point made about the five ""C""s, these BTOs have become more and more similar to condominiums, in terms of build quality and aesthetics. Pricing these BTOs with a view to affordability, not cost recovery."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01608,2023-11-07-T-016,1608,Sim Ann,"Third, demand-side levers for public housing such as grants and priority schemes for various categories of buyers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01609,2023-11-07-T-016,1609,Sim Ann,"Fourth, maintaining controls on home loan financing, whether through CPF or cash to encourage prudence on the part of home buyers and moderate price increases in the HDB resale and private property markets."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01610,2023-11-07-T-016,1610,Sim Ann,"And fifth, additional measures such as ABSD to cool the overall housing market where necessary."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01611,2023-11-07-T-016,1611,Sim Ann,Recent housing price movements have been due to specific imbalances which the Government has identified. The first imbalance  our building programme fell behind in the last three years due to COVID and we are catching up.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01612,2023-11-07-T-016,1612,Sim Ann,"To date, HDB has completed close to 75% of the projects delayed by the pandemic and should complete the rest of the delayed flats by early 2025. And we are committed to launch up to 100,000 new flats between 2021 and 2025."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01613,2023-11-07-T-016,1613,Sim Ann,"The resumption of delivery of private housing will also, over time, ease the crunch in private housing and moderate rentals and home prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01614,2023-11-07-T-016,1614,Sim Ann,"The second imbalance. HDB resale prices have risen significantly in recent years. This is due to buyers turning to resale when BTO construction was affected by COVID-related delays and shifts in social norms prompted by the experience of the pandemic, contributing to overall increase in housing demand. The catch-up in BTO supply will help moderate demand for resale units as people move into the homes they have booked."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01615,2023-11-07-T-016,1615,Sim Ann,"We have implemented two rounds of cooling measures in December 2021 and September 2022. Coupled with the broader economic climate and mortgage interest rate increases, these have moderated property prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01616,2023-11-07-T-016,1616,Sim Ann,"The prices of private residential properties increased by 0.8% in 3Q2023, lower than the quarterly average of 2.1% in 2022. Similarly, prices of HDB resale flats increased by 1.3% in 3Q2023, a figure that I believe Mr Louis Chua also quoted just now. And this is lower than the quarterly average of 2.5% in 2022."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01617,2023-11-07-T-016,1617,Sim Ann,"The third imbalance. This is the fact that mature estate BTOs had presented a specific set of concerns. The price of mature estate BTOs drove much of the ground concern about BTO prices. So, when people talked about BTO prices being a concern, they were mostly talking about the BTO prices that they saw in the mature estates."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01618,2023-11-07-T-016,1618,Sim Ann,"The issue we faced was how to price mature estate BTOs because these are very sought after so that they do not rise out of reach of most buyers and also not in a way that induces its own demand, which is why we announced the introduction of a new housing framework, comprising a new classification of ""Standard"", ""Plus"" and ""Prime"" flats, to take effect from the second half of 2024 onwards."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01619,2023-11-07-T-016,1619,Sim Ann,"The new framework seeks to ensure homeownership remains affordable, including in choice areas, by providing additional subsidies to these flats, but also tighter restrictions, so that they are affordable even upon resale."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01620,2023-11-07-T-016,1620,Sim Ann,"This also helps to keep our system of subsidies fair, while keeping to market principles. This means that we can also maintain a good social mix, even in good locations, because housing will be accessible to a wider range of Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01621,2023-11-07-T-016,1621,Sim Ann,"Based on our ground engagements, Singaporeans are generally aware of and support the new housing framework and its objectives. This will help implementation go more smoothly next year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01622,2023-11-07-T-016,1622,Sim Ann,"So, measures are in place for each of the specific imbalances causing price increases in BTO, resale and the private housing markets."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01623,2023-11-07-T-016,1623,Sim Ann,"Despite having to tackle these imbalances, we have broadly maintained measures of public housing affordability. In 2022, eight in 10 first time home buyers of BTO and resale flats had a Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) of 25% or less upon key collection. This meant that they could finance their monthly instalment with CPF, with little to no cash outlay."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01624,2023-11-07-T-016,1624,Sim Ann,"The Government will continue to monitor closely and adjust policies whenever necessary. And I am glad that Mr Louis Chua acknowledges our housing moves. However, he seems to think that we have not done enough. I noticed that Mr Louis Chua had co-authored a piece in January this year, saying housing in Singapore is affordable. Perhaps, he no longer thinks so. But I am glad that he agrees that the fundamental issue with housing affordability is one of supply, not policy."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01625,2023-11-07-T-016,1625,Sim Ann,Supply was indeed disrupted due to COVID. But we are catching up with the backlog.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01626,2023-11-07-T-016,1626,Sim Ann,"Mr Louis Chua seems to think we should build more. In fact, HDB is already doing all it can on the supply side. We have also activated more levers on the demand side, for instance, by prioritising BTO flats for young married couples."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01627,2023-11-07-T-016,1627,Sim Ann,"Through catching up on supply and managing demand, we are stabilising the housing market and there are signs that this is happening."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01628,2023-11-07-T-016,1628,Sim Ann,"Launching 100,000 flats from 2021 to 2025 which I mentioned previously means a commitment of 20,000 flats per year. And prior to 2019, HDB launched about 16,000 to 17,000 new flats per year, a figure that Mr Louis Chua had also noted."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01629,2023-11-07-T-016,1629,Sim Ann,"But at that time, the WP thought that was too many and said so. Now, we have 20,000 flats per year and it seems the WP thinks it is too few. So, I have to ask what figure does the WP propose? And should your higher number be adopted and if the market comes down due to over-supply, then, what will your party be saying then?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01630,2023-11-07-T-016,1630,Sim Ann,"I notice that Mr Louis Chua appeared to express some puzzlement about where all this demand for housing is coming from and he seems to want to link this to population increase. In fact, Mr Louis Chua should know because we have brought this up, we have mentioned this during the debate on the housing Motion in February this year. We have been building HDB flats faster than the HDB population growth."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01631,2023-11-07-T-016,1631,Sim Ann,"And, in fact, the average number of persons constituting each HDB household has been going down. This is the decrease in household size that Mr Louis Chua has also noted."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01632,2023-11-07-T-016,1632,Sim Ann,"And what is the cause of this reduction in household size? One factor, and I think this is a long-term one, has to do with the fact that we have heard the housing aspirations of singles and we have, over the years, progressively provided more housing options for the singles so that there are more housing types that they can buy, be it on the resale or the BTO market. And, in fact, we have further open this up with the new BTO classification framework that was announced."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01633,2023-11-07-T-016,1633,Sim Ann,"Given rising rates of singlehood, even if the population were to remain completely static, demand for housing is going to increase over time because the reduction of household sizes is set to continue. This is the reason why I seek Mr Louis Chua and the WP support for all our levers on both the demand as well as on the supply side. Please support us in having a robust recycling strategy for our land in addition to having careful land planning."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01634,2023-11-07-T-016,1634,Sim Ann,Let me now turn to some points that Mr Leong Mun Wai has repeated. These are familiar points because he has also raised them during the debate in February.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01635,2023-11-07-T-016,1635,Sim Ann,"He talked about the PSP's proposal of an ""Affordable Housing Scheme"". And as far as I can make out, the affordable housing scheme tries to do a few things. It seeks to achieve dramatically lower BTO prices by leaving out land cost at the point of first purchase, while seeking to assure existing homeowners that their home values will not be destroyed via a crash in the resale market and avoiding being seen as raiding the Reserves. These are the three aims."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01636,2023-11-07-T-016,1636,Sim Ann,"However, the first aim is simply incompatible with the second and the third aims, which is why the proposal was met with considerable scepticism, from Members of this House as well as the public."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01637,2023-11-07-T-016,1637,Sim Ann,"More importantly, the affordable housing scheme does not address the specific imbalances in the housing market that the Government has already responded to and identified. For example, dramatically lowering BTO prices is likely to trigger even more demand, especially in the very popular prime areas, instead of moderating demand. On the other hand, the Plus/Prime model which we have announced will address this concern."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01638,2023-11-07-T-016,1638,Sim Ann,I now turn to Mr Leong Mun Wai's mention of his Millennial Apartments scheme and I would also like to address some points that Mr Louis Chua has made about addressing the rental market in flats.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01639,2023-11-07-T-016,1639,Sim Ann,I say this to Mr Leong Mun Wai and Mr Louis Chua. Let us listen to what younger Singaporeans want. MND and HDB have been engaging Singaporeans at large but also younger home buyers or prospective home buyers. And most of the younger Singaporeans we have engaged indicated a preference to own their own homes; own rather than rent.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01640,2023-11-07-T-016,1640,Sim Ann,"So, we are not closed to new ideas. We have, indeed, been hearing inputs from Singaporeans about alternative typologies of housing but we also have to recognise that the very strong desire for home ownership is present within Singaporeans and we will have to prioritise building for home ownership, not so much building for rent, especially if we are talking about people of middle-income. But we will, first, make sure that there are still public rental options for those who are unable to attain the goal of home ownership."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01641,2023-11-07-T-016,1641,Sim Ann,"Also, we are ramping up supply for the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS). We will have close to 2,000 PPHS flats at the end of this year and we seek to double this to 4,000 by 2025."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01642,2023-11-07-T-016,1642,Sim Ann,"In terms of how the rents are moving in response to the various measures that have been undertaken, I would like to share that private and public housing rents are showing signs of stabilising."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01643,2023-11-07-T-016,1643,Sim Ann,"In the second quarter of 2023, the increase in private and public housing rents moderated to 2.8% and 3.0% respectively, as compared to 7.2% and 4.4% in the previous quarter and we expect this to further ease as more homes are completed and become ready for their owners to move into."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01644,2023-11-07-T-016,1644,Sim Ann,"Allow me to move onto concerns raised by several Members, including Mr Leong Mun Wai, Ms He Ting Ru, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Mr Xie Yao Quan on food, especially cooked food."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01645,2023-11-07-T-016,1645,Sim Ann,"We had proactively launched the Budget Meal initiative in 2023 to increase the availability of affordable food options in HDB estates, especially for residents who need them."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01646,2023-11-07-T-016,1646,Sim Ann,"These budget meal options are typically lunch or dinner meal options that are priced affordably and are comparable to meals sold at lower price points at nearby eateries, including HDB coffee shops or hawker centres."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01647,2023-11-07-T-016,1647,Sim Ann,"We have observed that rental coffeeshops leased under the Price-Quality Method (PQM) tenders typically provide budget food options with prices at around $3 to $3.50, across different estates. I should add at this point that operator proposals for PQM tenders that include healthier food options are already given more points and more favourably considered under the quality criteria. So, I want to thank Ms He Ting Ru for supporting this idea. We are already doing it."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01648,2023-11-07-T-016,1648,Sim Ann,"Currently, some 114 HDB rental eating houses offer budget meals and drinks. And by 2026, budget meals will be offered at all 374 HDB rental coffeeshops. Members of public can use the BudgetMealGoWhere site to find out what budget meals are offered at HDB coffeeshops near them. HDB also puts up decals at participating coffeeshops to help residents identify the participating stalls more easily."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01649,2023-11-07-T-016,1649,Sim Ann,"However, while we help residents with their cost of food, we are also mindful that rising costs affect everyone, including coffeeshop operators and stallholders."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01650,2023-11-07-T-016,1650,Sim Ann,"To ease the transition for them, HDB has also offered a rental discount of 5% off the market valuation-based renewal rents for a period of one year from the time of the tenancy being renewed, subject to verification that the new budget meals and drinks have been implemented."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01651,2023-11-07-T-016,1651,Sim Ann,"In the spirit of partnering Singaporeans under Forward Singapore, we soft-launched an effort last month to crowdsource the public's recommendations and verification of budget meals in coffee shops across the island."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01652,2023-11-07-T-016,1652,Sim Ann,"Using the CrowdTaskSG portal, the public can be part of this nation-wide pilot campaign called the Great Budget Meal Hunt by submitting information on affordable meals they would recommend to others or by verifying the details of a budget meal listed on the BudgetMealGoWhere site. Over the past week and a half, we have received 245 recommendations of affordable meals and 319 verifications across 91 coffee shops. We welcome Singaporeans to contribute actively to this initiative."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01653,2023-11-07-T-016,1653,Sim Ann,"While the current budget meal initiative only applies to coffee shops rented out by HDB, there are also sold eating houses that are privately owned. HDB is studying regulatory options to require budget meals to be provided in these sold eating houses. This includes making the provision of budget meals a condition for the renewal of use of the outdoor refreshment areas – an idea that Mr Murali Pillai had raised previously."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01654,2023-11-07-T-016,1654,Sim Ann,We will continue to work with coffee shop operators to find sustainable ways to offer affordable food options to residents.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01655,2023-11-07-T-016,1655,Sim Ann,Some Members have also raised their concerns that businesses may take advantage of the inflationary environment to raise prices exorbitantly.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01656,2023-11-07-T-016,1656,Sim Ann,"The Government takes a strong stance against profiteering and will not hesitate to take action if there is a case to be made. To date, the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP), which I note Ms Hazel Poa also sits in, has received over 350 feedback submissions, of which 32 cases have been found to involve GST misrepresentation and which have been resolved."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01657,2023-11-07-T-016,1657,Sim Ann,"If Mr Leong has concerns about GST misrepresentation, in other words, a business unjustifiably raising prices by attributing it to GST increase, he can make a submission too to the CAP."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01658,2023-11-07-T-016,1658,Sim Ann,"However, there is also broad recognition also that many businesses are facing rising costs, as Mr Mark Lee has pointed out, including the cost of utilities, manpower, rental and raw materials, and some may need to raise prices in order to remain viable. These could include our hawkers and SMEs."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01659,2023-11-07-T-016,1659,Sim Ann,"The best safeguard against profiteering is healthy competition. We have a robust system in place to remove impediments to competition and encourage a diversified supply chain, which help to ensure that businesses compete fairly and that consumers have sufficient choices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01660,2023-11-07-T-016,1660,Sim Ann,"The Government keeps a close watch on the prices of essential goods and services, especially during this challenging period, and will not hesitate to investigate anti-competitive behaviour. Should a member of the public come across such egregious cases, they can report this to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE)."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01661,2023-11-07-T-016,1661,Sim Ann,"If Ms Hazel Poa, as she said in her speech, felt that the scope of the CAP that she sits on is not sufficient for possible upstream cases of price rises to be investigated, I think CCCS would be glad to hear from her with regards to specific details and investigate them."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01662,2023-11-07-T-016,1662,Sim Ann,"To further help Singaporeans make better purchase decisions on essentials, CASE has developed an app Price Kaki to compare the prices of items sold at supermarkets. To address potential concerns about shrinkflation, CASE has introduced a unit pricing feature this year on Price Kaki to help consumers more easily compare the prices of products with different package sizes and across different brands."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01663,2023-11-07-T-016,1663,Sim Ann,"Specifically, on business rentals, Ms Hazel Poa had suggested releasing guidelines on fair rental prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01664,2023-11-07-T-016,1664,Sim Ann,The Parliament has passed a Bill mandating that tenants and landlords of qualifying retail premises comply with the leasing principles set out in the Code of Conduct for Leasing of Retail Premises in Singapore. This is to ensure industry-wide consistency in leasing principles and practices to provide certainty to landlords and tenants and set out a dispute resolution process that is affordable and expedient.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01665,2023-11-07-T-016,1665,Sim Ann,"The Act will take effect in early February 2024 as sufficient time has to be given for the industry to transition to mandatory compliance. The code will be reviewed and updated as necessary, based on feedback from industry players."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01666,2023-11-07-T-016,1666,Sim Ann,Let me now turn to some points on supporting persons with disabilities and caregiving that Mr Gerald Giam had raised.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01667,2023-11-07-T-016,1667,Sim Ann,"We empathise with the challenges of those who need additional support, such as caregivers and persons with disabilities. I beg your pardon, I think it was Mr Dennis Tan who raised these points."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01668,2023-11-07-T-016,1668,Sim Ann,"To Mr Dennis Tan's points, I would like to clarify that financial support schemes for caregivers such as the Home Caregiving Grant or the Migrant Domestic Worker Levy Concession do not just apply to caregivers of disabled seniors but persons with disabilities too, including care recipients with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01669,2023-11-07-T-016,1669,Sim Ann,"Similarly, all Singapore residents have basic health insurance coverage for life, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. MSF has also recently increased funding to adult disability homes and day activity centres in 2021. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01670,2023-11-07-T-016,1670,Sim Ann,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, cost of living is an issue that touches the lives of all. We have experienced high inflation for the last few years due to the dislocations in the global economy caused by the pandemic, conflict and geopolitical tensions."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01671,2023-11-07-T-016,1671,Sim Ann,"Right now, inflation is moderating, but we recognise that many households still feel the pressure from cost of living. That is why the Government has enhanced the Assurance Package to help everyone cope better. We try our best to operate public services efficiently and to keep costs low. However, cost is inevitable as things still cost money. When costs go up, despite our best efforts, they still have to be covered."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01672,2023-11-07-T-016,1672,Sim Ann,"For essentials, some of it will be covered by Government subsidies, for example, healthcare and public transport costs, but not all. Some part needs to be paid by consumers. Some consumers will need help with this. We will provide them targeted direct help if need be, for example, U-Save rebates and public transport vouchers. And those who need more help will get more support. This is much better than subsidising the product directly or having tiered pricing schemes because that is more expensive and less effective."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01673,2023-11-07-T-016,1673,Sim Ann,"Overall, we have provided high quality Government and public services to Singaporeans. The Government Budget is less than 20% of the GDP, which is much lower than most developed countries."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01674,2023-11-07-T-016,1674,Sim Ann,"Nevertheless, the Government's spending needs are rising steadily, especially in healthcare."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01675,2023-11-07-T-016,1675,Sim Ann,"The GST increase is essential for this. There is no good time to do it. But through the Assurance Package, the Government has effectively delayed the impact on most citizen households while getting the new rate implemented and the additional revenues flowing. For example, the bulk of the GST revenues are paid by higher-income groups as well as foreigners and tourists. While the Government is helping most Singaporean households, the higher-income groups as well as foreigners will contribute more to Government revenue."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01676,2023-11-07-T-016,1676,Sim Ann,"Through this combination of not delaying necessary adjustments while providing needed support to households, we can keep our public services and finances sound while helping Singaporeans going through a difficult time"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01677,2023-11-07-T-016,1677,Sim Ann,(In English)  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the point that was just raised – I believe it was by Mr Louis Chua – on delaying GST increase for one or two years on the basis that finances have been better than expected.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01678,2023-11-07-T-016,1678,Sim Ann,"We are actually doing much better than that. With the Assurance Package, we have delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households by at least five years and by about 10 years for lower-income households."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01679,2023-11-07-T-016,1679,Sim Ann,"In conclusion, we recognise the impact of inflationary pressures on Singaporeans. Many are cutting back on spending while we ride out the economic uncertainties. We empathise with these challenges and we will do more, if necessary."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01680,2023-11-07-T-016,1680,Sim Ann,"But, we have to do it right. This means  one. preserving market principles and not over-regulating – to allow the market to allocate resources and determine price so that we can have an efficient, productive economy while intervening decisively where market failures exist; and two, fiscal sustainability – to intervene prudently so as to remain responsible to future generations."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01681,2023-11-07-T-016,1681,Sim Ann,"In the longer term, the only bulwark against inflation is to remain competitive, to grow the economy and to achieve wage growth for all. This is the sustainable and sensible way ahead and this Government is committed to this mission."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01682,2023-11-07-T-016,1682,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments to the Motion raised by Mr Liang Eng Hwa."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01683,2023-11-07-T-016,1683,Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01684,2023-11-07-T-016,1684,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response to my speech. I just have a couple of clarifications."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01685,2023-11-07-T-016,1685,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"But before that, I do need to highlight that I think all of us agree here that policy-making needs to be dynamic. As what the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh, has said in his opening speech, we need to ensure that our policies are reflective of the circumstances today and tomorrow versus the past."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01686,2023-11-07-T-016,1686,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"In this regard, I also acknowledge and agree with the Senior Minister of State when she shared that the reduction in household sizes is a key factor in driving housing demand. I also note that just in the last five years, you see that the average household size has come down very rapidly from about 3.5 to close to about three."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01687,2023-11-07-T-016,1687,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I agree that even if the population remains static, that is going to be a significant source of demand, but the population is not static."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01688,2023-11-07-T-016,1688,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"At the same time, the uncertainty I was expressing is that if you look at the population growth rate today, that appears to be a step up, not just in percentage. If you look at it in absolute terms, I think the number is close to about 280,000 or 290,000 persons' increase in the last one year versus the increase of about 28,000 to 29,000 in the last five years' average. prior to COVID-19."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01689,2023-11-07-T-016,1689,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I think this is also a big question mark – as to what then is the forward looking policy when it comes to the incoming net migration, because as far as I understand, our total fertility rate (TFR) is at an all-time low. I think a lot of the new housing demand is also driven by the population policies."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01690,2023-11-07-T-016,1690,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"At the same time, as I shared in my speech, we are looking at a record high number of marriages. I think that was recently reported in the last one to two months. That appears, again, to be a step up in the housing demand versus what we have seen in the past decade or so."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01691,2023-11-07-T-016,1691,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"All these factors, put together, would suggest that perhaps, if we look at housing demand, that appears to have stepped up versus what it was previously. I agree with what the Senior Minister of State has shared earlier. So, the clarification – two clarifications here —"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01692,2023-11-07-T-016,1692,Speaker,It is a rather long preamble.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01693,2023-11-07-T-016,1693,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Sorry, the two clarifications here is that I understand that the Government has ramped up the supply of BTO flats, but I am still not sure as to why when it comes to rental flats, there is a significant reduction in the pace of increase."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01694,2023-11-07-T-016,1694,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Secondly, can I check with the Senior Minister of State to confirm if she believes that we have already cleared the backlog of demand from prior years?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01695,2023-11-07-T-016,1695,Sim Ann,"In response to Mr Louis Chua's questions, first of all, in terms of backlog, I have shared that we are in the process of clearing the backlog and that HDB has delivered close to 75% of the COVID-19 delayed projects. This will continue and we seek to get back on track."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01696,2023-11-07-T-016,1696,Sim Ann,"Not only do we seek to get back on track, we do recognise the need to have a buffer. This is also something that Members have talked about. It is something that we do agree with. We see the need for a buffer. This is also the reason why we are seeking to ramp up supply of Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) flats. We know that this is very important to Singaporeans who are waiting for key collection."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01697,2023-11-07-T-016,1697,Sim Ann,"In terms of population growth, we have discussed population growth in this House over the years. I do not propose to go over it in detail. Suffice to say, we have seen that in the last few years, due to COVID-19, that has caused very sharp fluctuations in population. I believe that the sharpest growth post-COVID-19 and the reopening of our economy in terms of non-citizens actually would be the category would not be living in our HDB flats, particularly, the migrant workers."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01698,2023-11-07-T-016,1698,Sim Ann,"But overall the Government is planning to ensure that through our land use planning as well as making sure that we have got all the supply side and demand side factors in place to ensure a steady supply, both of private as well as public housing."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01699,2023-11-07-T-016,1699,Sim Ann,And I thank Mr Louis Chua for also agreeing on the observations that I have made.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01700,2023-11-07-T-016,1700,Speaker,"I made these remarks yesterday, but I notice that today there are more Members who are in this House. I am going to repeat my remarks that I made yesterday. Which is that in the past, Members have taken this opportunity for raising points of clarification to make mini speeches before asking their clarification. As I highlighted yesterday, there have been occasions where one such mini speech exceeded five minutes."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01701,2023-11-07-T-016,1701,Speaker,"So, I want to remind Members that under Standing Order 48(3), no Member other than the mover – and in this case, it is Mr Pritam Singh – is allowed to speak more than once on a Motion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01702,2023-11-07-T-016,1702,Speaker,"Making a point of clarification or asking supplementary questions are not the occasions for a second speech. I will certainly allow some leeway for Members to explain their point of clarification or make your question intelligible, but I ask Members please, for your cooperation and understanding, to observe the Standing Orders and to keep your points of clarification and questions concise and to the point. Mr Leong Mun Wai."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01703,2023-11-07-T-016,1703,Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Speaker. I have two clarifications for the Senior Minister of State. One, the HDB recently reported a $5.38 billion dollars deficit. A lot of this is probably due to the subsidies given to the BTO buyers because HDB paid $5.9 billion to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) at the same time in the same year."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01704,2023-11-07-T-016,1704,Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, I have two questions  will this deficit $5.38 billion ultimately be paid by the Singaporean taxpayer? And two, when the Plus and Prime flats come into operations, will this deficit actually go up higher?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01705,2023-11-07-T-016,1705,Sim Ann,"Actually, I am very glad that Mr Leong seems to have come round to the idea that there is a deficit in our building programme and the deficit is made up by the subsidies that are given to Singaporeans; so, the answer is yes, these deficits are taxpayer-funded. That is why much as we would like to be as generous as we can, we also need to be responsible. We need to be good stewards of public resources and we have to run the public housing building programme with sustainability in mind."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01706,2023-11-07-T-016,1706,Sim Ann,"As to whether or not with the Prime and Plus going forward whether there will be more subsidies, I think that is not something that we can determine just simply by the introduction of the framework alone. But the intention of the framework is to streamline demand, streamline demands so that people would make quite prudent choices and it will emphasise the principle of owner occupation and what I can say to Mr Leong is that the subsidies will be very well used."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01707,2023-11-07-T-016,1707,Speaker,"Ms He Ting Ru. You did raise your hand, right? Yes."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01708,2023-11-07-T-016,1708,He Ting Ru,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a really quick clarification. I thank Senior of State for mentioning under the HDB PQM framework. I just wanted to make a quick clarification that in my speech, I was asking for more consideration and weightage to be given to outlets and restaurants that actually offer healthier options. I was not saying that it was not already being done. but I think the point is well taken."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01709,2023-11-07-T-016,1709,Sim Ann,"I think on the principle we are not disagreeing and I happened to share Ms He Ting Ru's passion for healthy food so this is certainly something that we will look into. But we also have to balance against the other relevant considerations for quality because after all, coffee shops do serve a wider range of consumers and residents. And people have different preferences for what they want to see in the coffee shop."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01710,2023-11-07-T-016,1710,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01711,2023-11-07-T-016,1711,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, I have one more clarification for the Senior Minister of State. So, comparing with our Affordable Home Scheme — of course, there will be issues that we still need to discuss about the Affordable Home Scheme. But the current Government home scheme, do you agree that it has led to high HDB prices? At the same time, every BTO flat, not only the buyers pay for the land cost but all Singaporeans have to pay for the deficit?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01712,2023-11-07-T-016,1712,Sim Ann,"I am afraid the nature of Mr Leong's question is not very clear. Could Mr Leong rephrase his question, Mr Speaker?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01713,2023-11-07-T-016,1713,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, sorry about that. What I mean is that I am trying to compare our Affordable Home Scheme with the current BTO scheme of the Government. Of course, there will be some disadvantages, some problems, some issues that we need to overcome, but I think the Affordable Home Scheme's problems can be overcome too."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01714,2023-11-07-T-016,1714,Leong Mun Wai,"So, we are making a policy decision here. The current BTO scheme has led to increasing prices of the BTO, because you have to incorporate the rising land cost. As a result, it has led to rising HDB prices. Secondly, every BTO flats need to be financed by HDB and it creates a deficit which, ultimately, is paid by all the Singaporeans. So, there are two disadvantages of the current BTO scheme. Do you agree to that?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01715,2023-11-07-T-016,1715,Sim Ann,I am afraid I will have to answer Mr Leong's question with a question of my own. He has not made clear how his Affordable Housing Scheme does not result in the outcome that he claims the BTO scheme has created?
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01716,2023-11-07-T-016,1716,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is only fair that Senior Minister of State answers my question first and then I will answer her question."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01717,2023-11-07-T-016,1717,Sim Ann,"As with every Government scheme, when circumstances evolve and change, it does prompt a review. However, I think that the comparison that Mr Leong is asking me to make is a spurious one because the Affordable Housing Scheme, as I have said before, is one which I do not think has convinced Members of this House or even many members of the public because it seeks to reconcile three quite incompatible aims."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01718,2023-11-07-T-016,1718,Sim Ann,"It seeks to dramatically lower BTO prices by leaving out land costs at the point of first purchase. But perhaps his party is worried that the scheme will be rejected outright by homeowners who are worried about a crash in the resale price so it tries to assure people that it does not do. And then also, the scheme seeks to avoid being seen as a raid on the Reserves. But as I have said these three aims are not compatible because by taking land cost out at the point of first purchase actually that already has an impact on the Reserves."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01719,2023-11-07-T-016,1719,Sim Ann,"This topic has been covered quite extensively over more than a day of debate in this House, so I do not propose to go through it again. But I do not see how I can make any meaningful comparison from between a scheme that has worked, and which requires adjustments from time to time to meet changing circumstances and evolving demand, with a scheme which, as far as we can tell, is actually not able to be internally consistent and is not one that has been convincing to both Members of this House and the public."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01720,2023-11-07-T-016,1720,Speaker,"If I may, actually this topic was subject to a debate in a previous Sitting for which we came to a conclusion. Let us come back to the Motion at hand and let us confine our clarifications to the speeches relating to the Motion proposed by Mr Pritam Singh. Mr Leong."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01721,2023-11-07-T-016,1721,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, it is exactly because of that, I am not asking for a revisit on the pros and cons of the Affordable Home Scheme. I am just saying that based on what the Senior Minister of State has said, does she agree that the current schemes has got these two disadvantages  one, HDB prices will continue to go up as long as land cost goes up; two, and when the Government or HDB sells the BTO flat, there will be a subsidy and this translate into HDB deficit and this deficit goes to the budget and all Singaporeans have to pay for it?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01722,2023-11-07-T-016,1722,Lim Biow Chuan,"A point of order, Mr Speaker. We have debated this time and again. We should not be wasting time on revisiting this debate over and over again. It is a waste of everyone's time. So, can I ask Mr Speaker to make a —"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01723,2023-11-07-T-016,1723,Lim Biow Chuan,"Mr Leong Mun Wai  Point of order, Sir. A point of order, Sir."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01724,2023-11-07-T-016,1724,Speaker,"Mr Leong, sit down first. Let Mr Lim make his point."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01725,2023-11-07-T-016,1725,Lim Biow Chuan,"So, can I invite Mr Speaker to make a decision on this so that we can move out of this debate. Otherwise, we will be going back to issues which we have debated over and over again, and now resurfacing yet again."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01726,2023-11-07-T-016,1726,Speaker,"Actually, I did say this. I thought Mr Leong was going to make a different point of clarification. I will allow one last response if Minister of State Sim Ann wants to make it; and then I am going to move on."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01727,2023-11-07-T-016,1727,Speaker,"Senior Minister of State Sim, would you like to respond to that last clarification by Mr Leong?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01728,2023-11-07-T-016,1728,Sim Ann,"I think Mr Leong is tying himself up in knots because if he considers the increase in housing prices over the years as a disadvantage of the scheme, is Mr Leong saying that prices must remain static in order for the housing market to be considered favourable and in order for our housing policy to be considered a success? In which case, I think Mr Leong did not pay attention when I explained that with favourable economic conditions and growing wages over time, we do expect to see a gradual increase in home values and prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01729,2023-11-07-T-016,1729,Sim Ann,"So, it seems to me that Mr Leong is tying himself up in knots and I am not convinced that members of the public will agree that static prices over the long term is what the housing policy should be aiming for."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01730,2023-11-07-T-016,1730,Sim Ann,"The second way in which he is tying himself up in knots is that by posing this question about deficit, the deficit incurred by HDB, to me, it seems to me that Mr Leong is denying that housing should be subsidised at all. If you want to subsidise any product, be it housing, be it education for that matter, defence, street lighting, these are public goods that are provided."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01731,2023-11-07-T-016,1731,Sim Ann,"In the case of housing, it is not 100% subsidised by Government; there is some payment from home owners. But the subsidy from Government and by extension taxpayers is very substantial; and therefore, it seems to me that Mr Leong's line of questioning will inevitably lead him to conclude that there should not be any subsidy."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01732,2023-11-07-T-016,1732,Sim Ann,"So, I really think that for both Mr Leong's good and for the House's good, I think we should pasue this because Mr Leong, you are leading yourself down a path of no return."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01733,2023-11-07-T-016,1733,Speaker,"Let me remind all Members of Standing Order 50, which relates to the point I made earlier. Can I invite Mr Pritam Singh to make your closing?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01734,2023-11-07-T-016,1734,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, thank you to all in the House who have spoken on this Motion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01735,2023-11-07-T-016,1735,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I will get straight into it. The Workers' Party (WP) rejects the amendment proposed by Member Mr Liang Eng Hua Hwa. We have no substantive quarrel with Amendment No 3, which does not substantially change the thrust of our Motion."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01736,2023-11-07-T-016,1736,Pritam Singh,A careful examination of our proposals today would show that they would neither undermine Singapore's fiscal sustainability nor would they unduly burden future generations.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01737,2023-11-07-T-016,1737,Pritam Singh,"However, we disagree with Amendment Nos 1 and 2."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01738,2023-11-07-T-016,1738,Pritam Singh,"Amendment No 1 which states that ""cost of living is a global concern"" reads as an attempt to minify the role Government can and should play to reduce cost of living burdens on Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01739,2023-11-07-T-016,1739,Pritam Singh,"While global factors are important, these should instead prompt a review of existing policies with the view to relieve cost of living pressures."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01740,2023-11-07-T-016,1740,Pritam Singh,"We also disagree with Amendment No 2 and its use of the words ""continue pursuing policies"". The use of the word ""continue"" suggests to us, at least, that the status quo is fine. We disagree. Indeed, we have proposed specific structural changes to the system that we believe will work better than current policies."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01741,2023-11-07-T-016,1741,Pritam Singh,The WP Members of Parliament have made concrete proposals in several areas. We urge the Government to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies to better support Singaporeans and their families during this cost of living crisis.
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01742,2023-11-07-T-016,1742,Pritam Singh,"On the electricity front, Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC, Ms Sylvia Lim observed that the need for Singaporeans to conserve energy is more urgent than ever, given the risks of high prices and supply shortages caused by conflicts around the world. She recounted the Government's answer to managing household electricity bills, was the open electricity market. But the dramatic failures of retailers in 2021 has cast doubt on the viability of the open energy market to bring down household electricity bills. She asked the Government to look again at her earlier suggestion of tiered electricity pricing and to also consider lowering charges for consumption during off-peak hours."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01743,2023-11-07-T-016,1743,Pritam Singh,"Staying on utilities and specifically water prices, my contribution to this debate was my calling on the Government to review the price structure of water for both domestic and non-domestic consumers. Such a review would have the objective of creating a more fairly tiered structure that promotes water conservation and potentially lowest cost for business and many households."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01744,2023-11-07-T-016,1744,Pritam Singh,"Aljunied GRC Member of Parliament, Mr Faisal Manap, reiterated the call he made in 2014 to the Government to establish a means of assessing the effectiveness of our social safety net. Back then, he proposed that Singapore adopt the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s social protection framework. He suggested that if the Government prefers a more localised framework, the Government should then look at the minimum income standard published for households in Singapore, reports that have been published by local academics led by Assoc Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe. The Government is not precluded from publishing its own list of basic needs and those extras required for thriving in Singapore as a way of tracking outcomes for Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01745,2023-11-07-T-016,1745,Pritam Singh,"Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Ms He Ting Ru's speech covered several keynotes in health and the health and care ecosystem where the Government can and should be working harder to control the cost of healthy living in Singapore. Her speech reflects the WP's concern about the effect by increasing cost of care is having on the physical and mental well-being of families and calls for more support in areas like mental healthcare and intermediate and long-term care. For instance, she called for MediSave annual limits to be increased in line with medical inflation."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01746,2023-11-07-T-016,1746,Pritam Singh,"Hougang SMC Member of Parliament, Mr Dennis Tan asked for the current means testing in healthcare to be improved upon to better account for an individual's financial situation and health conditions so that healthcare can be more affordable and accessible. He called for help to be given to more Singaporeans who may need more assistance, even though they may be adjudged not to be eligible based on present household income or annual value of their home, especially when they are not able to receive financial assistance from members of the same household."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01747,2023-11-07-T-016,1747,Pritam Singh,"He called for more help to be extended to adults with special needs or other forms of disability who are in the working adult age group, but who are unable to work and require part-time or full-time care from family members, especially in families where the parents are getting on in age. More help should also be extended to family members responsible for their caregiving."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01748,2023-11-07-T-016,1748,Pritam Singh,"Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Mr Louis Chua reiterated his call for the Government to defer the GST hike in 2024, with even one year being a helpful deferment, especially when the Government has already achieved the revenue increase which the GST hike was meant to bring."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01749,2023-11-07-T-016,1749,Pritam Singh,"On housing, he called for the Government to increase the supply of HDB flats across the for purchase market and also the neglected for rent market, especially as our population growth and housing demand appears to have stepped up. To ensure all Singaporeans can access appropriate housing and shelter, addressing the fundamental demand-supply problem would necessitate adjustments to the supply side of the equation so that the market can find the appropriate equilibrium."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01750,2023-11-07-T-016,1750,Pritam Singh,"On private transport, Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim called for changes to the COE system that would rationalise high prices. He explained why expensive COE affect not just households that may have very legitimate need for cars, such as families with children or the disabled, but also everyone that books a taxi or PHC."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01751,2023-11-07-T-016,1751,Pritam Singh,"He stressed the importance of smoothing out the vehicle quota supply across the years and seizing the practice of reimbursing early deregistered COEs at their book value. He also suggested prohibiting dealers from bidding directly for COEs and treating private hire cars in the same manner as taxis are, which is to have them bid in the open category albeit paying Cat A or Cat B prices."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01752,2023-11-07-T-016,1752,Pritam Singh,"On public transport, Aljunied GRC Member, Mr Gerald Giam called for a National Transport Corporation to be established as a publicly owned non-profit land transport planner and operator of all MRT, LRT and trunk bus services. This will allow the early profits of the current public transport operators to be redirected to benefit commuters by mitigating fair increases and providing free transport for the elderly and people with disabilities. He explained how the NTC could bring about significant productivity gains and economies of scale when compared to the current public transport model."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01753,2023-11-07-T-016,1753,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, some of these proposals by the WP will be revenue-neutral. Others will result in increased expenditures."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01754,2023-11-07-T-016,1754,Pritam Singh,"Sir, at the National Day Rally this year, the Prime Minister shared with the public that the new classification system for HDB flats into Prime, Plus and Standard from the existing mature and non-mature classification, would see the sticker price of an $877,000 5-room BTO flat in Ang Mo Kio, for example, come down."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01755,2023-11-07-T-016,1755,Pritam Singh,"The question is how would this reduction in price come about? Would it be from the Chief Valuer relooking at how land is priced for public housing, or as should be assumed, from an increase in taxpayer subsidies from HDB flats, drawn from the yearly Budget?"
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01756,2023-11-07-T-016,1756,Pritam Singh,"The reality, Mr Speaker, is that the Government will look to lower HDB prices through the deployment of taxpayer dollars. Inevitably, it is a taxpayer that is going to foot the bill for a larger HDB subsidy to make HDB flats cheaper. And this is an amount that the Government believes it can absorb without an increase in taxes. Otherwise, it would not have pursued the new HDB BTO classification system."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01757,2023-11-07-T-016,1757,Pritam Singh,"In the same spirit, Mr Speaker, the WP believes that we should continue to look beyond short-term relief in addressing this cost of living crisis and to relook at prevailing orthodoxies on other schemes so as to lower cost for Singaporeans and their families."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01758,2023-11-07-T-016,1758,Pritam Singh,"A few other proposals will put cash in the hands of vulnerable workers and seniors to help them navigate their way out of this difficult period, for example, by reviewing with a fresh perspective, both MediSave, as well as the Workfare Income Supplement."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01759,2023-11-07-T-016,1759,Pritam Singh,"A few other proposals may prompt behavioural shifts towards greater efforts to reduce wastage and more sensitivity to sustainable usage of utilities, such as water and electricity."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01760,2023-11-07-T-016,1760,Pritam Singh,"At their core, all the proposals prompt the Government to relook at its legacy policy with an eye on battling the cost of living crisis that Singaporeans find themselves deeply mired in."
2023-11-07-T-016-S-01761,2023-11-07-T-016,1761,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, it has been a long day.

2023-11-07-T-018-S-01800,2023-11-07-T-018,1800,Carrie Tan,"Mr Speaker, I would first like to extend my gratitude for Members of the House who are able to stay despite a very long Sitting today and for lending me their presence and attention to this issue."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01801,2023-11-07-T-018,1801,Carrie Tan,"Mr Speaker, a hallmark of this Government's commitment to its people is the Housing and Development Board (HDB) policies and how it aims to meet every Singaporean's housing needs."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01802,2023-11-07-T-018,1802,Carrie Tan,"I am pleased with the recent housing policy announcements that make housing more accessible to more diverse groups of Singaporeans whilst also enhancing the subsidy schemes that strive to make our housing system a fair one. Today, I would like to address our public rental housing and to highlight the potential we have of transforming it and harnessing it to catalyse the social mobility of our lowest income Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01803,2023-11-07-T-018,1803,Carrie Tan,"In recent years, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has taken the step to incorporate and integrate rental flats into build-To-order (BTO) purchase blocks, such as the ones in Marsiling and Bukit Batok. This is a bold move that I support."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01804,2023-11-07-T-018,1804,Carrie Tan,"I know itis not an easy decision, as I am aware that there are pockets of Singaporeans who hold quite contrary views and who are concerned that having rental units within their blocks could cause a devaluation of their flats."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01805,2023-11-07-T-018,1805,Carrie Tan,"Nevertheless, I am glad the Government chose to do the right thing by prioritising social mixing and integration over political popularity. This addresses the larger social good, especially with emerging trends and threats of social polarisation along class lines that our society is facing. All Singaporeans need to support this effort, if we truly believe that each one of us are our brother's keepers."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01806,2023-11-07-T-018,1806,Carrie Tan,"To uplift those struggling with their lives, there is more our public rental housing can do beyond just providing a roof over heads. In my speech today, I make a case for enhancing public rental housing to enable human thriving."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01807,2023-11-07-T-018,1807,Carrie Tan,"In past Parliament Sittings, I sought statistics from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and MND on how long it takes for the average rental housing family to move out to their own purchased flats. The answer is seven years."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01808,2023-11-07-T-018,1808,Carrie Tan,"My hon colleague Ms Mariam Jaafer also sought information on the rate of transition by rental flat families to their own homes in the last five years. The statistics were  36% moved to their own houses in less than five years, 32% in five to 10 years and a good remaining 32% after more than 10 years."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01809,2023-11-07-T-018,1809,Carrie Tan,What if we can improve these statistics by enabling more families to achieve social mobility and home ownership sooner?
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01810,2023-11-07-T-018,1810,Carrie Tan,I invite this House to consider and urge MND to study the role of space and aesthetics in helping rental flat families achieve financial self-sufficiency and social mobility quicker. We can do this by reimagining and redesigning rental flats to help occupants unlock their full potential.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01811,2023-11-07-T-018,1811,Carrie Tan,I invite this House to go on a design thinking journey with me to understand how space and aesthetics in our living environment actually have a profound impact on human functioning and thereby can aid with social mobility.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01812,2023-11-07-T-018,1812,Carrie Tan,"Firstly, on the role of space and well-being. From my conversations with healthcare providers at Woodlands Health Campus and Yishun Health, which we collaborate with in the community, data from our healthcare system shows that lower-income residents tend to be ""frequent flyers"" at hospitals. The phenomenon of 20% of healthcare users taking up the majority of healthcare expenses is not uncommon."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01813,2023-11-07-T-018,1813,Carrie Tan,We can understand that one factor leading to poor health is overcrowding and another is stress. Infections spread easily amongst family members in cramped environments and poor hygiene in common spaces can facilitate disease across households. Poorer health leads to poor employment retention and more frequent school absences.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01814,2023-11-07-T-018,1814,Carrie Tan,MSF is very familiar with these challenges – high rates of employment turnover and disproportionately higher rates of school absenteeism amongst children from rental blocks communities. The common and perplexing challenge many social service agencies face seems to be – how come the poor seem to be less motivated?
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01815,2023-11-07-T-018,1815,Carrie Tan,"If we pause to think about it, might it not be because they are struggling more in their day-to-day lives due to basic, bare-bone and often stressful living conditions which they do not have the resources to improve on their own?"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01816,2023-11-07-T-018,1816,Carrie Tan,"Home becomes a place just to survive but not to thrive in. We under-estimate the amount of energy it takes to overcome challenges inherent in the current rental housing premises, leaving less energy for constructive actions, such as focusing on job performance or school performance."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01817,2023-11-07-T-018,1817,Carrie Tan,"Let us look squarely at just one such challenge observed in our rental estates – overcrowding. It is not uncommon when I do my house visits to come across families with three, four, sometimes five children living in a 2-room flat."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01818,2023-11-07-T-018,1818,Carrie Tan,"Under the current public rental housing scheme, 1- or 2-room flats are the norm and, on a case-by-case and very limited basis, 3-room flats are made available to very large families. The HDB occupancy cap for renting out flats and commercial property does not seem to apply to the Public Rental Scheme and these bring real struggles for the inhabitants."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01819,2023-11-07-T-018,1819,Carrie Tan,"Having people live in insufficient spaces makes it difficult to keep common spaces tidy. Household and personal belongings tend to spill out into common corridors, creating obstruction and potential hazards. These then create tensions with neighbours and among family members, adding on stress from conflict in their day-to-day lives."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01820,2023-11-07-T-018,1820,Carrie Tan,"Many Town Councils and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) regularly receive feedback on fire hazards and end up having to manage neighbourly disputes that are hard to resolve because people simply do not have sufficient space for their daily activities, such as their laundry, their clothes racks, their shoes. Such neighbourly tensions make for very poor quality of life for residents and also create unnecessary toll on public resources."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01821,2023-11-07-T-018,1821,Carrie Tan,"Another important side effect of overcrowding is on children's development. During the COVID-19 pandemic, immense challenges were faced by children in rental flats trying to cope with home-based learning in limited space. In a community collaboration that Nee Soon South had with Yishun Health and SportSG, it was observed by volunteers in a football programme for children from rental block families that the kids had poorer hand-eye coordination and could not throw or catch as well as other kids."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01822,2023-11-07-T-018,1822,Carrie Tan,"We suspect that space constraints had a role in limiting the amount of play within flats, compromising the psychomotor development of children who live in cramped spaces. One can imagine that children living in such tiny flats are very much curtailed in their play. They cannot really throw a ball to their sibling at home without the risk of hitting something or getting yelled at by a frustrated parent. How can we expect children to study, play, learn and grow up well physically, emotionally and mentally in such conditions?"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01823,2023-11-07-T-018,1823,Carrie Tan,"In the latest URA guidelines issued in January 2023, ""the threshold of 70 square meters is a reasonable size for small families."" I would like to ask MND what is the prevailing floor area of 1- and 2-room public rental flats and is there a minimum space per resident that is adhered to that provides for conducive living?"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01824,2023-11-07-T-018,1824,Carrie Tan,"In England, the Building Research Establishment estimates that hazards in poor housing costs the National Health Services in England £1.4 billion a year but that the full societal cost, including long-term mental health, suffering and trauma treatment, is around £18.5 billion per annum."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01825,2023-11-07-T-018,1825,Carrie Tan,I urge MND to work with MSF to do the necessary research into living spaces and their impact on early childhood development outcomes.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01826,2023-11-07-T-018,1826,Carrie Tan,"Next, I would like to talk about the role of aesthetics in human potential. From the earliest philosophers to modern-day psychologists, scholars and researchers have recognised the power of beauty to inspire and motivate us. Research in psychology has shown that exposure to beautiful environments can have a positive impact on our mental health and well-being."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01827,2023-11-07-T-018,1827,Carrie Tan,"For example, a study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that people who worked in aesthetically pleasing environments were more productive and had a greater sense of well-being than those who worked in less aesthetically pleasing environments."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01828,2023-11-07-T-018,1828,Carrie Tan,"Furthermore, aesthetics can also inspire us to be our best selves. Art can help us to see the world in new and different ways, challenging our perspectives and inspiring us to be more empathetic, compassionate and socially responsible."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01829,2023-11-07-T-018,1829,Carrie Tan,"What we can infer logically is that just focusing on objective functionality alone, without considering the value of aesthetics is to miss an opportunity – to inspire and catalyse empathy, compassion and an increased sense of civic responsibility in rental housing communities."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01830,2023-11-07-T-018,1830,Carrie Tan,"If one pays attention, it is not hard to notice that the general cleanliness upkeep in rental estates is much more challenging than those in purchased estates. What is commonly observed are higher rates of high-rise littering, misuse or poor use of common chutes, dirty common corridors and void decks. Most Town Councils share a common challenge in having to deploy more cleaning and maintenance resources in rental block areas."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01831,2023-11-07-T-018,1831,Carrie Tan,I say this not to shame rental block residents but for us to really investigate what the causes and reasons behind such behaviours are. They reveal little willingness or motivation in occupants to help upkeep and maintain common spaces. Is this function simply because of a lack of ownership because the flats do not belong to them?
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01832,2023-11-07-T-018,1832,Carrie Tan,"If that is so, how then do we explain the behavior of much more cooperative behavior when people stay at hotels? We do not own the premises in hotels but we do not also commonly hear of people trashing hotel rooms or littering at hotel lobbies and premises even though the people who stay there are temporary occupants."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01833,2023-11-07-T-018,1833,Carrie Tan,"This begs a deeper examination into the factors contributing to civic behaviour. What common sense tells us is that the common behavior and attitude of people towards places and things that are beautiful and pleasing is that we are naturally inclined to want to keep them that way. As the philosopher Immanuel Kant once aptly said, ""Beauty is a symbol of morality."""
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01834,2023-11-07-T-018,1834,Carrie Tan,"Beauty has the power to evoke and inspire the higher qualities and virtues in human beings. When we are exposed to beauty, we are more likely to feel motivated to pursue our goals with greater determination and to push ourselves to be our best selves."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01835,2023-11-07-T-018,1835,Carrie Tan,My team's research found recent projects in the US that have discovered the tremendous role aesthetics and design play in helping to rehabilitate homeless communities. One of them is the first shelter project in Oregon that uses trauma-informed design by a non-profit called Path Home.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01836,2023-11-07-T-018,1836,Carrie Tan,"Here, Mr Speaker, I would like to show a visual example of what their shelter for the homeless looks like. Permission to show a slide, please."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01837,2023-11-07-T-018,1837,Speaker,Go ahead.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01838,2023-11-07-T-018,1838,Carrie Tan,"Does it not look beautiful? This is a homeless shelter. The founder of Path Home shared in an interview that the design was ""based on research done since the 1960s in hospitals, looking into what kinds of facilities promote better reactions among patients."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01839,2023-11-07-T-018,1839,Carrie Tan,"""Some of the key elements they’ve identified include having a connection to nature – lots of light, real plants indoors and outdoors – and building with natural materials, so they used a lot of real wood. The color palette is also very calming – lots of greens and turquoises from the ocean."""
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01840,2023-11-07-T-018,1840,Carrie Tan,"The founder also said, ""It’s about helping families feel worthy (so) that they can get up and do the hard work to get their lives back on track."""
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01841,2023-11-07-T-018,1841,Carrie Tan,This project has had much success and positive feedback from its inhabitants. It demonstrates the role of aesthetics in uplifting the human spirit and catalysing human motivation.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01842,2023-11-07-T-018,1842,Carrie Tan,"We under-estimate just how being able to have something beautiful can uplift an individual's sense of self-esteem and fundamentally shift their self-perception and motivation. We see the same principle across many makeover TV shows across different cultures, TV shows where a makeover has the power to change someone's life by changing how they perceive themselves."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01843,2023-11-07-T-018,1843,Carrie Tan,There is also a global architecture firm called the Workplace Group at HOK that has created a landmark guidebook on trauma-informed design with the goal of helping people to quiet the part of the brain that stays in survival mode.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01844,2023-11-07-T-018,1844,Carrie Tan,"Research has shown that the positive emotional effect of the aesthetic experience affects mood and indirectly promotes health and well-being. These benefits include improvement of memory, lower stress levels and increased social connection."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01845,2023-11-07-T-018,1845,Carrie Tan,"By using design to enhance living spaces with aesthetics, colours, lighting and art, instead of inhabitants coming home feeling fearful and on high alert from a difficult day, chronically operating on flight or fight mode, they can be more relaxed when they return home, which has proven to improve executive functioning. This can help them focus better on actions like applying for jobs or getting their children to school."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01846,2023-11-07-T-018,1846,Carrie Tan,"Given the availability of such information and knowledge on how space and aesthetics can help improve human performance, we would be doing a disservice if the Government does not start incorporating such principles in the way we design public rental housing."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01847,2023-11-07-T-018,1847,Carrie Tan,"The prevailing approach that provides only a basic and functional roof over people's heads needs to change. This belief, long held by too many in the system, that providing a pleasing and comfortable environment for public rental housing residents might demotivate them from working hard to move out, also really needs to change. These are limiting beliefs that curtail the possibilities and potential of our own citizens who are striving hard to improve their lives."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01848,2023-11-07-T-018,1848,Carrie Tan,"We can do more for the Singaporeans who need our utmost support to help them overcome the adversities in their lives. And having aesthetically pleasing homes, with just sufficient space for inhabitants to participate in daily activities stress-free, is akin to having an ever-present cheerleader that one can come home to everyday."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01849,2023-11-07-T-018,1849,Carrie Tan,"Instead of assuming and blaming lack of personal motivation for poor social mobility outcomes, let us take a more scientific and proactive approach to study the environmental factors that we can enhance to improve human motivation and potential."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01850,2023-11-07-T-018,1850,Carrie Tan,"I recognise that in these fiscally challenging times, cost is always a consideration. Instead of increasing costs, there are ways we can rethink the design and construction of rental housing to optimise the value of expenditure we are already planning to spend on rental housing provision."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01851,2023-11-07-T-018,1851,Carrie Tan,"Furthermore, any incremental costs could have a disproportionate positive return in terms of wellbeing and savings in longer-term healthcare and welfare spending. The long-term gains may well outweigh the short-term incremental costs."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01852,2023-11-07-T-018,1852,Carrie Tan,"Architects and design thinkers know full well how design influences and shapes human behaviour. We must recognise the importance of space and beauty in our lives and strive to create environments that inspire and enable human thriving. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of our rental housing families and give them that much more – a better starting point to recover and thrive from their adversities."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01853,2023-11-07-T-018,1853,Carrie Tan,"The Government does not need to do this alone. There are philanthropists and now, many family offices we can tap on to do this with. I urge MND to partner with the philanthropic and private sectors, to get sponsorships and to work with arts groups, Design Singapore, local artists, designers, developers and volunteers to create uplifting designs and furnishings in rental living spaces."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01854,2023-11-07-T-018,1854,Carrie Tan,"The co-living pilot refurbished from the old Anderson Junior College hostel was well intended but implementation fell too far short. MND launched this in March and I believe it is not too late to still harness this opportunity to pilot such partnerships for the transformation to redesign and rethink our rental housing approach. We can do better, so let us do it together."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01855,2023-11-07-T-018,1855,Speaker,Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01856,2023-11-07-T-018,1856,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Ms Tan for her passionate speech on enhancing the living environment to motivate, empower and uplift public rental households."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01857,2023-11-07-T-018,1857,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We share Ms Tan's belief in the power and social impact of good design. As the master planner and developer of Singapore's public housing estates, HDB appreciates the importance of quality homes and environments that enhance residents' wellbeing and support Singaporeans to lead their best lives."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01858,2023-11-07-T-018,1858,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"To that end, HDB launched its ""Designing for Life"" roadmap in 2020. The roadmap seeks to enhance residents' physical, mental and social well-being through thoughtful, resident-centred design, for example, by bringing nature and greenery closer to residents, improving facilities for active living and providing ample community spaces to encourage social connections."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01859,2023-11-07-T-018,1859,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Rental flats are always built as part of a wider HDB neighbourhood. This means that rental tenants enjoy the same communal facilities and amenities as sold flat owners, including community living rooms, roof gardens, fitness facilities, playgrounds, neighbourhood shops, preschool centres and Active Ageing Centres."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01860,2023-11-07-T-018,1860,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Over the years, we have made progressive improvements to our rental flats to enhance their design and provide a better living environment for our tenants. Rental blocks that were built since 2007 are better designed with enhanced natural lighting and ventilation within units and at the corridors. These newer blocks are very different from the older rental blocks that have long corridors with units lined on both sides."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01861,2023-11-07-T-018,1861,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In addition, we have been building public rental flats alongside sold flats – in the same projects and, since 2014, in the same blocks and on the same floors. In integrated blocks such as those at Marsiling Greenview and West Plains @ Bukit Batok, public rental flats look no different from sold flats from the outside. On the inside, they have similar finishes and fittings as 2-room Flexi sold flats."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01862,2023-11-07-T-018,1862,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,We do this because having a good social mix is a key objective of our public housing programme.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01863,2023-11-07-T-018,1863,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"After the first integrated block was completed at Marsiling Greenview, we commissioned a study with the National University of Singapore to understand the impact of this integrated design. We found that the design features have encouraged interactions and ties between owners and tenants, for example, by locating sold flats and rental flats on the same floor, minimising visible differences between sold flats, and rental flats and having shared amenities such as playgrounds."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01864,2023-11-07-T-018,1864,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The study also found that owners and tenants have the same perceptions of what constitutes a liveable environment and they act in similar ways to uphold these standards, for example, in terms of upkeeping shared corridor spaces and managing cleanliness."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01865,2023-11-07-T-018,1865,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We are encouraged by these findings and will apply these learnings to the design of future integrated blocks. Another 17 integrated blocks will be completed in the next five years and we will continue to build them, including in future Prime and Plus projects."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01866,2023-11-07-T-018,1866,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We also explore new typologies to improve the living environment for public rental tenants. For example, we announced earlier, as shared by Ms Tan, that we are piloting a new public rental typology for singles called the Single Room Shared Facilities (SRSF). The SRSF aims to give tenants greater privacy while providing shared facilities to prevent social isolation. Each tenant will have their own private bedroom that comes with basic furnishings such as a bedframe, table and wardrobe. Amenities like toilets, kitchens, dining areas and laundry rooms will be shared to ensure that we make good use of the space and to facilitate social interaction."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01867,2023-11-07-T-018,1867,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For older public rental blocks, HDB keeps them in good condition through regular maintenance and upgrading. Older rental blocks will typically be upgraded together with sold blocks when the entire area is rejuvenated through HDB's various upgrading programmes. We are also progressively redeveloping older clusters of rental flats. Tenants who are relocated can move to newer rental flats with improved designs."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01868,2023-11-07-T-018,1868,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,We empathise with Ms Tan's point about providing a good living environment for rental families with young children. We have been making efforts in this area and will seek to further improve the design of flats.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01869,2023-11-07-T-018,1869,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Under the Public Rental Scheme, HDB generally offers 1- and 2-room flats to cater to both singles and families. The vast majority of our public rental households – more than nine in 10 – have four or fewer persons. We do not have a hard space norm per person but we recognise that some larger households may have space concerns and have already started some efforts to help provide a better environment for families with young children, including using good design to overcome the constraints of land and space. Families with at least three members will be allocated a 2-room public rental flat. These are typically sized similarly to 2-room Flexi sold flats."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01870,2023-11-07-T-018,1870,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In recent years, HDB has also started building 2-room rental flats that come with an additional partitioned space. The space can be used as a child's room with a single bed and a small wardrobe, or as a study or activity room to support children's development."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01871,2023-11-07-T-018,1871,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For larger families, those able to form two family nuclei will be allocated two public rental flats. Where possible, HDB strives to ensure that both flats are located near each other to facilitate mutual care and support. HDB also works with MSF to offer 3-room public rental flats to selected large families with children on a case-by-case basis."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01872,2023-11-07-T-018,1872,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Like Ms Tan, we are driven by the desire to see families achieving social mobility and seniors ageing well even if they live in public rental. But to achieve these, hardware alone is insufficient. We need to pair hardware with good social support and programming to make concerted efforts to address households' needs and aspirations holistically."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01873,2023-11-07-T-018,1873,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For example, HDB works with relevant people sector partners to support seniors in public rental flats with active ageing programmes and assisted living services."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01874,2023-11-07-T-018,1874,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"At a rental block in Kebun Baru, the Integrated Dementia Assisted Living project by Dementia Singapore offers a telehealth room, community kitchen and social programming to support seniors living in the rental block to age well in place."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01875,2023-11-07-T-018,1875,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For families with young children living in public rental flats, Government agencies and community partners work closely together through the ComLink+ programme to provide coordinated support. ComLink officers and Family Coaches will journey with families, understand their needs and aspirations and work with them to develop goals and action plans. Different agencies and partners then work together backend, behind the scenes, to support families' individual needs – the Ministry of Education for school subsidies, the Ministry of Health for healthcare, Family Service Centres for family counselling, community-based after-school care and programmes for children, and so on."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01876,2023-11-07-T-018,1876,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In Boon Lay, for example, children in ComLink+ families may spend their after-school hours at the Tak Takut Kids Club. The club is operated by 3Pumpkins, a community-based organisation. Located at the ground floor of a rental block, it runs various free play, sports and crafts activities, and provides a safe and supportive environment where children can grow and express themselves."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01877,2023-11-07-T-018,1877,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In November last year, we worked with MSF to launch the ComLink Rental Scheme to strengthen our efforts and go further upstream. Once families apply for a public rental flat and are assessed to be eligible, they will automatically be enrolled in ComLink+. A ComLink officer will then proactively reach out to them to offer support even before they move into their rental flat and continue to journey with them as they work towards achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01878,2023-11-07-T-018,1878,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"To date, over 700 families have been engaged under this scheme. When public rental families achieve stability and build up their finances, we support them on their journey towards homeownership."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01879,2023-11-07-T-018,1879,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,I have met many rental families and I know that many of them hope to buy their own flats. Families can count on our full support.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01880,2023-11-07-T-018,1880,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We provide substantial housing grants for lower-income families on top of the significant subsidies that we provide for all BTO flats. First-timers can tap on the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant and receive up to $80,000 while second-timers can tap on the $15,000 Step-Up CPF Housing Grant."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01881,2023-11-07-T-018,1881,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We also have the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, which helps second-timer families with young children living in public rental flats to own a home again. The design of this scheme embodies the idea of social empowerment – coupling strong support from the Government and the community, with commitment and hard work from families. We enhanced the scheme recently to offer 3-room flats on shorter leases so that families have more housing options and increased the grant amount from $35,000 to $50,000."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01882,2023-11-07-T-018,1882,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"There is also a dedicated Home ownership Support Team at HDB, who will provide one-to-one guidance to tenants on their homebuying journey. The team will share practical tips and advice on their housing budget and options and guide families through the process of flat selection, application and booking."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01883,2023-11-07-T-018,1883,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The team has reached out to about 1,500 households over the past three years. Mr Khairi and Mdm Dayang is one of them. Together with their five children —"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01884,2023-11-07-T-018,1884,Speaker,"Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, you have a minute left. Just to let you know."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01885,2023-11-07-T-018,1885,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Together with their five children,"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01886,2023-11-07-T-018,1886,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In conclusion, Sir, supporting and uplifting those who are more vulnerable among us requires a holistic approach. We pay attention to the design of our homes and living environments and we go one step further, to pair hardware with software, and marshal resources from across Government and society to support families."
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01887,2023-11-07-T-018,1887,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,We welcome the people and private sectors to contribute your ideas and resources too and work with us to uplift families in public rental flats.
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01888,2023-11-07-T-018,1888,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01889,2023-11-07-T-018,1889,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."" (proc text)]"
2023-11-07-T-018-S-01890,2023-11-07-T-018,1890,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Adjourned accordingly at 10.13 pm.
2023-11-07-T-019-S-01891,2023-11-07-T-019,1891,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Education in light of the UK's decision to replace the A- and T-levels with a single Advanced British Standard qualification (a) whether the Ministry plans to review the format of the GCE A-levels to better cater to broader-based educational requirements; (b) whether there are plans to evolve the A-level syllabus away from meeting university entrance requirements toward non-academic subjects; and (c) whether the separate A-levels, polytechnic diploma and NITEC tracks remain the most suitable for the Singapore context."
2023-11-07-T-019-S-01892,2023-11-07-T-019,1892,Chan Chun Sing,"Our education system offers multiple pathways to cater to our students' diverse strengths, interests and learning needs. At the post-Secondary level, junior colleges and the Millenia Institute equip students with the necessary academic skills and knowledge through the A-Level syllabus as required for further education, particularly at the universities. On the other hand, polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education provide more industry-based and applied learning that prepares students for the workforce. These different pathways continue to be relevant today."
2023-11-07-T-019-S-01893,2023-11-07-T-019,1893,Chan Chun Sing,"We will continue to offer multiple post-Secondary pathways, even as we enhance porosity between the pathways. For example, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has increased the opportunities for polytechnic graduates to further their studies at the universities, especially with more applied university programmes. Since 2020, A-Level graduates have also been able to take polytechnic diploma courses with exemptions of up to two semesters."
2023-11-07-T-019-S-01894,2023-11-07-T-019,1894,Chan Chun Sing,"We regularly review and make adjustments across all our pathways to ensure that our students receive a holistic education beyond academic preparation, and that our education system prepares them well for the future. For example, to keep pace with technological and global developments, MOE has announced that we will be enhancing the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) framework, with a greater emphasis on adaptive and inventive thinking, communication and civic literacy."
2023-11-07-T-020-S-01895,2023-11-07-T-020,1895,Keith Chua,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether there are plans to expand the range of institutions and organisations currently available to advise new Family Offices on their philanthropic endeavours; and (b) whether such plans will include the establishment of platforms for the social services, education, healthcare, arts, heritage and sports sectors to present grant proposals to Family Offices."
2023-11-07-T-020-S-01896,2023-11-07-T-020,1896,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There are many organisations and platforms that new Family Offices (FOs) can tap on to inform and shape their philanthropic endeavours. These include the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS), Community Chest, as well as groups such as the Asia Philanthropy Circle and Asian Venture Philanthropy Network. In March, the Wealth Management Institute and the Private Banking Industry Group, supported by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), launched the Impact Philanthropy Partnership to bring together high net worth individuals and FOs to galvanise giving and encourage philanthropic partnerships. These organisations and communities can help new FOs better understand our local giving ecosystem and how they can contribute."
2023-11-07-T-020-S-01897,2023-11-07-T-020,1897,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our approach is to work with intermediaries that already have touchpoints and connections with FOs, to raise awareness of philanthropic causes and practices and encourage meaningful and impactful philanthropy. For example, Government agencies such as the Economic Development Board and MAS, as well as intermediaries, such as financial institutions with wealth management services, law firms and tax advisory services connect interested donors with CFS. CFS then matches donors with impactful giving opportunities across different sectors – social and welfare, education, health, arts and heritage, sports, and so on – depending on the donors' interests."
2023-11-07-T-020-S-01898,2023-11-07-T-020,1898,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As more FOs set up in Singapore, the Government will continue to monitor and review the philanthropic advisory support available to enable them to channel their capital and other resources towards meaningful philanthropic purposes, to make a positive impact on society."
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01899,2023-11-07-T-021,1899,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether a fixed timeline can be set for the Police to complete investigations in respect of offences where the accused persons are denied bail.
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01900,2023-11-07-T-021,1900,K Shanmugam,"We have considered what the Member suggested. However, it is not practical to prescribe fixed timelines by which the Police must complete investigations."
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01901,2023-11-07-T-021,1901,K Shanmugam,"The time the Police require for investigations depends on many factors, including the nature of the offence and the complexity of the case."
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01902,2023-11-07-T-021,1902,K Shanmugam,"It is more important that they undertake robust investigations, as long or as short a time as they may need, to get to the truth of the case."
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01903,2023-11-07-T-021,1903,K Shanmugam,"That said, for cases where the accused persons are remanded, the Police closely monitor investigation timelines and processes and expedite investigations to the extent feasible. Where appropriate, we have also used technology to try to reduce the number of accused persons who have to be remanded in the first place, for example, through the use of electronic tagging to mitigate flight risks, instead of objecting to bail."
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01904,2023-11-07-T-021,1904,K Shanmugam,"We have also taken steps to make it easier for accused persons to meet bail conditions, for example, in certain cases, releasing on reduced bail quantum if the accused is on electronic tagging. We are also considering amending the law to allow personal bonds in more cases."
2023-11-07-T-021-S-01905,2023-11-07-T-021,1905,K Shanmugam,"It is, however, a fact that our Police investigators are increasingly overworked. In particular, in the last few years, there has been an exponential rise in the number of scam and cybercrime cases and in the number of people arrested for such cases. We have been working to get approval for more manpower resources for them so that their tempo of work is more sustainable, and with more investigators, cases may move faster too."
2023-11-07-T-022-S-01906,2023-11-07-T-022,1906,Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for National Development whether there will be a review of the penalties imposed on real estate agents who market or sell HDB flats that do not fulfil the minimum occupation period, such as to make the fine comparable to the commission potentially gained from selling such flats or to include other non-financial deterrent penalties."
2023-11-07-T-022-S-01907,2023-11-07-T-022,1907,Desmond Lee,"The Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) takes a serious view of errant behaviour by property agents and has strengthened its disciplinary framework when the amendments to the Estate Agents Act came into force on 30 July 2021. The maximum financial penalty that CEA's Disciplinary Committee (DC) may impose on errant agents for serious disciplinary breaches was raised from $75,000 to $100,000."
2023-11-07-T-022-S-01908,2023-11-07-T-022,1908,Desmond Lee,"When determining the appropriate penalties to be meted out, the DC considers all relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the potential commission earned, the extent of the agent's culpability and whether there are other aggravating or mitigating factors."
2023-11-07-T-022-S-01909,2023-11-07-T-022,1909,Desmond Lee,"For property agents who breach HDB's minimum occupation period (MOP) rules when facilitating HDB property transactions for their clients, the DC not only censures and imposes financial penalties on the agents, but also suspends the agents' registrations. This is a strong deterrent, as the agents cannot earn any commission since they are not allowed to conduct estate agency work when suspended."
2023-11-07-T-022-S-01910,2023-11-07-T-022,1910,Desmond Lee,CEA has no plans to review the penalties for breaches of MOP rules at this juncture.
2023-11-07-T-023-S-01911,2023-11-07-T-023,1911,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there are plans to boost the availability of carbon credits for companies in Singapore; (b) what guidelines and rules are being established to ensure transparency and uphold public accountability of these carbon credits; and (c) what measures are in place to independently ascertain the veracity and integrity of forest conservation carbon credits.
2023-11-07-T-023-S-01912,2023-11-07-T-023,1912,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore is catalysing the development of credible carbon markets. Singapore actively co-facilitated Article 6 negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change conferences and participates in initiatives, such as the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative to promote harmonisation of rules and standards."
2023-11-07-T-023-S-01913,2023-11-07-T-023,1913,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are actively fostering partnerships in international carbon credits (ICCs) and have signed Memoranda of Understanding with more than 10 countries. Of these, Singapore has substantively concluded negotiations on government-to-government implementation agreements with Ghana and Vietnam, while negotiating with several other countries. Companies can source for ICCs from these host countries to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 1 January 2024."
2023-11-07-T-023-S-01914,2023-11-07-T-023,1914,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore is committed to ensuring the environmental integrity of ICCs that companies can use to offset their carbon tax liabilities. In October 2023, we published the eligibility criteria which requires ICCs to comply with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and meet seven internationally recognised principles to demonstrate that they are of high environmental integrity. Later this year, we will publish a list of eligible host countries, carbon crediting programmes and methodologies that adhere to Singapore's ICC eligibility criteria."
2023-11-07-T-023-S-01915,2023-11-07-T-023,1915,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Environment Agency has signed Memoranda of Understanding with five carbon crediting programmes to leverage on their assessments, expertise and capabilities. These carbon crediting programmes have established due diligence processes, including the use of independent, accredited third party verifiers to monitor, report and verify the integrity of ICCs. This provides assurance that ICCs issued under their registries and used to offset taxable emissions are robustly validated, verified, issued and retired."
2023-11-07-T-024-S-01916,2023-11-07-T-024,1916,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider (i) increasing the quantum of rebates on the Morning Pre-Peak Fares and (ii) reinstating the free morning pre-peak hour travel scheme so as to reduce peak-hour crowds while enabling commuters to cope with the upcoming public transport fare increases and, if not, why not."
2023-11-07-T-024-S-01917,2023-11-07-T-024,1917,Chee Hong Tat,"Since December 2017, commuters who tap in at any train station before 7.45 am on weekdays, excluding Public Holidays, enjoy a discount of up to 50 cents on their train journey. The objective of this initiative, which costs about $40 million per year, and equivalent to about 2% of fare revenue collected, is to reduce crowding at peak times."
2023-11-07-T-024-S-01918,2023-11-07-T-024,1918,Chee Hong Tat,"To ensure public transport remains affordable, the Government provides more than $2 billion per year to subsidise public transport operating costs, and will be providing an additional $300 million to defer the bulk of the fare increase this year. Concessionary fares of up to 70% discount are available to one in two Singaporeans, including seniors and students. On top of this, we also provide Public Transport Vouchers to lower-income households."
2023-11-07-T-024-S-01919,2023-11-07-T-024,1919,Chee Hong Tat,"Lowering pre-peak fares further will have to be made up for through the fares paid by all commuters travelling later in the day, including those who cannot change their work hours and those making the return commute home. Therefore, the Member's suggestions of increasing the pre-peak discount or offering free pre-peak travel will require other commuters to pay higher fares."
2023-11-07-T-025-S-01920,2023-11-07-T-025,1920,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a manpower crunch for critical healthcare roles within the hospitals in Singapore, for example radiographers and pharmacists; (b) if so, what are the reasons behind the crunch; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to meet the manpower needs in these areas."
2023-11-07-T-025-S-01921,2023-11-07-T-025,1921,Ong Ye Kung,"In general, with an ageing population and higher patient load post COVID-19 pandemic, there is a general healthcare capacity crunch around the world, including in Singapore. It is both in terms of physical facilities, like hospital beds and stepdown care and also manpower, including nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals."
2023-11-07-T-025-S-01922,2023-11-07-T-025,1922,Ong Ye Kung,"To overcome manpower shortages, the Ministry implements a range of measures. This includes expanding our local training pipelines, introducing recruitment incentives, keeping remuneration competitive to reduce attrition, developing upgrading pathways for in-service staff or mid-careerists and augmenting our workforce with suitable foreign manpower, as well as redesigning healthcare job roles to make the work more meaningful. To improve working conditions in our public healthcare institutions, we have adopted a zero-tolerance approach towards harassment and abuse and implemented measures to improve staff well-being."
2023-11-07-T-026-S-01923,2023-11-07-T-026,1923,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many cases of fraud relating to the issuance of bizSAFE certificates for workplace safety and health capabilities have been detected in the past five years; (b) whether there is a trend in the number of such fraud cases; and (c) what are the Ministry's plans to detect and prevent such cases.
2023-11-07-T-026-S-01924,2023-11-07-T-026,1924,Tan See Leng,There is only one incident that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) have encountered involving the forgery of bizSAFE certificates over the past five years. This case is currently under Police investigation.
2023-11-07-T-026-S-01925,2023-11-07-T-026,1925,Tan See Leng,"MOM and WSHC take a serious view of any misrepresentation or fraud involving our programmes, which may mislead the public, the companies involved and their clients, as well as undermine the standards of workplace safety and health."
2023-11-07-T-026-S-01926,2023-11-07-T-026,1926,Tan See Leng,"WSHC had issued a bulletin to alert companies that they should verify their bizSAFE status through the WSHC's official bizSAFE portal. This portal is the sole authoritative source of information on bizSAFE status. If companies notice any discrepancies, they should immediately contact the WSHC for further verification."
2023-11-07-T-027-S-01927,2023-11-07-T-027,1927,Don Wee,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the Commissioner of Charities requires all charitable organisations or fund raisers which are accorded the Institution of Public Character (IPC) status to list their top donors in their annual returns; and (b) how many charitable organisations with IPC status have filed their annual returns for FY2022."
2023-11-07-T-027-S-01928,2023-11-07-T-027,1928,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) are not required to disclose a list of their top donors in their annual submissions to the Commissioner of Charities (COC). However, all donations received and expended by the IPCs must be accounted for within their Financial Statements. Other information such as the IPCs' programmes and activities must be reported in their Annual Report."
2023-11-07-T-027-S-01929,2023-11-07-T-027,1929,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Out of the total number of IPCs required to file their annual submissions with the COC for the Financial Year ended in 2022, about 98% have submitted their returns. The COC's office is following up with the remaining IPCs."
2023-11-07-T-028-S-01930,2023-11-07-T-028,1930,Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the current percentage of students in mainstream primary and secondary schools who have been diagnosed with special education needs; and (b) how have the teachers and such students been coping with the alternative assessment arrangements.
2023-11-07-T-028-S-01931,2023-11-07-T-028,1931,Chan Chun Sing,"Today, 6.9% of students in mainstream primary and secondary schools, or around 27,000 students, are reported to have Special Educational Needs (SEN)."
2023-11-07-T-028-S-01932,2023-11-07-T-028,1932,Chan Chun Sing,"Depending on the severity of needs, students with SEN may be granted Access Arrangements (AA) when they sit for examinations. The provisions help to reduce barriers for students with SEN to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, so that they can be fairly assessed. Examples of AA include the provision of extra time, use of assistive technology, and exemption from specific components of an examination."
2023-11-07-T-028-S-01933,2023-11-07-T-028,1933,Chan Chun Sing,"The Ministry of Education and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board work closely with schools, parents, medical and/or allied health professionals to monitor and review the students' needs. Schools also use school-based assessments to check if the AA are appropriate in addressing specific barriers faced by students. Schools observe that students with SEN are able to make use of these provisions to better access their examinations."
2023-11-07-T-029-S-01934,2023-11-07-T-029,1934,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what steps will be taken to investigate the potential poisoning of dogs at a field in Parry Avenue; and (b) whether the findings of the investigations will be made public.
2023-11-07-T-029-S-01935,2023-11-07-T-029,1935,Desmond Lee,"Investigations into the deaths of dogs that have been said to be linked to a field at Parry Avenue are ongoing. The National Parks Board (NParks) worked with agencies, such as Singapore Land Authority and NEA, to collect environmental samples and monitor the situation at the field and its surrounding areas. NParks has also spoken to the affected dog owners and attending veterinarians to gather relevant medical, environmental and epidemiological information on the case. In addition, NParks has reached out to veterinarians, as well as dog owners living around Parry Avenue, for any report of similar cases. To date, NParks has not received any such report."
2023-11-07-T-029-S-01936,2023-11-07-T-029,1936,Desmond Lee,We understand that this is a difficult time for the affected dog owners and aim to complete investigations as soon as possible. The findings will be shared with the public when ready.
2023-11-07-T-030-S-01937,2023-11-07-T-030,1937,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how quickly are families under the ComCare scheme removed from the scheme after their family members have entered employment; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider monitoring the families for a longer period to ensure that financial and job security have been achieved before removing them from the scheme.
2023-11-07-T-030-S-01938,2023-11-07-T-030,1938,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Applicants apply for temporary financial assistance under ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA). If approved, they are provided SMTA for typically three to six months. Even if they obtain employment during the period of assistance, we continue to provide SMTA for the approved period. SMTA can be renewed, if the family continues to require temporary assistance even after its members obtain employment."
2023-11-07-T-030-S-01939,2023-11-07-T-030,1939,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In providing social assistance, we should remember that families have agency and are in the best position to know when they need assistance. A significant proportion of families who cease SMTA, find their feet and are self-reliant. This is testament to the strength and resilience of Singaporeans. These families do not expect the Government to continue monitoring whether they still require ComCare assistance."
2023-11-07-T-031-S-01940,2023-11-07-T-031,1940,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will review the existing Weekend Car, Off-Peak Car and Revised Off-Peak Car schemes and introduce more off-peak car scheme options with additional benefits."
2023-11-07-T-031-S-01941,2023-11-07-T-031,1941,Chee Hong Tat,"The Weekend Car Scheme, launched in 1991, aimed to make car ownership more affordable for those who do not need to use their cars during peak hours. In the current version since 2010, the Revised Off-Peak Car Scheme (ROPC) allows owners to use the vehicles for the full day on Saturdays, Sundays, Public Holidays and on the eve of five Public Holidays."
2023-11-07-T-031-S-01942,2023-11-07-T-031,1942,Chee Hong Tat,"Car ownership is but one part of our land transport system. Singaporeans will continue to enjoy a more extensive and better-connected public transport network over time. For those who still wish to own a car and use it generally during off-peak periods, the ROPC remains a viable alternative. We will continue to conduct regular reviews of the ROPC scheme and introduce more options, if necessary, to meet the transport needs of Singaporeans."
2023-11-07-T-032-S-01943,2023-11-07-T-032,1943,Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the expected overall performance of Singapore’s economy in 2023; and (b) what are some of the key areas that will determine the growth prognosis of Singapore's economy in 2024.
2023-11-07-T-032-S-01944,2023-11-07-T-032,1944,Gan Kim Yong,The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) expects GDP growth for the full year to come in within the official forecast range of 0.5% to 1.5%.
2023-11-07-T-032-S-01945,2023-11-07-T-032,1945,Gan Kim Yong,"Looking ahead to 2024, GDP growth is likely to pick up modestly on the back of sustained growth in our tourism- and aviation-related sectors, as well as a gradual turnaround in the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, there are significant uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy. These include the risks of more persistent-than-expected inflation in the advanced economies, as well as escalations in the Israel-Hamas conflict, the war in Ukraine and geopolitical tensions among major global powers."
2023-11-07-T-032-S-01946,2023-11-07-T-032,1946,Gan Kim Yong,MTI will announce the GDP growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024 later this month.
2023-11-07-T-033-S-01947,2023-11-07-T-033,1947,He Ting Ru,asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the proposed guidelines for insurers to adopt fair and responsible practices towards persons with disabilities (PWDs) and those with mental health conditions; (b) whether the proposed guidelines will prohibit the denial of health insurance to individuals on the basis of their disabilities or mental health conditions; and (c) when will Singapore withdraw the reservation placed on Article 25(e) of the UN Convention on the Rights of PWDs which prohibits discrimination against PWDs in the provision of health insurance.
2023-11-07-T-033-S-01948,2023-11-07-T-033,1948,Lawrence Wong,"Singapore supports the principle of non-discriminatory treatment towards persons with disabilities. Accordingly, it is the Government's intention to withdraw the reservation placed on Article 25(e) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
2023-11-07-T-033-S-01949,2023-11-07-T-033,1949,Lawrence Wong,"In December 2022, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a consultation paper on guidelines for financial institutions on fair practices towards customers, including those with disabilities and mental health conditions. Under the proposed guidelines, MAS made it clear that insurers should not indiscriminately reject an application solely based on declared personal information, such as a disability or medical condition, including a mental health condition. Instead, insurers are expected to carry out an objective assessment of every application based on reliable information or data relevant to the risks being insured."
2023-11-07-T-033-S-01950,2023-11-07-T-033,1950,Lawrence Wong,"However, insurers are not prohibited from declining applications, setting higher premiums or applying appropriate conditions in view of the risks presented by an applicant. For health insurance, insurers assess risks based on a customer's medical history, health condition and health risks arising from any known conditions. Having a robust assessment framework is fundamental to the long-term sustainability of an insurer's business."
2023-11-07-T-033-S-01951,2023-11-07-T-033,1951,Lawrence Wong,"MAS is carefully considering the feedback received on the proposed guidelines. We intend to finalise and issue the guidelines by mid-2024, and thereafter, will work towards withdrawing the reservation placed on Article 25(e) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
2023-11-07-T-034-S-01952,2023-11-07-T-034,1952,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there is noticeable progress in curbing the population of crows at heartland town centres; and (b) whether there is research conducted on developing more effective measures to reduce the infestation of crows in Singapore.
2023-11-07-T-034-S-01953,2023-11-07-T-034,1953,Desmond Lee,"Over the past few years, the  National Parks Board (NParks)"
2023-11-07-T-034-S-01954,2023-11-07-T-034,1954,Desmond Lee,"For example, NParks has ramped up its islandwide efforts to trap and remove crows and to regularly survey and remove crow nests in trees. NParks also advises Town Councils (TCs) to remove crow nests, where needed."
2023-11-07-T-034-S-01955,2023-11-07-T-034,1955,Desmond Lee,"In heartland town centres, bird-feeding and human-generated food sources are key drivers of crow concentration and population growth. To address these, NParks works with the Singapore Food Agency, National Environment Agency and TCs to raise public awareness on the negative impacts of bird-feeding. NParks also conducts surveillance and enforcement against such acts and partners agencies and TCs to improve estate cleanliness and encourage proper food waste management by residents and food establishments. These measures have helped to address the presence of crows in affected areas."
2023-11-07-T-034-S-01956,2023-11-07-T-034,1956,Desmond Lee,"As part of its science- and community-based approach to managing the crow population, NParks will continue to undertake research to improve its crow management measures, such as through studies on crow ecology, trapping methods and dispersal strategies. For example, NParks recently completed a study on ways to enhance crow trapping efficacy. All of us can also continue to play our part, by not feeding crows and keeping our environment clean."
2023-11-07-T-035-S-01957,2023-11-07-T-035,1957,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how does the Ministry ensure that appropriate measures have been taken to protect vulnerable residents, including the elderly and those with respiratory issues, from the impact of the haze; and (b) whether there are updates on the Ministry's discussions and cooperation among countries in the region which are experiencing hot spots to reduce haze pollution under the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution."
2023-11-07-T-035-S-01958,2023-11-07-T-035,1958,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Environmental Agency (NEA) works with other Government agencies through the Haze Task Force to develop and implement plans to manage the impact of haze on Singapore. The Haze Task Force convened in April prior to the start of the haze season and again on 7 October 2023, when the air quality in some regions of Singapore exceeded PSI 100 and entered the Unhealthy range. Following the October meeting, NEA began publishing daily haze advisories up until 24 October 2023. This provided the public with timely information to plan their activities and safeguard the health and well-being of themselves and their loved ones."
2023-11-07-T-035-S-01959,2023-11-07-T-035,1959,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Specific advice was provided to the elderly, pregnant women, children and persons with chronic lung or heart disease. The public was also advised to refer to the 1-hour PM2.5 levels and personal guide when deciding on immediate activities. In the event of a severe haze episode, when the 24-hour PSI exceeds 200, the People's Association, together with relevant agencies, will distribute N95 masks to lower-income and vulnerable residents. So far, this year, we did not need to activate such distributions."
2023-11-07-T-035-S-01960,2023-11-07-T-035,1960,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"All classrooms of primary and secondary schools, MOE Kindergartens, and Special Education schools are equipped with air purifiers to enhance the well-being of students during a haze episode. Preschools are similarly required to ensure sufficient air purifiers to accommodate children in the event of haze."
2023-11-07-T-035-S-01961,2023-11-07-T-035,1961,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised medical practitioners on how to manage and treat patients with haze-related conditions, such as asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. MOH has also worked with healthcare institutions, including public hospitals, polyclinics and nursing homes, to put in place haze preparedness measures to deal with any increase in the number of patients with haze-related medical conditions and ensure that they have adequate air-purifying equipment and medical supplies."
2023-11-07-T-035-S-01962,2023-11-07-T-035,1962,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"At the regional level, the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), hosted by Meteorological Service Singapore, continues to support ASEAN member states by providing regular assessments of the regional haze situation, daily hotspot information and early warnings of transboundary haze. The ASMC also presents its forecasts and assessments at annual ASEAN haze meetings, such as the Conference of Parties to the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATHP). At the 18th Conference of Parties to the AATHP, which convened in Vientiane on 24 August 2023, ASEAN countries concluded an agreement to establish the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Transboundary Haze Pollution Control in Indonesia, which will work with the ASMC to strengthen the region's capabilities in dealing with hotspots and transboundary haze."
2023-11-07-T-036-S-01963,2023-11-07-T-036,1963,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health whether the mental health situation in Singapore can be a factor for consideration whether or not to grant work passes to trained foreign nationals who would like to work in Singapore to offer treatment and services to the community but may not meet quota or salary requirements for applicable passes.
2023-11-07-T-036-S-01964,2023-11-07-T-036,1964,Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Manpower provides more work passes on flexible criteria for sectors facing urgent needs, in consultation with the relevant agencies, such as in healthcare, where demand cannot be fully filled by our local workforce. These healthcare professionals are also required to meet the standards for practice in Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-036-S-01965,2023-11-07-T-036,1965,Ong Ye Kung,"Beyond hiring more manpower to support mental health services, we need to strengthen support in the community by tapping on frontline personnel and volunteers, as well as building up the competencies of existing service providers to better care for persons with mental health needs. That is why we have introduced the Tiered Care Model under the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy to better organise mental health services across the health and social sectors, according to the severity of individuals' mental health needs. This will lay the foundation for further strategic enhancements to the mental health ecosystem and improve access to care."
2023-11-07-T-037-S-01966,2023-11-07-T-037,1966,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there are plans to review, rejuvenate and revitalise ActiveSG Jurong West Sports Stadium by offering a wider selection of food and beverage and retail options to further enhance the vibrancy and visitorship of the premises."
2023-11-07-T-037-S-01967,2023-11-07-T-037,1967,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"SportSG plans the rejuvenation of all our sport centres based on factors, such as age, expected period to redevelopment and alignment to town development plans, to ensure that they continue to serve residents' needs well. Jurong West Sport Centre is not yet due for a rejuvenation."
2023-11-07-T-037-S-01968,2023-11-07-T-037,1968,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Currently, the majority of Jurong West Sport Centre's spaces are leased to childcare centres and enrichment schools, with the remaining spaces not equipped with the exhaust and electrical provisions required to support food and beverage (F&B) operations. SportSG has introduced F&B vending machines at the centre to offer more options for visitors and there are F&B and retail options nearby, such as Nanyang neighbourhood centre, Pioneer Mall, Joo Koon MRT, the recently reopened Jurong West Hawker Centre and the upcoming BTO at Jurong West Street 93."
2023-11-07-T-037-S-01969,2023-11-07-T-037,1969,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"When Jurong West Sport Centre is due for rejuvenation, we will explore enhancing its infrastructure to support more F&B options. SportSG will continue to work with partners in the neighbourhood to enhance the vibrancy and visitorship of Jurong West Sport Centre."
2023-11-07-T-038-S-01970,2023-11-07-T-038,1970,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether any code of conduct or best practice contract terms exist for firms or companies that lease vehicles to vocational drivers or riders; (b) since 2021, how many complaints have been received regarding allegations that such contractual terms are misleading, onerous, or unconscionable and what recourse is available; and (c) whether the market concentration of such leasing firms or companies is a possible cause for such complaints."
2023-11-07-T-038-S-01971,2023-11-07-T-038,1971,See Jinli Jean,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider setting up a dedicated, low-cost dispute resolution platform to facilitate the resolution of leasing disputes between vehicle leasing firms and vocational drivers or riders who are concerned about unfair vehicle leasing terms being invoked against them."
2023-11-07-T-038-S-01972,2023-11-07-T-038,1972,Gan Kim Yong,"Vehicle leasing terms are commercial agreements between vehicle leasing firms and vocational drivers or riders. Based on vehicle registration records, there are over a thousand fleet owners in the point-to-point passenger transport rental market. The vehicle leasing firms offer different packages and contracts which cater to the different needs and preferences of drivers and riders. If disputes arise, aside from legal recourse through the courts, affected parties could consider lower-cost dispute resolution channels, such as mediation services offered by the Singapore Mediation Centre."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01973,2023-11-07-T-039,1973,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what was the average productivity gain achieved by the public transport operators over each of the previous five years; and (b) what was the Network Capacity Factor, as set out in the previous fare adjustment formula, for the period since the previous Fare Review Exercise; and (c) where did the productivity gain mostly come from for this current Fare Review Exercise."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01974,2023-11-07-T-039,1974,Chee Hong Tat,"The Public Transport Council (PTC) reviewed the fare adjustment formula and mechanism in April this year. As explained by the PTC and in this House, the new formula accounts for productivity and network capacity differently. Mr Giam's questions on past productivity gains and the Network Capacity Factor (NCF), pertain to the old fare formula, which is not meaningful in the current context."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01975,2023-11-07-T-039,1975,Chee Hong Tat,"On productivity, the PTC has reaffirmed the role played by operators in ensuring that our public transport system is cost-efficient and this is reflected in both the previous and current fare formulas."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01976,2023-11-07-T-039,1976,Chee Hong Tat,"The previous formula included a Productivity Extraction, which shared half of operators' actual productivity gains over the previous five years, measured by growth in value added per employee, with commuters. As outlined in the PTC's Fare Adjustment Formula and Mechanism Review Report available on its website, there were exceptional circumstances during the last five years, which had an impact on productivity. During the pandemic, there was a sharp drop in public transport ridership, which has yet to fully recover. This resulted in lower fare revenue and significant losses for the operators, as well as productivity losses. Based on the previous formula, the Productivity Extraction would have been set at 0% and commuters would not benefit from a lower fare adjustment quantum."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01977,2023-11-07-T-039,1977,Chee Hong Tat,"Hence, the PTC recommended to replace the Productivity Extraction with a Productivity Contribution, set at 0.1% in the new formula, which is at the same level as the Productivity Extraction applied for the preceding five-year period. This sets the expectation for operators to improve productivity, which in turn reduces the fare adjustment quantum for commuters."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01978,2023-11-07-T-039,1978,Chee Hong Tat,"On capacity, the new formula includes a Capacity Adjustment Factor, based on the smoothened growth rate in public transport capacity, fixed at 1.1% for five years, from 2023 to 2027. This replaced the NCF in the previous formula."
2023-11-07-T-039-S-01979,2023-11-07-T-039,1979,Chee Hong Tat,"The NCF was intended to track cost movements due to changes in public transport capacity, relative to changes in commuter demand. In its first three years, the NCF ranged from 1.6% to 3.9%. However, the NCF was not designed for exceptional situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when ridership fell sharply and the NCF spiked to 50% in 2021. As such, the NCF was suspended from the onset of the pandemic and has now been replaced by the fixed Capacity Adjustment Factor."
2023-11-07-T-040-S-01980,2023-11-07-T-040,1980,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the existing number of migrant worker dormitories is sufficient to accommodate the number of migrant workers in the construction sector currently.
2023-11-07-T-040-S-01981,2023-11-07-T-040,1981,Tan See Leng,"As mentioned in response to several recent Parliamentary Questions, such as those filed by Members of Parliament Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Louis Chua at the 3 July and 4 August 2023 Parliament Sittings, we have been seeing strong demand for dormitory beds. This remains the situation today and is due to employers hiring more migrant workers as the economy recovers from COVID-19. The number of migrant workers in the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sectors is now about 120% of the number in 2019."
2023-11-07-T-040-S-01982,2023-11-07-T-040,1982,Tan See Leng,"The Government continues to work with the dormitory industry to increase dormitory bed supply. For large-scale construction projects, Construction Temporary Quarters are being used to house workers where feasible."
2023-11-07-T-040-S-01983,2023-11-07-T-040,1983,Tan See Leng,"As migrant worker numbers cannot keep rising, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) urges employers to adopt productivity measures to reduce their reliance on foreign workers and to consider their ability to house their workers before taking on new projects. MOM also reminds employers to ensure housing has been secured for their workers before they enter Singapore. Since 19 September 2023, employers in the CMP sectors must provide proof of acceptable accommodation before they are allowed to bring their workers into Singapore."
2023-11-07-T-041-S-01984,2023-11-07-T-041,1984,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the criteria for the return of a child to his or her family after being placed in a place of safety or foster home.
2023-11-07-T-041-S-01985,2023-11-07-T-041,1985,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,A child in alternative care will be returned to their family only after safety and risk concerns have been addressed through interventions and the family has shown positive progress towards reunification.
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01986,2023-11-07-T-042,1986,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether he can provide details of the review of (i) firefighting procedures (ii) operational safety (iii) equipping and training that SCDF undertook, following the death of the late SCDF NSF SGT1 Edward Go on 8 December 2022 in a firefighting operation; and (b) what steps have been taken to enhance the safety of officers, particularly NSF officers, in the performance of high-risk duties."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01987,2023-11-07-T-042,1987,K Shanmugam,"Following the incident on 8 December 2022, SCDF convened an Internal Review Group (IRG) to conduct a detailed After-Action Review (AAR) into the firefighting operation that day. The AAR covered SCDF's firefighting procedures, operational safety, equipping and training."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01988,2023-11-07-T-042,1988,K Shanmugam,"As part of the AAR, the IRG also audited over 260 firefighting operations in 2021 and 2022, where at least one firefighting water jet was deployed. The aim was to assess whether the operations were conducted professionally and safely and whether adequate command and control was exercised by the commanders on the ground. The IRG further scrutinised 61 of these cases that required more than two firefighting water jets, that is, more challenging incidents."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01989,2023-11-07-T-042,1989,K Shanmugam,"The audit found that while the operations had largely been conducted competently and safely, there were occasional individual lapses such as officers not wearing their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) properly, or not using the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) during damping down operations."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01990,2023-11-07-T-042,1990,K Shanmugam,The IRG made recommendations to improve operational safety as well as command-and-control.
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01991,2023-11-07-T-042,1991,K Shanmugam,"Establishing a Staging and Breathing Apparatus Control Officer (BACO) control point for all residential unit fires has been implemented since 18 September 2023. The control point helps ground commanders to track the deployment of firefighters, as well as to check on the PPE of the teams before they are sent into the scene of the fire. Previously, this control point was only established for major fire incidents."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01992,2023-11-07-T-042,1992,K Shanmugam,"Issuance of Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) to all Section Commanders, which will be achieved by March 2024. Currently, only officers who are holding the appointment of Deputy Rota Commander and higher are issued with BWCs. The wider deployment of BWCs will enhance the quality of post-incident AARs. By mid-2024, when the camera is capable of livestreaming to the SCDF Operations Centre, it will also enhance sensemaking during ongoing incidents."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01993,2023-11-07-T-042,1993,K Shanmugam,"A new generation of breathing apparatus with telemetry capabilities will be progressively deployed from mid-2024. This project was initiated two years ago, and has been in development. When introduced in 2024, it will enable transmission of the data of the air capacity remaining in a firefighter's breathing apparatus to the BACO control point for monitoring. This next-generation breathing apparatus will also come with a Personnel Distress Device (PDD) that is automatically activated once the air tank is turned on, as compared to the existing PDD, which must be manually turned on by the firefighter. With the new PDD, after a period when the firefighter is motionless, the PDD will automatically trigger an alert to the BACO control point, so that officers there can make appropriate interventions."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01994,2023-11-07-T-042,1994,K Shanmugam,"Enhancements to the selection process for ground commanders. The SCDF is also conducting a comprehensive review of the training of ground commanders, including enhancements to the training syllabus to underline the importance of command responsibility and introducing exercises to stress-test the command-and-control capabilities of the commanders."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01995,2023-11-07-T-042,1995,K Shanmugam,"Mr Murali also asked about the deployment of Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs), in particular, as firefighters and how we ensure their safety. First, only NSFs who are certified to be medically fit and are of Physical Employment Status ‘A’, ‘B1’ or ‘B2’, will be deployed as firefighters."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01996,2023-11-07-T-042,1996,K Shanmugam,"Second, firefighting training at the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) is conducted with ‘live' fire simulators to provide realism so that trainees, regardless whether they are Regulars or NSFs, can gain relevant experience operating in conditions that closely resemble real fires. The training curriculum is reviewed regularly to ensure currency and robustness."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01997,2023-11-07-T-042,1997,K Shanmugam,"Even after graduation from CDA, training continues to be an integral part of a firefighter's daily routine. They undergo exercises and drills during each shift to familiarise themselves with their respective roles and functions, as well as to maintain individual fitness and other competencies. Annual proficiency tests are conducted by CDA to ensure that their skills and fitness levels continue to meet the required standards."
2023-11-07-T-042-S-01998,2023-11-07-T-042,1998,K Shanmugam,"The safety of all SCDF personnel, whether they are Regulars, NSFs, NSmen or Volunteers, is of paramount importance to us. We will continue to make sure that they are well-trained and properly equipped to carry out their duties, safely and effectively."
2023-11-07-T-043-S-01999,2023-11-07-T-043,1999,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government tracks wealth inequality in Singapore; (b) if so, what indicators are used to track wealth inequality; and (c) whether there is data on these indicators over the last 10 years."
2023-11-07-T-043-S-02000,2023-11-07-T-043,2000,Lawrence Wong,"Wealth is difficult to track comprehensively as it takes many different forms, including assets that are not publicly traded and thus, difficult to value. In addition, financial wealth is highly mobile across borders and bank deposit data is protected by the Banking Secrecy Act. For these reasons, the Government is not able to measure and track wealth inequality accurately."
2023-11-07-T-043-S-02001,2023-11-07-T-043,2001,Lawrence Wong,"Nevertheless, we have been proactively putting measures in place to address wealth inequality. This includes wealth taxes in the form of stamp duties, property tax and the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for motor vehicles. Over the years, we have made these taxes more progressive. For example, we introduced higher marginal Buyer's Stamp Duty rates for higher-value properties in Budget 2023 and raised property tax rates for all non-owner-occupied residential properties and higher-value owner-occupied residential properties in Budget 2022. We also raised the ARF for higher-end cars in Budget 2022 and 2023."
2023-11-07-T-043-S-02002,2023-11-07-T-043,2002,Lawrence Wong,"We invest in and support Singaporeans in the essential areas of education, jobs, housing and retirement, to help them secure good jobs and accumulate wealth over their lifetime. For instance, our CPF system enables Singaporeans to grow their savings, with higher interest rates for lower balances and additional government support to the lower-income, through schemes like Workfare and the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme. Housing subsidies also provide the less well-off with more support to own a home. Our investments and support in these areas position all Singaporeans to be part of the country's growth, regardless of their backgrounds, with more support for those with less."
2023-11-07-T-044-S-02003,2023-11-07-T-044,2003,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB is aware of the maintenance issues relating to car parks with interlocking tiles; and (b) whether HDB will cease installation of interlocking tiles for future HDB projects.
2023-11-07-T-044-S-02004,2023-11-07-T-044,2004,Desmond Lee,"The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has been using interlocking paving blocks at precinct driveways for more than 30 years. As compared to other road surfaces made of asphalt or concrete, interlocking paving blocks provide greater ease of access to underground services for maintenance and repairs, and are easier to reinstate when works are completed. They are also more environmentally friendly as they are made from recyclable materials."
2023-11-07-T-044-S-02005,2023-11-07-T-044,2005,Desmond Lee,"Maintenance issues associated with interlocking paving blocks include loosening, dislodgement and unevenness of the blocks. These issues are likely caused by heavy usage in areas with high traffic flow, inconsistent workmanship, use of non-standard paving blocks and improper repair and reinstatement works."
2023-11-07-T-044-S-02006,2023-11-07-T-044,2006,Desmond Lee,"In 2022, HDB reviewed the use of interlocking paving blocks to enhance the design, material selection, construction control and ease of maintenance of the blocks. For high traffic areas in new HDB developments, such as refuse collection points, drop-off porches, loading and unloading bays and car park entrances, HDB will provide concrete pavements. HDB will continue to use interlocking paving blocks for other areas where it is suitable to do so."
2023-11-07-T-045-S-02007,2023-11-07-T-045,2007,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider requiring all private clinics and hospitals to routinely update patient records on the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system; (b) what are the key challenges that are hindering the mandatory submission of patient records by private clinics and hospitals into the system; and (c) whether there is a timeline or plan for the mandatory participation of private healthcare providers in the NEHR system to achieve the goal of a comprehensive integration of healthcare records.
2023-11-07-T-045-S-02008,2023-11-07-T-045,2008,Ong Ye Kung,"As announced earlier, the Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to table the Health Information Bill to Parliament in the coming months, to mandate the contribution of key selected health information by licensed healthcare providers to the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR). If it passes, from end 2025, MOH will phase-in the requirement for licensed healthcare providers to start submitting to NEHR."
2023-11-07-T-045-S-02009,2023-11-07-T-045,2009,Ong Ye Kung,"A perennial obstacle to mandate contribution to NEHR has been that private healthcare providers do not have NEHR-compatible IT system. MOH has rolled out the Early Contribution Incentive scheme since December 2022, which provides one-time funding support to licensees to defray the cost of upgrading and integrating their IT system with the NEHR."
2023-11-07-T-046-S-02010,2023-11-07-T-046,2010,Sylvia Lim,asked the Prime Minister (a) which retail banks in Singapore have phased out hardware tokens for customers; and (b) whether the Monetary Authority of Singapore will mandate that this option be available to customers to enhance the security of online banking.
2023-11-07-T-046-S-02011,2023-11-07-T-046,2011,Lawrence Wong,"Most major retail banks in Singapore already offer hardware tokens for customers. These include the three local banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB, as well as foreign banks like Maybank and HSBC. Although these banks do not provide hardware tokens by default, bank customers can request for a hardware token if it better meets their needs. There is therefore no need for MAS to mandate that hardware tokens be made available to bank customers as an option."
2023-11-07-T-046-S-02012,2023-11-07-T-046,2012,Lawrence Wong,"Hardware tokens are not a panacea. While hardware tokens that generate one-time passwords (OTPs) are resistant to malware-enabled scams, they are still susceptible to phishing tactics deployed by scammers. There have been many instances where victims were tricked into sharing the OTPs generated by their hardware tokens with scammers who in turn, used them to perform fraudulent transactions."
2023-11-07-T-046-S-02013,2023-11-07-T-046,2013,Lawrence Wong,MAS has been working closely with the industry to continuously strengthen the security of online banking. MAS has also asked the banks to assess and implement customer authentication mechanisms that are more resistant to both phishing and malware attacks.
2023-11-07-T-047-S-02014,2023-11-07-T-047,2014,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Employers of Record (EORs) that serve as an employer for tax purposes while their employees perform work at a different company currently operate in Singapore; (b) how many Singaporeans are currently employed by EORs; and (c) whether such Singaporean workers are considered independent contractors and are entitled to employee benefits under the Employment Act.
2023-11-07-T-047-S-02015,2023-11-07-T-047,2015,Tan See Leng,"We do not track the number of Employers of Record in Singapore, nor the number of Singaporeans employed under them. A worker who is employed by an Employer of Record (EOR) is considered an employee as long as there is a contract of service between the worker and the EOR and they are accorded the entitlements under the Employment Act. This applies even though the workers perform work for the EOR's client."
2023-11-07-T-047-S-02016,2023-11-07-T-047,2016,Tan See Leng,Workers who believe that they have not been accorded their entitlements under the Employment Act may approach the Ministry of Manpower for assistance.
2023-11-07-T-048-S-02017,2023-11-07-T-048,2017,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the utilisation rate of Seletar Airport as measured by (i) passenger throughput (ii) runway utilisation and (iii) gate utilisation vis-à-vis its capacity on these measures; and (b) whether the Ministry is looking to increase the airport's utilisation by attracting more commercial airlines, including budget airlines, to use the airport."
2023-11-07-T-048-S-02018,2023-11-07-T-048,2018,Chee Hong Tat,Traffic at Seletar Airport has surpassed pre-COVID levels. Runway utilisation is also near capacity. There are no plans to attract more commercial airlines to use the airport.
2023-11-07-T-049-S-02019,2023-11-07-T-049,2019,Hazel Poa,"asked the Minister for Education whether students in Government, Government-aided and independent schools, such as (i) students on the Integrated Programme who wish to sit for GCE O-level examinations and (ii) students who wish to register for subjects not offered by their schools, are allowed to register for GCE O-level examinations as private candidates."
2023-11-07-T-049-S-02020,2023-11-07-T-049,2020,Chan Chun Sing,"Students in Government, Government-aided, independent and specialised schools are not allowed to register for the GCE O-Level examinations as private candidates, as they will already register as school candidates. However, schools have the discretion to register students as school candidates for the O-Level examinations in subjects not offered by the school. Schools exercise this option judiciously and consider the overall curriculum and assessment load, aspirations and well-being of their students."
2023-11-07-T-049-S-02021,2023-11-07-T-049,2021,Chan Chun Sing,"For students in the Integrated Programme (IP), we encourage them to pursue broader learning experiences using the time freed up from preparing for the O-Level examinations. They are allowed to take the O-Level examination as school candidates in some instances, such as to fulfil the national policy on mother tongue language, if they are in the Third Language Programme or in the Art/Music Elective Programmes. Beyond this, allowing IP students to take the O-Level examinations as private candidates would go against the intent of the Integrated Programme."
2023-11-07-T-050-S-02022,2023-11-07-T-050,2022,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Manpower in view of the recent staff lay-offs by a regional food delivery provider (a) whether the Ministry will work with the unions and the affected company to assist impacted staff to find jobs; and (b) whether there will be help to direct them to the relevant Government agencies for other forms of assistance.
2023-11-07-T-050-S-02023,2023-11-07-T-050,2023,Tan See Leng,"The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) works closely with various stakeholders, including tripartite partners, to support workers who are laid off. After employers notify MOM of any retrenchments, the Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, which comprises representatives from MOM, Workforce Singapore, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute and Enterprise Singapore, will reach out to the affected workers via their employers and offer them career matching services. This includes providing information kits on career resources, employment facilitation services and Government support for financial assistance if required. Information on Government schemes that provide financial support in areas, such as basic living expenses, housing instalments and school fees will be shared; and the taskforce can also help to direct affected workers who require support to the relevant Government agencies. For unionised workers, employers will normally notify the union before the retrenchment exercise and work closely with them to assist the affected workers in areas, such as employment facilitation, training and quantum of retrenchment benefit."
2023-11-07-T-051-S-02024,2023-11-07-T-051,2024,See Jinli Jean,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry classifies the self-employed person's income as variable income in the computation of HDB home loan; and (b) if so, whether the Ministry will consider reviewing this classification for self-employed persons with demonstrated track record of continual and recurring work for more than three continuous years in sectors that are freelance-work dominated, such as coaching."
2023-11-07-T-051-S-02025,2023-11-07-T-051,2025,Desmond Lee,"In assessing applications for an HDB housing loan, HDB considers various factors, such as job stability, CPF contributions and monthly cash savings. HDB then applies a set of mortgage financing guidelines, such as a maximum loan tenure of 25 years, loan-to-value limit of 80%, maximum mortgage servicing ratio of 30% and interest rate floor of 3.0% per annum to ensure prudent borrowing."
2023-11-07-T-051-S-02026,2023-11-07-T-051,2026,Desmond Lee,"In computing the eligible HDB housing loan amount, HDB considers all income derived from employment or trade, excluding bonuses, over a 12-month assessment period. This assessment approach is consistently applied across all applicants, regardless of whether they are self-employed or not, including those whose incomes fluctuate from month to month."
2023-11-07-T-052-S-02027,2023-11-07-T-052,2027,Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry is considering a review of the availability and suitability of programmes to identify and support seniors who may be experiencing mental health issues, including those who may be reluctant to accept support."
2023-11-07-T-052-S-02028,2023-11-07-T-052,2028,Ong Ye Kung,"The Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being recently launched Singapore's National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, following a comprehensive review of cross-cutting issues requiring multi- and inter-agency efforts to tighten the nexus between healthcare interventions and social support for various population segments."
2023-11-07-T-052-S-02029,2023-11-07-T-052,2029,Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) had worked with the Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to establish 68 Community Outreach Teams (CREST) that raise awareness on mental health and identify individuals, including seniors, with mental health needs and provide basic emotional support and service linkages to other parts of the ecosystem according to their needs. Active Ageing Centres (AACs) are community nodes for seniors and if the AAC staff come across seniors with mental health needs, they too will refer such cases to CREST teams."
2023-11-07-T-052-S-02030,2023-11-07-T-052,2030,Ong Ye Kung,"We understand that some seniors experiencing mental health issues may be reluctant to seek help or accept support due to stigma. Should the Silver Generation Ambassadors come across these seniors during their home visits, they would share about mental health resources in the community and encourage them to seek help."
2023-11-07-T-053-S-02031,2023-11-07-T-053,2031,Don Wee,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what is the expected impact of the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the Singapore economy.
2023-11-07-T-053-S-02032,2023-11-07-T-053,2032,Lawrence Wong,"This question was addressed in the reply to the Motion for “Solidarity, Security and Peace – The Israel-Hamas Conflict” on the Order Paper for 6 November 2023. ["
2023-11-07-T-054-S-02033,2023-11-07-T-054,2033,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Transport following a meeting between the Ministry, trade associations and NGOs in October 2023, whether an update can be provided on the possibility of a timeline to ban the transportation of workers on the back of lorries."
2023-11-07-T-054-S-02034,2023-11-07-T-054,2034,Chee Hong Tat,"As stated in our previous response, the Government is committed to improving safety for all road users. We are working together with relevant stakeholders, including the industry and the civil society, to develop practical solutions. We will provide further updates when ready."
2023-11-07-T-055-S-02035,2023-11-07-T-055,2035,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry since the Grab-Uber merger in 2018 which was found to be anti-competitive on Singapore's ride hailing market (a) whether the Government has data on the merger's impact on Grab's (i) market share (ii) fares (iii) driver earnings and (iv) quality of service; (b) whether the financial penalties and measures imposed in 2018 were sufficient to overcome the anti-competitive impacts; and (c) if not, whether the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore will consider taking any further action and, if not, why not."
2023-11-07-T-055-S-02036,2023-11-07-T-055,2036,Gan Kim Yong,"In 2018, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) imposed directions on Grab and Uber to reduce the anti-competitive impact of their merger, as Grab's market share had increased post-merger. CCCS's directions required Grab to maintain its pre-merger pricing and product options and remove exclusivity obligations imposed by Grab and Uber on drivers and taxi fleets. Other ride-hail platforms, including Gojek, Ryde and TADA, have since entered the market, reducing Grab's market share."
2023-11-07-T-055-S-02037,2023-11-07-T-055,2037,Gan Kim Yong,"In 2020, the Point-to-Point Transport Regulatory Framework was introduced by LTA. The new regulation mandated that licensed operators, including Grab, cannot prevent their drivers from driving for other operators. With the sectoral regulatory framework in place, CCCS released the directions imposed on Grab. CCCS will continue to work closely with the Land Transport Authority and the Public Transport Council to ensure that the Point-to-Point Transport sector remains open and contestable."
2023-11-07-T-056-S-02038,2023-11-07-T-056,2038,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current proportion of non-domestic water consumers who consume (i) potable water (ii) more than 40 cubic metres of potable water per month and (iii) non-potable water, such as NEWater and industrial water; and (b) in 2022, what is the total consumption of potable and non-potable water per day by non-domestic water consumers."
2023-11-07-T-056-S-02039,2023-11-07-T-056,2039,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Non-domestic water users refer to those beyond households and comprise various industries, commercial buildings, schools, community centres, and so on. In 2022, the total consumption of potable and non-potable water by non-domestic water users is around 360 million cubic metres, which is about half of Singapore's total water consumption. Potable water constitutes about half of the water consumed by non-domestic water users, with the remaining half of water needs met by NEWater and industrial water."
2023-11-07-T-056-S-02040,2023-11-07-T-056,2040,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"About 25% of non-domestic water users consume more than 40 cubic metres of potable water per month. This is dependent on the scale of their operations and reflects the nature of their businesses, such as food establishments and manufacturing."
2023-11-07-T-057-S-02041,2023-11-07-T-057,2041,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Tripartite Workgroup formed to develop the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) will introduce FWAs tailored to lower-wage frontline and blue-collar workers to allow time-off for caregiving and upskilling; (b) what measures are in place to ensure that employers support FWAs without hindering the job security or career progression of such workers; and (c) whether there is a framework in development to recognise and reward employers who embrace and implement FWAs for their blue-collar workforce.
2023-11-07-T-057-S-02042,2023-11-07-T-057,2042,Tan See Leng,The Tripartite Workgroup for the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (TG-FWAR) is currently discussing what the scope of the Guidelines should be.
2023-11-07-T-057-S-02043,2023-11-07-T-057,2043,Tan See Leng,"We recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs). The size of a firm, the nature of its business and jobs and the needs of different workers can vary widely. There is also a variety of FWAs that could be implemented, depending on the needs of businesses and the workers. For example, while telecommuting may not be suitable for frontline workers, other arrangements, such as flexible-shift scheduling and staggered hours may be implemented."
2023-11-07-T-057-S-02044,2023-11-07-T-057,2044,Tan See Leng,"Hence, providing FWAs should not be overly prescriptive for employers as they would know how to optimally balance the needs of their business with those of their employees, whether it is to support caregiving or upskilling. We are mindful to not take a rigid approach, which may affect workers' employability and firms' productivity. Instead, we want to build up a norm where employers and employees can discuss constructively what kinds of FWAs work best for them. The Tripartite Guidelines will lay out how employers can assess FWA requests fairly and require them to do so. At the same time, it will also lay out how FWAs should be used responsibly by employees. Employers should also manage and appraise employees on FWAs fairly, in line with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices."
2023-11-07-T-057-S-02045,2023-11-07-T-057,2045,Tan See Leng,"With a tight labour market, it is in employers' best interests to offer the right FWAs that allow them to maintain productivity while attracting and retaining talent. We also recognise employers that adopt FWAs through the Tripartite Standard on FWAs and the Tripartite Alliance Awards. For example, 12 firms were recognised just last week in 2023's Tripartite Alliance Awards for their efforts to support work-life harmony, including through implementing FWAs. The Workgroup will discuss how to further profile progressive employers with FWAs and promulgate their best practices."
2023-11-07-T-058-S-02046,2023-11-07-T-058,2046,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Prime Minister in light of the recent disruption to banking digital services for DBS and Citibank on 14 October 2023 (a) what are the lessons which can be learned from the outage; and (b) whether the Government will be taking any action to ensure that similar disruptions will not recur or will be minimised in the future.
2023-11-07-T-058-S-02047,2023-11-07-T-058,2047,Lawrence Wong,This question has been answered in my reply to the Parliamentary Questions related to banking services disruption filed for 6 November 2023's Sitting.
2023-11-07-T-059-S-02048,2023-11-07-T-059,2048,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health what actions have been taken to ensure that mental health professionals are fully equipped to address the unique challenges such as gender dysphoria, bullying and familial rejection faced by LGBTQ individuals who seek mental health counselling."
2023-11-07-T-059-S-02049,2023-11-07-T-059,2049,Ong Ye Kung,"Our mental health professionals need to be able to manage patients who are struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity, in a clinically appropriate and also sensitive way. In this regard, the Ministry of Health has put in place two key measures to support mental health professionals."
2023-11-07-T-059-S-02050,2023-11-07-T-059,2050,Ong Ye Kung,"Firstly, education and training. For example, psychiatrists-in-training undergo residency teachings and discussions and clinical training that enable them to practise effectively as psychiatrists and care for a wide spectrum of persons needing care. This includes patients who might identify as LGBT and are diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria or other mental health co-morbidities such as Mood Disorders."
2023-11-07-T-059-S-02051,2023-11-07-T-059,2051,Ong Ye Kung,"Secondly, we have developed a set of best practice guidelines for professionals working with such individuals. These guidelines have been developed for Counsellors and relevant professionals working with youth on sexual orientation issues. The last update was 2015 and we are in the process of updating it further, in consultation with relevant professionals in the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, Counselling and Social Work."
2023-11-07-T-060-S-02052,2023-11-07-T-060,2052,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of how the Government takes into account socio-psychological needs for ComCare calculations (a) what is the source of the discrepancy between the Minimum Income Standard of $6,426 for a family with two children as published in the Minimum Income Standards Report 2023 and the ComCare Long-Term Assistance of $1,930 for a four-person household; and (b) how much of the discrepancy is due to differences in (i) the composition of the consumption basket used (ii) prices of components in the basket and (iii) household composition and consumption needs."
2023-11-07-T-060-S-02053,2023-11-07-T-060,2053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) study's estimates include more than the basic needs, which ComCare is meant to support. The Government issued a public statement on 14 September 2023 on the limitations of the MIS study and the Member can refer to the statement for further details."
2023-11-07-T-061-S-02054,2023-11-07-T-061,2054,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will consider increasing the priority given to owed employees' wages or salaries during the winding up of a company; and (b) whether the Ministry is reviewing the $13,000 cap on owed employees' wages and salaries prescribed under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Maximum Amount Payable in Priority) Order 2020."
2023-11-07-T-061-S-02055,2023-11-07-T-061,2055,Tan See Leng,"The Government fully recognises the importance of employees' claims on wages or salaries in the event of their employer winding up. Such claims are already given priority above all other unsecured debts. They are behind only the costs and expenses of winding up, which are necessary for the winding up to proceed smoothly."
2023-11-07-T-061-S-02056,2023-11-07-T-061,2056,Tan See Leng,We will review the cap as part of our regular policy reviews.
2023-11-07-T-062-S-02057,2023-11-07-T-062,2057,Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry regarding the Residential Demand Response (R-DR) pilot programme which empowers households equipped with smart meters to reduce electricity consumption during demand peaks in the power system (a) when are the peak demand periods; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider lowering electricity prices during off-peak periods to better smoothen energy usage in households throughout the day.
2023-11-07-T-062-S-02058,2023-11-07-T-062,2058,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore's electricity consumption patterns have been reasonably consistent over the years. Demand typically peaks in the afternoons and overall demand is higher during the warmer months of each year in April, May and June."
2023-11-07-T-062-S-02059,2023-11-07-T-062,2059,Gan Kim Yong,Reducing peak demand during the day can lower wholesale electricity prices during peak periods by avoiding the need to operate less-efficient and more expensive generation units.
2023-11-07-T-062-S-02060,2023-11-07-T-062,2060,Gan Kim Yong,"Time-Of-Use contracts charge lower electricity prices during off-peak periods. For residential consumers, they can already choose to subscribe to such contracts offered by licensed retailers."
2023-11-07-T-062-S-02061,2023-11-07-T-062,2061,Gan Kim Yong,"The Energy Market Authority (EMA)'s Demand Response (DR) programme also seeks to facilitate reduction in peak demand. Under the DR Programme, commercial and industrial consumers offer to reduce their loads when overall demand is high, in return for incentive payments. For households, EMA and SP Group intend to pilot the Residential Demand Response (R-DR) programme in the second half of 2024, to similarly offer an incentive when these households voluntarily reduce their electricity usage during peak demand periods."
2023-11-07-T-063-S-02062,2023-11-07-T-063,2062,Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the current anti-money laundering measures in Singapore will result in a delay in the opening of bank accounts for companies; and (b) if so, how will such delays affect Singapore's reputation as having an efficient business environment."
2023-11-07-T-063-S-02063,2023-11-07-T-063,2063,Lawrence Wong,"Singapore's reputation as a trusted financial centre is what makes us an attractive place for investments and business. Therefore, our goal to provide a conducive and competitive environment for legitimate businesses must be matched with an equal resolve to prevent bad actors from abusing our system and tarnishing our reputation."
2023-11-07-T-063-S-02064,2023-11-07-T-063,2064,Lawrence Wong,"To mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing, MAS requires banks to conduct customer due diligence before an account can be opened. This includes understanding the purpose of the account and ascertaining the ultimate beneficial owners of companies. These requirements are not new and are aligned with practices in other reputable jurisdictions, as well as standards set by the Financial Action Task Force. They help banks gain a better understanding of the risk profile and needs of their customers, thereby enabling them to not just manage the business relationship in a risk-appropriate manner but also serve their customers better."
2023-11-07-T-063-S-02065,2023-11-07-T-063,2065,Lawrence Wong,Banks have established customer engagement processes to obtain the information needed for account opening. Businesses applying for bank accounts can help in this process by providing sufficient information and timely clarifications to questions posed by banks. The due diligence process should not result in undue delays if banks receive sufficient information to properly understand the applicant and assess the risks posed.
2023-11-07-T-064-S-02066,2023-11-07-T-064,2066,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Health whether there are any plans to expand or improve the capacity and facilities at Hougang Polyclinic.
2023-11-07-T-064-S-02067,2023-11-07-T-064,2067,Ong Ye Kung,National Healthcare Group Polyclinics will be carrying out renovation works at Hougang Polyclinic in early-2024. The polyclinic will remain operational during these works and efforts will be taken to minimise disruption. The works involve adding additional capacity to meet the medical needs of patients and is targeted to complete by the second quarter of 2025.
2023-11-07-T-065-S-02068,2023-11-07-T-065,2068,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Manpower regarding the planned unemployment support under the expanded SkillsFuture programme (a) what measures are in place to discourage dependency on unemployment support; (b) how will the system prevent excessive claims from individuals with additional income streams; (c) whether recipients will be mandated to actively seek job opportunities and attend interviews to remain eligible; and (d) what insights were gained from the administration of the COVID-19 recovery grant, where recipients were required to demonstrate active job seeking."
2023-11-07-T-065-S-02069,2023-11-07-T-065,2069,Tan See Leng,The Ministry of Manpower is studying the parameters for the scheme to support involuntarily unemployed workers to bounce back into jobs. More information will be announced when the parameters of the support scheme have been finalised.
2023-11-07-T-066-S-02070,2023-11-07-T-066,2070,Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for Health in light of lower social participation rates amongst male retirees (a) whether the set-up of a Silver Club with a range of social activities and programmes targeted at retiring seniors of different staff levels in the formal workforce can be explored; and (b) whether these retiring seniors can be automatically registered for such a Silver Club or another similar club, months prior to retirement for early engagement, with incentives for participation in the first year of retirement."
2023-11-07-T-066-S-02071,2023-11-07-T-066,2071,Ong Ye Kung,My response will also cover the matter raised in the question by Ms Rachel Ong
2023-11-07-T-066-S-02072,2023-11-07-T-066,2072,Ong Ye Kung,Age Well SG is a national programme to encourage seniors to lead active lifestyles and stay socially connected in communities. This is critical to ensure their well-being and stave off sickness.
2023-11-07-T-066-S-02073,2023-11-07-T-066,2073,Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health will be expanding and improving Active Ageing Centres (AACs) in communities to achieve this. AACs are to organize a wide range of activities and volunteering opportunities that meet the interests of all seniors. However, AACs can succeed only if it collaborates with all community partners, including grassroots organizations, the Health Promotion Board and various associations and groupings on the ground."
2023-11-07-T-066-S-02074,2023-11-07-T-066,2074,Ong Ye Kung,"Indeed, our experience has been that it is more difficult to persuade male seniors to participate in community activities and stay active. To increase their social participation rate, AACs organise activities like communal meals, group walks, pool playing and guitar jamming which tend to attract a larger male following. Initiatives like Silver Clubs will be very useful and very welcomed."
2023-11-07-T-067-S-02075,2023-11-07-T-067,2075,Murali Pillai,"asked the Prime Minister whether post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners can be extended to cover all in-patient treatments received at community hospitals, nursing homes and hospices, including palliative care, without referrals from the restructured hospitals."
2023-11-07-T-067-S-02076,2023-11-07-T-067,2076,Chan Chun Sing,"The post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners have been designed to cover direct reimbursement for acute care in restructured hospitals and post-discharge sub-acute and rehabilitative care in community hospitals, in accordance with the pensioner's medical benefits scheme and subject to prevailing guidelines. The post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners also include provision for MediShield Life premiums or additional MediSave contributions. Most pensioners are also eligible for support under the Pioneer or Merdeka Generation Packages, which include lifelong MediSave top-ups from the Government. Through the coverage provided for by MediShield Life and MediSave, pensioners can receive support for inpatient treatments in community hospitals, nursing homes and hospices, without referrals from restructured hospitals."
2023-11-07-T-068-S-02077,2023-11-07-T-068,2077,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) trial on the feasibility of mounting sensors on lamposts has concluded; and (b) if so, whether there are plans for a large-scale rollout of LaaP."
2023-11-07-T-068-S-02078,2023-11-07-T-068,2078,Josephine Teo,"The Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) trials were started in late 2017 to explore the technical and business feasibility of using lampposts to mount sensors. Trials were conducted in existing built-up areas in Geylang and one-north, and in a greenfield site at Punggol Northshore. The concept was based on the available technology and information at that point in time, with several other leading countries similarly exploring this concept."
2023-11-07-T-068-S-02079,2023-11-07-T-068,2079,Josephine Teo,"The technology has evolved since the start of the project, as expected. New and cost-effective options are now available to better meet the varied and dynamic operational needs of our agencies. For example, the use of mobile sensor deployment and fuel cells have brought about greater flexibility and a lower cost as compared to the use of fixed infrastructure like lampposts. Therefore, we have assessed that it is not practical to roll out the LaaP on a large-scale. However, the trial has resulted in positive outcomes, for example the development of data exchange platforms and governance models that allow Government agencies to share data from sensors."
2023-11-07-T-068-S-02080,2023-11-07-T-068,2080,Josephine Teo,"Trials are a necessary part of experimenting, learning and developing our processes and skills. The Government will continue to adopt a bold and agile approach for innovative projects that advance Singapore's smart city ambitions and transform our lived environment. Such an approach allows us to explore new and emerging technologies. We need to be able to scale technology solutions quickly across agencies when validated, or to pivot or discontinue projects and products when appropriate."
2023-11-07-T-069-S-02081,2023-11-07-T-069,2081,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Prime Minister in view that the recent disruptions of DBS and Citibank digital banking and payment services were reportedly caused by data centre failure, how does MAS plan to ensure that the banks’ IT infrastructure which is critical to banking operations have fail-safe and redundancy measures to meet with any surge in demand."
2023-11-07-T-069-S-02082,2023-11-07-T-069,2082,Lawrence Wong,This question has been answered in my reply to the Parliamentary Questions related to banking services disruption filed for yesterday's Sitting.
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02083,2023-11-07-T-070,2083,Sylvia Lim,asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the extent of current compliance by the banks in implementing the four obligations for financial institutions as set out in the Shared Responsibility Framework jointly issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority on 25 October 2023; and (b) how many phishing scam cases in the past two years involved potential breaches by banks of these four obligations.
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02084,2023-11-07-T-070,2084,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Prime Minister regarding the phishing scams intended to be covered by the Shared Responsibility Framework jointly issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority on 25 October 2023, what is the average and median amount of loss suffered by such victims in the last two years."
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02085,2023-11-07-T-070,2085,Lawrence Wong,The
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02086,2023-11-07-T-070,2086,Lawrence Wong,"This approach recognises the key roles of FIs and Telcos in preventing scams, and reflects the SRF's policy intent of strengthening their direct accountability to consumers. It incentivises FIs and Telcos to strictly uphold the desired standards of anti-scam controls."
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02087,2023-11-07-T-070,2087,Lawrence Wong,The duties defined for FIs in the SRF are built on a broader suite of measures that major retail banks are implementing to strengthen the security of digital banking in Singapore.
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02088,2023-11-07-T-070,2088,Lawrence Wong,"Based on data collected by the Police, MAS estimates there were about 15,000 phishing scam cases from 2021 to mid-2023, with an average loss of about $3,900 per case. We do not have data on the number of phishing scams that involve potential breaches of duties by FIs. But such data will be tracked under the SRF going forward."
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02089,2023-11-07-T-070,2089,Lawrence Wong,"Besides assigning accountability for scam losses, the important point is that full implementation by FIs and Telcos of their respective safeguards should materially reduce the risk of phishing scams in the first instance. As it stands today, the number of phishing scams has continued to rise in the first half of this year compared to the previous period, but has declined as a proportion of total scam cases, from 17% to 13%. The average loss per phishing scam has also declined by 20% over the same period. The Government will continue to monitor this closely. We have to stem this rising tide of scams and losses."
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02090,2023-11-07-T-070,2090,Lawrence Wong,"Dr Tan asked if the SRF would consider seniors with limited digital literacy when their bank phased out the use of physical hardware tokens. The retail banks already offer physical tokens for those customers who request them. Separate from the SRF, MAS has asked the banks to assess and implement customer authentication mechanisms that are more resistant to both phishing and malware attacks. When these measures are well developed, we can consider them for inclusion in the SRF."
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02091,2023-11-07-T-070,2091,Lawrence Wong,"We should see the SRF as part of broader suite of measures that the Government, banks and other ecosystem players have progressively implemented to tackle scams in Singapore. I covered these measures extensively in my response to the Adjournment Motion filed by Ms Lim in September. [Please refer to ""Losses from Scams and Malware Fraud  Doing Right by Bank Customers"", Official Report, 18 September 2023, Vol 95, Issue 111, Matter raised on Adjournment Motion section.]"
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02092,2023-11-07-T-070,2092,Lawrence Wong,"The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) released a media statement on 24 October 2023 outlining banks' efforts to protect consumers against scams, including through anti-scam measures and raising consumer awareness."
2023-11-07-T-070-S-02093,2023-11-07-T-070,2093,Lawrence Wong,"SRF is not the only means through which scam victims can seek assistance, as ABS announced that banks have discretionary goodwill payment frameworks for their scam victims beyond the SRF. Depending on the circumstances of each scam case, the sophistication of the scam typology, and the consumer's financial situation, banks have covered part or all of the losses incurred by scam victims. MAS has leaned on the banks to be even more accommodative in applying their goodwill payment frameworks. These goodwill frameworks complement the SRF which is intended to strengthen the direct accountability of FIs and Telcos to consumers when they have breached their defined duties."
2023-11-07-T-071-S-02094,2023-11-07-T-071,2094,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance over the last 10 years, what is Singapore’s Gini coefficient (i) before and (ii) after taxes and transfer, based on household income from all sources including work and non-work income, such as investments and property."
2023-11-07-T-071-S-02095,2023-11-07-T-071,2095,Lawrence Wong,The Department of Statistics publishes Singapore's Gini coefficients based on household income from work before and after taxes and transfers annually.
2023-11-07-T-071-S-02096,2023-11-07-T-071,2096,Lawrence Wong,"It is more challenging to include non-work income as such data are more prone to under-reporting and measurement errors. This is why the Department of Statistics has, thus far, not included such data in its computation of the Gini coefficient."
2023-11-07-T-071-S-02097,2023-11-07-T-071,2097,Lawrence Wong,"The Government will continue to explore ways to better measure household incomes. Regardless of the measurement issues, our approach remains to keep our social support measures progressive and targeted at the lower and middle-income households."
2023-11-07-T-072-S-02098,2023-11-07-T-072,2098,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs how many requests have been received from Singapore citizens and permanent residents for assistance to extricate themselves or their family members from the Israel-Palestine conflict area.
2023-11-07-T-072-S-02099,2023-11-07-T-072,2099,Vivian Balakrishnan,"This question for written answer was addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs during the debate on Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's Motion on “Solidarity, Security and Peace – The Israel-Hamas Conflict” on 6 November 2023. ["
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02100,2023-11-07-T-073,2100,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether an update can be provided on the planned collaborations with foreign counterparts to combat scams and recover scammed monies, especially for cases where the scammers are based overseas."
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02101,2023-11-07-T-073,2101,K Shanmugam,"The Ministry of Home Affairs has been engaging our foreign counterparts both bilaterally and in multilateral fora to cooperate in the fight against scams. These include the ASEAN Ministerial and Senior Officials Meetings on Transnational Crime, the ASEAN Senior Officials Roundtable on Cybercrime, the Global Anti-Scam Summit which took place recently in Lisbon, the Financial Action Task Force and INTERPOL."
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02102,2023-11-07-T-073,2102,K Shanmugam,We have three areas of interest.
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02103,2023-11-07-T-073,2103,K Shanmugam,"First, to enhance cross-border enforcement and asset recovery. The vast majority of scams are perpetrated by scammers based outside Singapore. These scammers run sophisticated operations with extensive networks and are adept at using technology to swiftly move funds, often across jurisdictions, to evade detection by the authorities. Our ability to solve scam cases and recover scammed monies depends very much on the level of cooperation provided by overseas law enforcement agencies, as well as their ability to stop the dissipation of the monies."
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02104,2023-11-07-T-073,2104,K Shanmugam,"In this last regard, we have been sharing with our foreign counterparts, the operational model of the Singapore Police Force's Anti-Scam Command, where law enforcement officers and bank staff are co-located. We encourage other countries to develop similar capabilities to seize funds quickly, so as to enhance our collective ability to recover scam proceeds."
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02105,2023-11-07-T-073,2105,K Shanmugam,"Second, we want industry stakeholders to implement more upstream measures to protect their users and collaborate with law enforcement agencies. In particular, we have observed that scammers are increasingly leveraging social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, and messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, to conduct their operations. We have therefore been engaging these platforms to implement safeguards, such as implementing user verification processes to ensure that accounts are legitimate. We would like to work with other countries to collectively engage these online platforms."
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02106,2023-11-07-T-073,2106,K Shanmugam,"Third, we continue to engage our foreign counterparts to exchange information on the latest scam variants and strategies to combat scams and learn from one another's experiences."
2023-11-07-T-073-S-02107,2023-11-07-T-073,2107,K Shanmugam,"In short, this transnational scourge is not something we can tackle alone. We need not just the cooperation of the public and the private sector, but need to work together across jurisdictions too."
2023-11-07-T-074-S-02108,2023-11-07-T-074,2108,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for each year since 2018, what is the ratio of local population to full-time SPF National Servicemen; and (b) how many Volunteer Special Constabulary officers are recruited for each year since 2018."
2023-11-07-T-074-S-02109,2023-11-07-T-074,2109,K Shanmugam,The ratio of Full-time National Servicemen in the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to the local population since 2018 is in Table 1 below.
2023-11-07-T-074-S-02110,2023-11-07-T-074,2110,K Shanmugam,
2023-11-07-T-074-S-02111,2023-11-07-T-074,2111,K Shanmugam,The total number of Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) officers and VSC (Community) officers recruited each year since 2018 is in Table 2 below.
2023-11-07-T-074-S-02112,2023-11-07-T-074,2112,K Shanmugam,
2023-11-07-T-074-S-02113,2023-11-07-T-074,2113,K Shanmugam,"The VSC (Community) vocation was launched in 2018 to create more opportunities for the public to join the VSC. They patrol in areas with high commuter traffic, facilitate crowd control and traffic management, carry out engagement at events and roadshows and assist with evacuation during an incident."
2023-11-07-T-075-S-02114,2023-11-07-T-075,2114,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Law what is the impact of the launch of the Public Defender's Office on the number of cases taken up by the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.
2023-11-07-T-075-S-02115,2023-11-07-T-075,2115,K Shanmugam,This question was addressed in the reply to Question No 6 for Oral Answer on the Order Paper for 7 November 2023. [
2023-11-07-T-076-S-02116,2023-11-07-T-076,2116,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how has the current high interest rate environment affected funding and borrowing for local startups; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing startups with more support to help them service their debts and continue to grow while they are still in their infancy stages of growth.
2023-11-07-T-076-S-02117,2023-11-07-T-076,2117,Gan Kim Yong,"A combination of factors, including the current high interest rate environment, macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, have resulted in lower equity funding for local startups. For the first nine months of 2023, the deal count for Singapore-based startups declined by 21%, compared to the same period in 2022"
2023-11-07-T-076-S-02118,2023-11-07-T-076,2118,Gan Kim Yong,"To support our startups' funding needs, we will continue to catalyse private sector investment through equity co-investment under the Startup SG Equity scheme, which aims to stimulate private sector investments into innovative, Singapore-based technology startups with intellectual property and global market potential."
2023-11-07-T-076-S-02119,2023-11-07-T-076,2119,Gan Kim Yong,"Startups could also leverage the Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS) to meet their various financing needs, such as for working capital, mergers and acquisition and fixed assets. In particular, the EFS – Venture Debt Programme, which was recently enhanced in March 2023 to support venture debt loans backed by Redeemable Convertible Preference Shares, allows startups with irregular cashflows to have more flexibility with loan repayments."
2023-11-07-T-077-S-02120,2023-11-07-T-077,2120,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry is aware of any investments, including contractual and supply chain links between Singaporean businesses or entities and the ongoing Rempang Eco-City project in Batam; and (b) if so, whether there are efforts to assess and reduce any negative effects on Singapore as a result of such involvement."
2023-11-07-T-077-S-02121,2023-11-07-T-077,2121,Gan Kim Yong,The Ministry of Trade and Industry is not aware of any investments involving Singapore businesses or entities in the Rempang Eco-City project in Batam.
2023-11-07-T-078-S-02122,2023-11-07-T-078,2122,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether platform companies can be incentivised to partner with vehicle leasing firms or companies with responsible contractual practices for the lease of vehicles to vocational drivers or riders.
2023-11-07-T-078-S-02123,2023-11-07-T-078,2123,Gan Kim Yong,This question has been addressed by the oral reply to Questions 35 and 36 on the Order Paper for 7 November 2023. [

2023-11-07-T-079-S-02125,2023-11-07-T-079,2125,Chee Hong Tat,This question has been addressed in the reply to Questions 8 and 9 at the 7 November 2023 Parliament sitting. [
2023-11-07-T-080-S-02126,2023-11-07-T-080,2126,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the ERP 2.0 system (a) what is the estimated cost to (i) dismantle all the present In-Vehicle Unit (ii) retrofit the new On-Board Units and (iii) maintain the new unit in all vehicles; (b) whether the Ministry has conducted any cost-benefit analysis relative to the current system; and (c) what is the Ministry's estimated timeframe for the completion of rollout of the new system.
2023-11-07-T-080-S-02127,2023-11-07-T-080,2127,Chee Hong Tat,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) awarded the ERP 2.0 project to the consortium formed by NCS Pte Ltd and MHI Engine System Asia Pte Ltd at a cost of $556 million in 2016. As the project is still ongoing, details of the project costs will only be finalised upon completion."
2023-11-07-T-080-S-02128,2023-11-07-T-080,2128,Chee Hong Tat,"LTA had assessed that it is less costly to replace the current ERP system with ERP 2.0 based on Global Navigation Satellite System technology, compared to extending the existing system. The On-Board Unit installation exercise is expected to be completed by end 2025."
2023-11-07-T-081-S-02129,2023-11-07-T-081,2129,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what measures are being explored to tackle high-rise littering when the design of HDB blocks renders the use of CCTVs infeasible.
2023-11-07-T-081-S-02130,2023-11-07-T-081,2130,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) deploys surveillance cameras with video analytics to record acts of high-rise littering. In a small number of cases, deployment of surveillance cameras is not possible due to the design and layout of the block. For such cases, NEA will step up educational outreach to households in the affected stack, conduct stakeouts and initiate investigations if there are eyewitness accounts."
2023-11-07-T-081-S-02131,2023-11-07-T-081,2131,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We urge residents to be considerate and not commit high-rise littering acts, which is an anti-social behaviour that threatens public safety and hygiene. The statutory presumption provision on littering from residential flats, introduced from 1 July 2023, has placed greater onus on flat owners and tenants to prevent such acts."
2023-11-07-T-081-S-02132,2023-11-07-T-081,2132,Grace Fu Hai Yien,
2023-11-07-T-082-S-02133,2023-11-07-T-082,2133,Keith Chua,asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the planned counsellor-to-student ratio at schools and Institutes of Higher Learning in 2024; and (b) whether the current provision of counsellors is adequate to provide early intervention on the mental health needs of students.
2023-11-07-T-082-S-02134,2023-11-07-T-082,2134,Chan Chun Sing,"All schools are resourced with one to two School Counsellors, while each polytechnic and ITE college currently has an average of six counsellors. The autonomous universities similarly employ a varying number of counsellors depending on their enrolment and students' needs."
2023-11-07-T-082-S-02135,2023-11-07-T-082,2135,Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond relying on counsellors to address students' mental health issues, schools and Institutes of Higher Learning also tap on an ecosystem of support comprising student peer-support networks, teachers, flexi adjunct and para-counsellors for support, as well as mental health resources in the community, such as the Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH) teams for further assessment and intervention. Students are also equipped with resilience-building skills, such as emotional regulation, help-seeking and problem solving to strengthen their sense of wellbeing. These provisions are regularly reviewed to ensure they are responsive to students' needs."
2023-11-07-T-083-S-02136,2023-11-07-T-083,2136,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each of the past five years (a) what is the number of Child Protection Service (CPS) officers; and (b) what is the mean and median number of cases that each CPS officer manages.
2023-11-07-T-083-S-02137,2023-11-07-T-083,2137,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the last five years, the number of Child Protection Officers has increased by about 33%, to around 60 officers in 2022. Each officer handles about 40 cases at any point in time."
2023-11-07-T-084-S-02138,2023-11-07-T-084,2138,Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Health whether there are steps being initiated to ensure the affordability and accessibility of mental health insurance, especially for individuals in lower-income brackets and, if so, what are they."
2023-11-07-T-084-S-02139,2023-11-07-T-084,2139,Ong Ye Kung,This question has been addressed in my reply to Question No. 46 to 49 for written answers on the Order Paper for 6 November 2023. [
2023-11-07-T-085-S-02140,2023-11-07-T-085,2140,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Health for each of the past five years, what is the mean and median waiting time for a patient to receive psychiatric help at the Institute of Mental Health."
2023-11-07-T-085-S-02141,2023-11-07-T-085,2141,Ong Ye Kung,Individuals referred to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) by the police for further assessment under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act are attended to quickly and there is no significant wait.
2023-11-07-T-085-S-02142,2023-11-07-T-085,2142,Ong Ye Kung,"For other referrals, the mean and median waiting time for new subsidised psychiatrist appointments at IMH for each of the past five years are shown in the table below."
2023-11-07-T-085-S-02143,2023-11-07-T-085,2143,Ong Ye Kung,
2023-11-07-T-085-S-02144,2023-11-07-T-085,2144,Ong Ye Kung,IMH employs a triage system to ascertain the urgency of the conditions of patients. Those with conditions which are more severe or who require more urgent assistance are given earlier appointments. IMH also supports various service providers in managing individuals with mild to moderate symptoms in the community to ensure that individuals with mental health needs have prompt access to appropriate care.
2023-11-07-T-086-S-02145,2023-11-07-T-086,2145,Hazel Poa,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has studied how private insurance plans, such as Integrated Shield Plans, can remain sustainable without having to reject new applications based on pre-existing conditions; and (b) whether there are any plans to explicitly forbid private insurance companies from rejecting new applications for insurance plans based on pre-existing conditions and, if not, why not."
2023-11-07-T-086-S-02146,2023-11-07-T-086,2146,Ong Ye Kung,"For insurance plans to remain sustainable without rejecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, a large risk pool comprising both healthy and unhealthy individuals is necessary. This is why MediShield Life (MSHL), our national health insurance scheme, was designed to cover all Singapore Residents from birth, regardless of pre-existing conditions."
2023-11-07-T-086-S-02147,2023-11-07-T-086,2147,Ong Ye Kung,"Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) and other private health insurance plans offer optional coverage on top of MSHL. As these are private products, underwriting decisions are subject to insurers' commercial and actuarial considerations."
2023-11-07-T-086-S-02148,2023-11-07-T-086,2148,Ong Ye Kung,"If insurers cannot reject applicants with pre-existing conditions, they may have to increase premiums for all policyholders to ensure that their insurance risk pool remains sustainable."
2023-11-07-T-086-S-02149,2023-11-07-T-086,2149,Ong Ye Kung,"Depending on their underwriting practices, insurers may still offer coverage to applicants with pre-existing conditions, but with exclusions or risk loading, that is, higher premiums. This allows such applicants to benefit from some coverage without adversely affecting other policyholders."
2023-11-07-T-087-S-02150,2023-11-07-T-087,2150,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Health (a) which of the MPOWER tobacco control interventions recommended under the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have yet to be implemented in Singapore; and (b) what steps will the Government take to ensure that Singapore achieves best-practice levels in all MPOWER measures.
2023-11-07-T-087-S-02151,2023-11-07-T-087,2151,Ong Ye Kung,"Singapore has implemented all of the recommended MPOWER measures. We have attained the highest level of achievement in the following areas  monitor tobacco use and prevention policies, offer help to quit tobacco use and warn about the dangers of tobacco (health warnings). Areas in which Singapore has yet to attain the highest level of achievement are  protect people from tobacco smoke, warn about the dangers of tobacco (mass media), enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and raise taxes on tobacco."
2023-11-07-T-087-S-02152,2023-11-07-T-087,2152,Ong Ye Kung,The Ministry of Health will continue to review and enhance our tobacco control measures and work with the relevant agencies to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Singapore.
2023-11-07-T-088-S-02153,2023-11-07-T-088,2153,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider including a recommendation for teenage boys to be vaccinated by choice against the Human Papillomavirus in the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule, in line with recommendations by other health authorities in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia; and (b) if not, why."
2023-11-07-T-088-S-02154,2023-11-07-T-088,2154,Ong Ye Kung,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is nationally recommended for females aged nine to 26 years, as the Ministry of Health (MOH) has assessed that this is a clinically effective and cost-effective strategy for preventing cervical cancer."
2023-11-07-T-088-S-02155,2023-11-07-T-088,2155,Ong Ye Kung,"On the other hand, males do not get cervical cancer. While HPV vaccination also confers protection against HPV-related anal cancer, the incidence amongst males is about ten times lower than cervical cancer amongst females. As such, HPV vaccination of males does not provide the same level of benefit as for females, nor is it likely to be cost-effective at the population level. Nevertheless, males who feel that they are at high risk of getting HPV may choose to go for HPV vaccination at a general practitioner clinic."
2023-11-07-T-088-S-02156,2023-11-07-T-088,2156,Ong Ye Kung,MOH will continue to monitor for new developments and review our policy on HPV vaccination where necessary.
2023-11-07-T-089-S-02157,2023-11-07-T-089,2157,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Health whether the Health Sciences Authority will consider regulating do-it-yourself aesthetic injectable kits and requiring such injections to be administered by qualified medical practitioners to ensure the safety of patients.
2023-11-07-T-089-S-02158,2023-11-07-T-089,2158,Ong Ye Kung,Dermal fillers and botulinum toxin injections are health products which must be registered by Health Sciences Authority (HSA) before they can be supplied in Singapore. They should only be administered by qualified medical practitioners for patient safety and consumers are strongly advised against using do-it-yourself injectable kits which are marketed for aesthetic purposes.
2023-11-07-T-089-S-02159,2023-11-07-T-089,2159,Ong Ye Kung,"HSA conducts regular surveillance of local websites and e-commerce platforms to promptly take down product listings of such do-it-yourself injectable kits. Anyone caught selling these products without an appropriate licence can be fined up to $50,000 and/or jailed for up to two years under the Health Products Act."
2023-11-07-T-090-S-02160,2023-11-07-T-090,2160,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in each of the past five years, what was the take-up rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) (i) bivalent (ii) quadrivalent and (iii) 9-valent vaccines by adults aged between 18 and 64; and (b) whether the Ministry plans to (i) include HPV 9-valent vaccines under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule and (ii) provide subsidies and allow the use of MediSave for HPV 9-valent vaccines for those aged between 27 and 64 years."
2023-11-07-T-090-S-02161,2023-11-07-T-090,2161,Ong Ye Kung,The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is nationally recommended for females aged nine to 26 years for prevention of cervical cancer in females. No HPV vaccine has been approved by the Health Sciences Authority for use in persons older than 45 years.
2023-11-07-T-090-S-02162,2023-11-07-T-090,2162,Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health does not have data on HPV vaccination by vaccine type across all ages. However, as HPV vaccination is offered to all Secondary 1 female students, our records show that in 2022, more than 90% of Secondary 1 female students have received the vaccine."

Hence, it is not included under the national immunisation schedules and is not eligible for subsidy or MediSave claims."

2023-11-07-T-091-S-02165,2023-11-07-T-091,2165,Ong Ye Kung,"The National Mental Health Office will comprise officers from, the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Education. It will function as one integrated office within MOH and adopt a citizen-centric approach to the implementation of the Strategy and the development of future mental health and well-being initiatives."

2023-11-07-T-093-S-02170,2023-11-07-T-093,2170,Josephine Teo,"The Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Scheme covers disputes over billing and unsolicited charges for telecommunications and media services which are licensed by IMDA. These include mobile, fibre broadband and pay TV services. Services that are not licensed by IMDA, such as billing-on-behalf services, are excluded from the Scheme as these are outside IMDA’s regulatory mandate and authority."
2023-11-07-T-093-S-02171,2023-11-07-T-093,2171,Josephine Teo,"For disputes concerning services which are not licensed by IMDA, consumers continue to have access to a range of dispute resolution options, such as the Consumers Association of Singapore and the Small Claims Tribunal."

2023-11-07-T-094-S-02173,2023-11-07-T-094,2173,Josephine Teo,"IMDA's Start Digital (SD) programme provides easy-to-deploy digital solutions to new companies or those that have yet to digitalise. To date, about 1,320 companies in the education sector and 220 in the exercise sector have adopted SD solutions."
2023-11-07-T-094-S-02174,2023-11-07-T-094,2174,Josephine Teo,"IMDA's Data Protection Essentials (DPE) programme is designed to support SMEs in acquiring a basic level of data protection and security to protect their customers' personal data and recover quickly from a data breach. Since its inception in April 2022, there have been over 100 applications for the DPE one-stop professional service (“Service”). The Service helps SMEs to set up data security practices and incident management plans, provides data protection and cyber awareness training to the SME's staff and comes with a one-year retainer service that includes software updates and reviews of the SME's systems and data handling processes."
2023-11-07-T-094-S-02175,2023-11-07-T-094,2175,Josephine Teo,"Most of the applications for the Service come from SMEs in sectors, such as healthcare and IT which handle a large amount of personal data (more than 500 individuals). Over 40% of the applications are from micro-SMEs. Specifically, four applications are from the education sector and none are from the exercise sector. To date, 50% of all applicants have successfully implemented the Service, while the remaining are at different stages of implementation."
2023-11-07-T-094-S-02176,2023-11-07-T-094,2176,Josephine Teo,"Different SMEs have varying data protection needs depending on the volume and type of data they handle. IMDA has been collaborating with various sector champions to promote the DPE, including in the education and exercise sectors. For example, IMDA is partnering the Committee for Private Education to encourage small-to-medium private education institutions to adopt the DPE to protect their customers' personal data. IMDA will also continue to encourage all SMEs that handle a large amount of personal data to adopt the DPE, including SMEs in the exercise sector. The data protection measures will aid SMEs in upholding confidence and trust among their customers as they digitalise their processes and services."

2023-11-07-T-095-S-02179,2023-11-07-T-095,2179,Josephine Teo,"Wireless@SG complements Singapore's fixed and mobile connectivity services. The key difference between Wireless@SG and other Wi-Fi services is that Wireless@SG provides a harmonised platform for the public to seamlessly access free Wi-Fi services across all participating Wireless@SG operators. It is typically deployed at public locations with higher footfall or where people tend to congregate for longer periods, for example, hawker centres, community centres, libraries and shopping malls, to support our increasing connectivity needs. From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 1.8 million unique logins per month, 98% of which were by residents"
2023-11-07-T-095-S-02180,2023-11-07-T-095,2180,Josephine Teo,"When the Wireless@SG programme was launched in 2006, IMDA had provided some initial funding support to Wireless@SG operators to defray one-time capital costs and encourage widespread deployment. Today, interested venue owners can contract with any of the four appointed Wireless@SG operators – Singtel, StarHub, M1 and SIMBA. Although IMDA may provide periodic funding to enhance the security and bandwidth of Wireless@SG, the main financial costs are carried by the operators and venue owners who pay for the deployment as well as ongoing maintenance and upgrades of the Wi-Fi hotspots. This arrangement is sustainable and can continue so long as venue owners see value in providing free Wi-Fi services for their customers through the convenient log-in access provided by Wireless@SG operators."
2023-11-07-T-096-S-02181,2023-11-07-T-096,2181,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Manpower in view of the recent case of foreigners working illegally as food delivery riders in Singapore without valid work passes (a) whether there are routine checks conducted to identify such foreigners, especially those using foreign-registered vehicles; (b) what penalties apply to platforms that engage such foreigners; (c) whether there are plans for stricter penalties on account holders who abet such offences; and (d) to date, how many cases of illegal food delivery by foreigners have been apprehended."
2023-11-07-T-096-S-02182,2023-11-07-T-096,2182,Tan See Leng,"The nature of food delivery work is decentralised and mobile. Hence, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) relies mainly on complaints to detect possible instances of foreigners working illegally as food delivery riders, in order to carry out enforcement actions."
2023-11-07-T-096-S-02183,2023-11-07-T-096,2183,Tan See Leng,"From 2018 till 18 October 2023, MOM received a total of 163 complaints on suspected illegal foreign delivery riders. Our investigations established that the majority of these complaints were unsubstantiated as the foreigners were either legitimate work pass holders employed by the food and beverage establishments as in-house deliverymen, or there was insufficient information or evidence to warrant further action. Enforcement actions were eventually taken against 10 foreigners."
2023-11-07-T-096-S-02184,2023-11-07-T-096,2184,Tan See Leng,"Platform companies or any party found to have abetted the illegal employment are liable to the same penalties as the foreigners who worked illegally as food delivery riders in Singapore without valid work passes, which is a fine not exceeding $20,000, imprisonment for up to two years, or both. This is already one of the higher penalties under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act."

2023-11-07-T-097-S-02186,2023-11-07-T-097,2186,Tan See Leng,We publish data on the proportion of retrenched residents who re-entered employment within six months post-retrenchment from 2000 onwards on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) website.
2023-11-07-T-097-S-02187,2023-11-07-T-097,2187,Tan See Leng,"The data for the proportion of those who re-entered employment in the same sector is available annually in the fourth quarter's Labour Market Report. The requested time series is provided below in Table 1, where around two-thirds re-entered into a different industry since 2009. While wage data for the requested time series is not available, a 2021 MOM study found that retrenched residents who re-entered employment in the same industry from which they were retrenched were more likely to receive similar or higher wages in their new roles, compared to those who switch industries. This is expected as employers tend to place more value on workers' prior industry-specific experience."

MOM has existing guidelines on advertising practices and advisories have been issued to EAs placing MDWs."
